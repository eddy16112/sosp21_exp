{"id": "10983", "revid": "2051880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10983", "title": "First-order logic", "text": "First-order logic\u2014also known as predicate logic, quantificational logic, and first-order predicate calculus\u2014is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as \"Socrates is a man\", one can have expressions in the form \"there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man\", where \"there exists\"\"\" is a quantifier, while \"x\" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations; in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.\nA theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse (over which the quantified variables range), finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold about them. Sometimes, \"theory\" is understood in a more formal sense, which is just a set of sentences in first-order logic.\nThe adjective \"first-order\" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which one or both of predicate quantifiers or function quantifiers are permitted. In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.\nThere are many deductive systems for first-order logic which are both sound (i.e., all provable statements are true in all models) and complete (i.e. all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable, much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory, such as the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem.\nFirst-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms, and is studied in the foundations of mathematics.\nPeano arithmetic and Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic.\nNo first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the real line. Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, categorical axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as second-order logic.\nThe foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce. For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see Jos\u00e9 Ferreir\u00f3s (2001).\nIntroduction.\nWhile propositional logic deals with simple declarative propositions, first-order logic additionally covers predicates and quantification.\nA predicate takes an entity or entities in the domain of discourse as input while outputs are either True or False. Consider the two sentences \"Socrates is a philosopher\" and \"Plato is a philosopher\". In propositional logic, these sentences are viewed as being unrelated, and might be denoted, for example, by variables such as \"p\" and \"q\". The predicate \"is a philosopher\" occurs in both sentences, which have a common structure of \"\"a\" is a philosopher\". The variable \"a\" is instantiated as \"Socrates\" in the first sentence, and is instantiated as \"Plato\" in the second sentence. While first-order logic allows for the use of predicates, such as \"is a philosopher\" in this example, propositional logic does not.\nRelationships between predicates can be stated using logical connectives. Consider, for example, the first-order formula \"if \"a\" is a philosopher, then \"a\" is a scholar\". This formula is a conditional statement with \"\"a\" is a philosopher\" as its hypothesis, and \"\"a\" is a scholar\" as its conclusion. The truth of this formula depends on which object is denoted by \"a\", and on the interpretations of the predicates \"is a philosopher\" and \"is a scholar\".\nQuantifiers can be applied to variables in a formula. The variable \"a\" in the previous formula can be universally quantified, for instance, with the first-order sentence \"For every \"a\", if \"a\" is a philosopher, then \"a\" is a scholar\". The universal quantifier \"for every\" in this sentence expresses the idea that the claim \"if \"a\" is a philosopher, then \"a\" is a scholar\" holds for \"all\" choices of \"a\".\nThe \"negation\" of the sentence \"For every \"a\", if \"a\" is a philosopher, then \"a\" is a scholar\" is logically equivalent to the sentence \"There exists \"a\" such that \"a\" is a philosopher and \"a\" is not a scholar\". The existential quantifier \"there exists\" expresses the idea that the claim \"\"a\" is a philosopher and \"a\" is not a scholar\" holds for \"some\" choice of \"a\".\nThe predicates \"is a philosopher\" and \"is a scholar\" each take a single variable. In general, predicates can take several variables. In the first-order sentence \"Socrates is the teacher of Plato\", the predicate \"is the teacher of\" takes two variables.\nAn interpretation (or model) of a first-order formula specifies what each predicate means, and the entities that can instantiate the variables. These entities form the domain of discourse or universe, which is usually required to be a nonempty set. For example, in an interpretation with the domain of discourse consisting of all human beings and the predicate \"is a philosopher\" understood as \"was the author of the \"Republic\"\", the sentence \"There exists \"a\" such that \"a\" is a philosopher\" is seen as being true, as witnessed by Plato.\nSyntax.\nThere are two key parts of first-order logic. The syntax determines which finite sequences of symbols are well-formed expressions in first-order logic, while the semantics determines the meanings behind these expressions.\nAlphabet.\nUnlike natural languages, such as English, the language of first-order logic is completely formal, so that it can be mechanically determined whether a given expression is well formed. There are two key types of well-formed expressions: terms, which intuitively represent objects, and formulas, which intuitively express predicates that can be true or false. The terms and formulas of first-order logic are strings of symbols, where all the symbols together form the alphabet of the language. As with all formal languages, the nature of the symbols themselves is outside the scope of formal logic; they are often regarded simply as letters and punctuation symbols.\nIt is common to divide the symbols of the alphabet into logical symbols, which always have the same meaning, and non-logical symbols, whose meaning varies by interpretation. For example, the logical symbol formula_1 always represents \"and\"; it is never interpreted as \"or\", which is represented by the logical symbol formula_2. On the other hand, a non-logical predicate symbol such as Phil(\"x\") could be interpreted to mean \"\"x\" is a philosopher\", \"\"x\" is a man named Philip\", or any other unary predicate depending on the interpretation at hand.\nLogical symbols.\nThere are several logical symbols in the alphabet, which vary by author but usually include:\nNot all of these symbols are required\u2013only one of the quantifiers, negation and conjunction, variables, brackets and equality suffice. There are numerous minor variations that may define additional logical symbols:\nNon-logical symbols.\nThe non-logical symbols represent predicates (relations), functions and constants on the domain of discourse. It used to be standard practice to use a fixed, infinite set of non-logical symbols for all purposes. A more recent practice is to use different non-logical symbols according to the application one has in mind. Therefore, it has become necessary to name the set of all non-logical symbols used in a particular application. This choice is made via a signature.\nThe traditional approach is to have only one, infinite, set of non-logical symbols (one signature) for all applications. Consequently, under the traditional approach there is only one language of first-order logic. This approach is still common, especially in philosophically oriented books.\nIn contemporary mathematical logic, the signature varies by application. Typical signatures in mathematics are {1, \u00d7} or just {\u00d7} for groups, or {0, 1, +, \u00d7, &lt;} for ordered fields. There are no restrictions on the number of non-logical symbols. The signature can be empty, finite, or infinite, even uncountable. Uncountable signatures occur for example in modern proofs of the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem.\nIn this approach, every non-logical symbol is of one of the following types.\nThe traditional approach can be recovered in the modern approach, by simply specifying the \"custom\" signature to consist of the traditional sequences of non-logical symbols.\nFormation rules.\nThe formation rules define the terms and formulas of first-order logic. When terms and formulas are represented as strings of symbols, these rules can be used to write a formal grammar for terms and formulas. These rules are generally context-free (each production has a single symbol on the left side), except that the set of symbols may be allowed to be infinite and there may be many start symbols, for example the variables in the case of terms.\nTerms.\nThe set of terms is inductively defined by the following rules:\nOnly expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1 and 2 are terms. For example, no expression involving a predicate symbol is a term.\nFormulas.\nThe set of formulas (also called well-formed formulas or WFFs) is inductively defined by the following rules:\nOnly expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1\u20135 are formulas. The formulas obtained from the first two rules are said to be atomic formulas.\nFor example,\nis a formula, if \"f\" is a unary function symbol, \"P\" a unary predicate symbol, and Q a ternary predicate symbol. On the other hand, formula_11 is not a formula, although it is a string of symbols from the alphabet.\nThe role of the parentheses in the definition is to ensure that any formula can only be obtained in one way\u2014by following the inductive definition (i.e., there is a unique parse tree for each formula). This property is known as unique readability of formulas. There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas. For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, or change the places in which parentheses are inserted. Each author's particular definition must be accompanied by a proof of unique readability.\nThis definition of a formula does not support defining an if-then-else function ite(c, a, b), where \"c\" is a condition expressed as a formula, that would return \"a\" if c is true, and \"b\" if it is false. This is because both predicates and functions can only accept terms as parameters, but the first parameter is a formula. Some languages built on first-order logic, such as SMT-LIB 2.0, add this.\nNotational conventions.\nFor convenience, conventions have been developed about the precedence of the logical operators, to avoid the need to write parentheses in some cases. These rules are similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. A common convention is:\nMoreover, extra punctuation not required by the definition may be inserted\u2014to make formulas easier to read. Thus the formula\nmight be written as\nIn some fields, it is common to use infix notation for binary relations and functions, instead of the prefix notation defined above. For example, in arithmetic, one typically writes \"2 + 2 = 4\" instead of \"=(+(2,2),4)\". It is common to regard formulas in infix notation as abbreviations for the corresponding formulas in prefix notation, cf. also term structure vs. representation.\nThe definitions above use infix notation for binary connectives such as formula_15. A less common convention is Polish notation, in which one writes formula_4, formula_20 and so on in front of their arguments rather than between them. This convention is advantageous in that it allows all punctuation symbols to be discarded. As such, Polish notation is compact and elegant, but rarely used in practice because it is hard for humans to read. In Polish notation, the formula\nbecomes \nFree and bound variables.\nIn a formula, a variable may occur free or bound (or both). Intuitively, a variable occurrence is free in a formula if it is not quantified: in \u2200\"y\" \"P\"(\"x\", \"y\"), the sole occurrence of variable \"x\" is free while that of \"y\" is bound. The free and bound variable occurrences in a formula are defined inductively as follows.\nFor example, in \u2200\"x\" \u2200\"y\" (\"P\"(\"x\") \u2192 \"Q\"(\"x\",\"f\"(\"x\"),\"z\")), \"x\" and \"y\" occur only bound, \"z\" occurs only free, and \"w\" is neither because it does not occur in the formula.\nFree and bound variables of a formula need not be disjoint sets: in the formula \"P\"(\"x\") \u2192 \u2200\"x\" \"Q\"(\"x\"), the first occurrence of \"x\", as argument of \"P\", is free while the second one, as argument of \"Q\", is bound.\nA formula in first-order logic with no free variable occurrences is called a first-order sentence. These are the formulas that will have well-defined truth values under an interpretation. For example, whether a formula such as Phil(\"x\") is true must depend on what \"x\" represents. But the sentence \u2203\"x\" Phil(\"x\") will be either true or false in a given interpretation.\nExample: ordered abelian groups.\nIn mathematics, the language of ordered abelian groups has one constant symbol 0, one unary function symbol \u2212, one binary function symbol +, and one binary relation symbol \u2264. Then:\nThe axioms for ordered abelian groups can be expressed as a set of sentences in the language. For example, the axiom stating that the group is commutative is usually written formula_24\nSemantics.\nAn interpretation of a first-order language assigns a denotation to each non-logical symbol in that language. It also determines a domain of discourse that specifies the range of the quantifiers. The result is that each term is assigned an object that it represents, each predicate is assigned a property of objects, and each sentence is assigned a truth value. In this way, an interpretation provides semantic meaning to the terms, the predicates, and formulas of the language. The study of the interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics. What follows is a description of the standard or Tarskian semantics for first-order logic. (It is also possible to define game semantics for first-order logic, but aside from requiring the axiom of choice, game semantics agree with Tarskian semantics for first-order logic, so game semantics will not be elaborated herein.)\nThe domain of discourse \"D\" is a nonempty set of \"objects\" of some kind. Intuitively, a first-order formula is a statement about these objects; for example, formula_25 states the existence of an object \"x\" such that the predicate \"P\" is true where referred to it. The domain of discourse is the set of considered objects. For example, one can take formula_26 to be the set of integer numbers.\nThe interpretation of a function symbol is a function. For example, if the domain of discourse consists of integers, a function symbol \"f\" of arity 2 can be interpreted as the function that gives the sum of its arguments. In other words, the symbol \"f\" is associated with the function \"I(f)\" which, in this interpretation, is addition.\nThe interpretation of a constant symbol is a function from the one-element set \"D\"0 to \"D\", which can be simply identified with an object in \"D\". For example, an interpretation may assign the value formula_27 to the constant symbol formula_28.\nThe interpretation of an \"n\"-ary predicate symbol is a set of \"n\"-tuples of elements of the domain of discourse. This means that, given an interpretation, a predicate symbol, and \"n\" elements of the domain of discourse, one can tell whether the predicate is true of those elements according to the given interpretation. For example, an interpretation \"I(P)\" of a binary predicate symbol \"P\" may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate \"P\" would be true if its first argument is less than the second.\nFirst-order structures.\nThe most common way of specifying an interpretation (especially in mathematics) is to specify a structure (also called a model; see below). The structure consists of a nonempty set \"D\" that forms the domain of discourse and an interpretation \"I\" of the non-logical terms of the signature. This interpretation is itself a function:\nEvaluation of truth values.\nA formula evaluates to true or false given an interpretation, and a variable assignment \u03bc that associates an element of the domain of discourse with each variable. The reason that a variable assignment is required is to give meanings to formulas with free variables, such as formula_34. The truth value of this formula changes depending on whether \"x\" and \"y\" denote the same individual.\nFirst, the variable assignment \u03bc can be extended to all terms of the language, with the result that each term maps to a single element of the domain of discourse. The following rules are used to make this assignment:\nNext, each formula is assigned a truth value. The inductive definition used to make this assignment is called the T-schema.\nIf a formula does not contain free variables, and so is a sentence, then the initial variable assignment does not affect its truth value. In other words, a sentence is true according to \"M\" and formula_52 if and only if it is true according to \"M\" and every other variable assignment formula_53.\nThere is a second common approach to defining truth values that does not rely on variable assignment functions. Instead, given an interpretation \"M\", one first adds to the signature a collection of constant symbols, one for each element of the domain of discourse in \"M\"; say that for each \"d\" in the domain the constant symbol \"c\"\"d\" is fixed. The interpretation is extended so that each new constant symbol is assigned to its corresponding element of the domain. One now defines truth for quantified formulas syntactically, as follows:\nThis alternate approach gives exactly the same truth values to all sentences as the approach via variable assignments.\nValidity, satisfiability, and logical consequence.\nIf a sentence \u03c6 evaluates to True under a given interpretation \"M\", one says that \"M\" satisfies \u03c6; this is denoted formula_69. A sentence is satisfiable if there is some interpretation under which it is true.\nSatisfiability of formulas with free variables is more complicated, because an interpretation on its own does not determine the truth value of such a formula. The most common convention is that a formula with free variables is said to be satisfied by an interpretation if the formula remains true regardless which individuals from the domain of discourse are assigned to its free variables. This has the same effect as saying that a formula is satisfied if and only if its universal closure is satisfied.\nA formula is logically valid (or simply valid) if it is true in every interpretation. These formulas play a role similar to tautologies in propositional logic.\nA formula \u03c6 is a logical consequence of a formula \u03c8 if every interpretation that makes \u03c8 true also makes \u03c6 true. In this case one says that \u03c6 is logically implied by \u03c8.\nAlgebraizations.\nAn alternate approach to the semantics of first-order logic proceeds via abstract algebra. This approach generalizes the Lindenbaum\u2013Tarski algebras of propositional logic. There are three ways of eliminating quantified variables from first-order logic that do not involve replacing quantifiers with other variable binding term operators:\nThese algebras are all lattices that properly extend the two-element Boolean algebra.\nTarski and Givant (1987) showed that the fragment of first-order logic that has no atomic sentence lying in the scope of more than three quantifiers has the same expressive power as relation algebra. This fragment is of great interest because it suffices for Peano arithmetic and most axiomatic set theory, including the canonical ZFC. They also prove that first-order logic with a primitive ordered pair is equivalent to a relation algebra with two ordered pair projection functions.\nFirst-order theories, models, and elementary classes.\nA first-order theory of a particular signature is a set of axioms, which are sentences consisting of symbols from that signature. The set of axioms is often finite or recursively enumerable, in which case the theory is called effective. Some authors require theories to also include all logical consequences of the axioms. The axioms are considered to hold within the theory and from them other sentences that hold within the theory can be derived.\nA first-order structure that satisfies all sentences in a given theory is said to be a model of the theory. An elementary class is the set of all structures satisfying a particular theory. These classes are a main subject of study in model theory.\nMany theories have an intended interpretation, a certain model that is kept in mind when studying the theory. For example, the intended interpretation of Peano arithmetic consists of the usual natural numbers with their usual operations. However, the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows that most first-order theories will also have other, nonstandard models.\nA theory is consistent if it is not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory. A theory is complete if, for every formula in its signature, either that formula or its negation is a logical consequence of the axioms of the theory. G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem shows that effective first-order theories that include a sufficient portion of the theory of the natural numbers can never be both consistent and complete.\nFor more information on this subject see List of first-order theories and Theory (mathematical logic)\nEmpty domains.\nThe definition above requires that the domain of discourse of any interpretation must be nonempty. There are settings, such as inclusive logic, where empty domains are permitted. Moreover, if a class of algebraic structures includes an empty structure (for example, there is an empty poset), that class can only be an elementary class in first-order logic if empty domains are permitted or the empty structure is removed from the class.\nThere are several difficulties with empty domains, however:\nThus, when the empty domain is permitted, it must often be treated as a special case. Most authors, however, simply exclude the empty domain by definition.\nDeductive systems.\nA deductive system is used to demonstrate, on a purely syntactic basis, that one formula is a logical consequence of another formula. There are many such systems for first-order logic, including Hilbert-style deductive systems, natural deduction, the sequent calculus, the tableaux method, and resolution. These share the common property that a deduction is a finite syntactic object; the format of this object, and the way it is constructed, vary widely. These finite deductions themselves are often called derivations in proof theory. They are also often called proofs, but are completely formalized unlike natural-language mathematical proofs.\nA deductive system is sound if any formula that can be derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a deductive system is complete if every logically valid formula is derivable. All of the systems discussed in this article are both sound and complete. They also share the property that it is possible to effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called effective.\nA key property of deductive systems is that they are purely syntactic, so that derivations can be verified without considering any interpretation. Thus a sound argument is correct in every possible interpretation of the language, regardless whether that interpretation is about mathematics, economics, or some other area.\nIn general, logical consequence in first-order logic is only semidecidable: if a sentence A logically implies a sentence B then this can be discovered (for example, by searching for a proof until one is found, using some effective, sound, complete proof system). However, if A does not logically imply B, this does not mean that A logically implies the negation of B. There is no effective procedure that, given formulas A and B, always correctly decides whether A logically implies B.\nRules of inference.\nA rule of inference states that, given a particular formula (or set of formulas) with a certain property as a hypothesis, another specific formula (or set of formulas) can be derived as a conclusion. The rule is sound (or truth-preserving) if it preserves validity in the sense that whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis, that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion.\nFor example, one common rule of inference is the rule of substitution. If \"t\" is a term and \u03c6 is a formula possibly containing the variable \"x\", then \u03c6[\"t\"/\"x\"] is the result of replacing all free instances of \"x\" by \"t\" in \u03c6. The substitution rule states that for any \u03c6 and any term \"t\", one can conclude \u03c6[\"t\"/\"x\"] from \u03c6 provided that no free variable of \"t\" becomes bound during the substitution process. (If some free variable of \"t\" becomes bound, then to substitute \"t\" for \"x\" it is first necessary to change the bound variables of \u03c6 to differ from the free variables of \"t\".)\nTo see why the restriction on bound variables is necessary, consider the logically valid formula \u03c6 given by formula_73, in the signature of (0,1,+,\u00d7,=) of arithmetic. If \"t\" is the term \"x + 1\", the formula \u03c6[\"t\"/\"y\"] is formula_74, which will be false in many interpretations. The problem is that the free variable \"x\" of \"t\" became bound during the substitution. The intended replacement can be obtained by renaming the bound variable \"x\" of \u03c6 to something else, say \"z\", so that the formula after substitution is formula_75, which is again logically valid.\nThe substitution rule demonstrates several common aspects of rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; one can tell whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, as is often the case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.\nHilbert-style systems and natural deduction.\nA deduction in a Hilbert-style deductive system is a list of formulas, each of which is a logical axiom, a hypothesis that has been assumed for the derivation at hand, or follows from previous formulas via a rule of inference. The logical axioms consist of several axiom schemas of logically valid formulas; these encompass a significant amount of propositional logic. The rules of inference enable the manipulation of quantifiers. Typical Hilbert-style systems have a small number of rules of inference, along with several infinite schemas of logical axioms. It is common to have only modus ponens and universal generalization as rules of inference.\nNatural deduction systems resemble Hilbert-style systems in that a deduction is a finite list of formulas. However, natural deduction systems have no logical axioms; they compensate by adding additional rules of inference that can be used to manipulate the logical connectives in formulas in the proof.\nSequent calculus.\nThe sequent calculus was developed to study the properties of natural deduction systems. Instead of working with one formula at a time, it uses sequents, which are expressions of the form\nwhere A1, ..., A\"n\", B1, ..., B\"k\" are formulas and the turnstile symbol formula_77 is used as punctuation to separate the two halves. Intuitively, a sequent expresses the idea that formula_78 implies formula_79.\nTableaux method.\nUnlike the methods just described, the derivations in the tableaux method are not lists of formulas. Instead, a derivation is a tree of formulas. To show that a formula A is provable, the tableaux method attempts to demonstrate that the negation of A is unsatisfiable. The tree of the derivation has formula_80 at its root; the tree branches in a way that reflects the structure of the formula. For example, to show that formula_81 is unsatisfiable requires showing that C and D are each unsatisfiable; this corresponds to a branching point in the tree with parent formula_81 and children C and D.\nResolution.\nThe resolution rule is a single rule of inference that, together with unification, is sound and complete for first-order logic. As with the tableaux method, a formula is proved by showing that the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable. Resolution is commonly used in automated theorem proving.\nThe resolution method works only with formulas that are disjunctions of atomic formulas; arbitrary formulas must first be converted to this form through Skolemization. The resolution rule states that from the hypotheses formula_83 and formula_84, the conclusion formula_85 can be obtained.\nProvable identities.\nMany identities can be proved, which establish equivalences between particular formulas. These identities allow for rearranging formulas by moving quantifiers across other connectives, and are useful for putting formulas in prenex normal form. Some provable identities include:\nEquality and its axioms.\nThere are several different conventions for using equality (or identity) in first-order logic. The most common convention, known as first-order logic with equality, includes the equality symbol as a primitive logical symbol which is always interpreted as the real equality relation between members of the domain of discourse, such that the \"two\" given members are the same member. This approach also adds certain axioms about equality to the deductive system employed. These equality axioms are:\nThese are axiom schemas, each of which specifies an infinite set of axioms. The third schema is known as Leibniz's law, \"the principle of substitutivity\", \"the indiscernibility of identicals\", or \"the replacement property\". The second schema, involving the function symbol \"f\", is (equivalent to) a special case of the third schema, using the formula\nMany other properties of equality are consequences of the axioms above, for example:\nFirst-order logic without equality.\nAn alternate approach considers the equality relation to be a non-logical symbol. This convention is known as first-order logic without equality. If an equality relation is included in the signature, the axioms of equality must now be added to the theories under consideration, if desired, instead of being considered rules of logic. The main difference between this method and first-order logic with equality is that an interpretation may now interpret two distinct individuals as \"equal\" (although, by Leibniz's law, these will satisfy exactly the same formulas under any interpretation). That is, the equality relation may now be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation on the domain of discourse that is congruent with respect to the functions and relations of the interpretation.\nWhen this second convention is followed, the term normal model is used to refer to an interpretation where no distinct individuals \"a\" and \"b\" satisfy \"a\" = \"b\". In first-order logic with equality, only normal models are considered, and so there is no term for a model other than a normal model. When first-order logic without equality is studied, it is necessary to amend the statements of results such as the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem so that only normal models are considered.\nFirst-order logic without equality is often employed in the context of second-order arithmetic and other higher-order theories of arithmetic, where the equality relation between sets of natural numbers is usually omitted.\nDefining equality within a theory.\nIf a theory has a binary formula \"A\"(\"x\",\"y\") which satisfies reflexivity and Leibniz's law, the theory is said to have equality, or to be a theory with equality. The theory may not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms, but rather as derivable theorems. For example, in theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations, it is possible to define equality in terms of the relations, by defining the two terms \"s\" and \"t\" to be equal if any relation is unchanged by changing \"s\" to \"t\" in any argument.\nSome theories allow other \"ad hoc\" definitions of equality:\nMetalogical properties.\nOne motivation for the use of first-order logic, rather than higher-order logic, is that first-order logic has many metalogical properties that stronger logics do not have. These results concern general properties of first-order logic itself, rather than properties of individual theories. They provide fundamental tools for the construction of models of first-order theories.\nCompleteness and undecidability.\nG\u00f6del's completeness theorem, proved by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1929, establishes that there are sound, complete, effective deductive systems for first-order logic, and thus the first-order logical consequence relation is captured by finite provability. Naively, the statement that a formula \u03c6 logically implies a formula \u03c8 depends on every model of \u03c6; these models will in general be of arbitrarily large cardinality, and so logical consequence cannot be effectively verified by checking every model. However, it is possible to enumerate all finite derivations and search for a derivation of \u03c8 from \u03c6. If \u03c8 is logically implied by \u03c6, such a derivation will eventually be found. Thus first-order logical consequence is semidecidable: it is possible to make an effective enumeration of all pairs of sentences (\u03c6,\u03c8) such that \u03c8 is a logical consequence of\u00a0\u03c6.\nUnlike propositional logic, first-order logic is undecidable (although semidecidable), provided that the language has at least one predicate of arity at least 2 (other than equality). This means that there is no decision procedure that determines whether arbitrary formulas are logically valid. This result was established independently by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in 1936 and 1937, respectively, giving a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem posed by David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928. Their proofs demonstrate a connection between the unsolvability of the decision problem for first-order logic and the unsolvability of the halting problem.\nThere are systems weaker than full first-order logic for which the logical consequence relation is decidable. These include propositional logic and monadic predicate logic, which is first-order logic restricted to unary predicate symbols and no function symbols. Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the guarded fragment of first-order logic, as well as two-variable logic. The Bernays\u2013Sch\u00f6nfinkel class of first-order formulas is also decidable. Decidable subsets of first-order logic are also studied in the framework of description logics.\nThe L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem.\nThe L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows that if a first-order theory of cardinality \u03bb has an infinite model, then it has models of every infinite cardinality greater than or equal to \u03bb. One of the earliest results in model theory, it implies that it is not possible to characterize countability or uncountability in a first-order language with a countable signature. That is, there is no first-order formula \u03c6(\"x\") such that an arbitrary structure M satisfies \u03c6 if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable (or, in the second case, uncountable).\nThe L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem implies that infinite structures cannot be categorically axiomatized in first-order logic. For example, there is no first-order theory whose only model is the real line: any first-order theory with an infinite model also has a model of cardinality larger than the continuum. Since the real line is infinite, any theory satisfied by the real line is also satisfied by some nonstandard models. When the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem is applied to first-order set theories, the nonintuitive consequences are known as Skolem's paradox.\nThe compactness theorem.\nThe compactness theorem states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. This implies that if a formula is a logical consequence of an infinite set of first-order axioms, then it is a logical consequence of some finite number of those axioms. This theorem was proved first by Kurt G\u00f6del as a consequence of the completeness theorem, but many additional proofs have been obtained over time. It is a central tool in model theory, providing a fundamental method for constructing models.\nThe compactness theorem has a limiting effect on which collections of first-order structures are elementary classes. For example, the compactness theorem implies that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models has an infinite model. Thus the class of all finite graphs is not an elementary class (the same holds for many other algebraic structures).\nThere are also more subtle limitations of first-order logic that are implied by the compactness theorem. For example, in computer science, many situations can be modeled as a directed graph of states (nodes) and connections (directed edges). Validating such a system may require showing that no \"bad\" state can be reached from any \"good\" state. Thus one seeks to determine if the good and bad states are in different connected components of the graph. However, the compactness theorem can be used to show that connected graphs are not an elementary class in first-order logic, and there is no formula \u03c6(\"x\",\"y\") of first-order logic, in the logic of graphs, that expresses the idea that there is a path from \"x\" to \"y\". Connectedness can be expressed in second-order logic, however, but not with only existential set quantifiers, as formula_100 also enjoys compactness.\nLindstr\u00f6m's theorem.\nPer Lindstr\u00f6m showed that the metalogical properties just discussed actually characterize first-order logic in the sense that no stronger logic can also have those properties (Ebbinghaus and Flum 1994, Chapter XIII). Lindstr\u00f6m defined a class of abstract logical systems, and a rigorous definition of the relative strength of a member of this class. He established two theorems for systems of this type:\nLimitations.\nAlthough first-order logic is sufficient for formalizing much of mathematics, and is commonly used in computer science and other fields, it has certain limitations. These include limitations on its expressiveness and limitations of the fragments of natural languages that it can describe.\nFor instance, first-order logic is undecidable, meaning a sound, complete and terminating decision algorithm for provability is impossible. This has led to the study of interesting decidable fragments, such as C2: first-order logic with two variables and the counting quantifiers formula_101 and formula_102.\nExpressiveness.\nThe L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows that if a first-order theory has any infinite model, then it has infinite models of every cardinality. In particular, no first-order theory with an infinite model can be categorical. Thus there is no first-order theory whose only model has the set of natural numbers as its domain, or whose only model has the set of real numbers as its domain. Many extensions of first-order logic, including infinitary logics and higher-order logics, are more expressive in the sense that they do permit categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers or real numbers. This expressiveness comes at a metalogical cost, however: by Lindstr\u00f6m's theorem, the compactness theorem and the downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem cannot hold in any logic stronger than first-order.\nFormalizing natural languages.\nFirst-order logic is able to formalize many simple quantifier constructions in natural language, such as \"every person who lives in Perth lives in Australia\". But there are many more complicated features of natural language that cannot be expressed in (single-sorted) first-order logic. \"Any logical system which is appropriate as an instrument for the analysis of natural language needs a much richer structure than first-order predicate logic\".\nRestrictions, extensions, and variations.\nThere are many variations of first-order logic. Some of these are inessential in the sense that they merely change notation without affecting the semantics. Others change the expressive power more significantly, by extending the semantics through additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols. For example, infinitary logics permit formulas of infinite size, and modal logics add symbols for possibility and necessity.\nRestricted languages.\nFirst-order logic can be studied in languages with fewer logical symbols than were described above.\nRestrictions such as these are useful as a technique to reduce the number of inference rules or axiom schemas in deductive systems, which leads to shorter proofs of metalogical results. The cost of the restrictions is that it becomes more difficult to express natural-language statements in the formal system at hand, because the logical connectives used in the natural language statements must be replaced by their (longer) definitions in terms of the restricted collection of logical connectives. Similarly, derivations in the limited systems may be longer than derivations in systems that include additional connectives. There is thus a trade-off between the ease of working within the formal system and the ease of proving results about the formal system.\nIt is also possible to restrict the arities of function symbols and predicate symbols, in sufficiently expressive theories. One can in principle dispense entirely with functions of arity greater than 2 and predicates of arity greater than 1 in theories that include a pairing function. This is a function of arity 2 that takes pairs of elements of the domain and returns an ordered pair containing them. It is also sufficient to have two predicate symbols of arity 2 that define projection functions from an ordered pair to its components. In either case it is necessary that the natural axioms for a pairing function and its projections are satisfied.\nMany-sorted logic.\nOrdinary first-order interpretations have a single domain of discourse over which all quantifiers range. Many-sorted first-order logic allows variables to have different sorts, which have different domains. This is also called typed first-order logic, and the sorts called types (as in data type), but it is not the same as first-order type theory. Many-sorted first-order logic is often used in the study of second-order arithmetic.\nWhen there are only finitely many sorts in a theory, many-sorted first-order logic can be reduced to single-sorted first-order logic.\nOne introduces into the single-sorted theory a unary predicate symbol for each sort in the many-sorted theory, and adds an axiom saying that these unary predicates partition the domain of discourse. For example, if there are two sorts, one adds predicate symbols formula_129 and formula_130 and the axiom\nThen the elements satisfying formula_132 are thought of as elements of the first sort, and elements satisfying formula_133 as elements of the second sort. One can quantify over each sort by using the corresponding predicate symbol to limit the range of quantification. For example, to say there is an element of the first sort satisfying formula \u03c6(\"x\"), one writes\nAdditional quantifiers.\nAdditional quantifiers can be added to first-order logic.\nInfinitary logics.\nInfinitary logic allows infinitely long sentences. For example, one may allow a conjunction or disjunction of infinitely many formulas, or quantification over infinitely many variables. Infinitely long sentences arise in areas of mathematics including topology and model theory.\nInfinitary logic generalizes first-order logic to allow formulas of infinite length. The most common way in which formulas can become infinite is through infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. However, it is also possible to admit generalized signatures in which function and relation symbols are allowed to have infinite arities, or in which quantifiers can bind infinitely many variables. Because an infinite formula cannot be represented by a finite string, it is necessary to choose some other representation of formulas; the usual representation in this context is a tree. Thus formulas are, essentially, identified with their parse trees, rather than with the strings being parsed.\nThe most commonly studied infinitary logics are denoted \"L\"\u03b1\u03b2, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are each either cardinal numbers or the symbol \u221e. In this notation, ordinary first-order logic is \"L\"\u03c9\u03c9.\nIn the logic \"L\"\u221e\u03c9, arbitrary conjunctions or disjunctions are allowed when building formulas, and there is an unlimited supply of variables. More generally, the logic that permits conjunctions or disjunctions with less than \u03ba constituents is known as \"L\"\u03ba\u03c9. For example, \"L\"\u03c91\u03c9 permits countable conjunctions and disjunctions.\nThe set of free variables in a formula of \"L\"\u03ba\u03c9 can have any cardinality strictly less than \u03ba, yet only finitely many of them can be in the scope of any quantifier when a formula appears as a subformula of another. In other infinitary logics, a subformula may be in the scope of infinitely many quantifiers. For example, in \"L\"\u03ba\u221e, a single universal or existential quantifier may bind arbitrarily many variables simultaneously. Similarly, the logic \"L\"\u03ba\u03bb permits simultaneous quantification over fewer than \u03bb variables, as well as conjunctions and disjunctions of size less than \u03ba.\nFixpoint logic.\nFixpoint logic extends first-order logic by adding the closure under the least fixed points of positive operators.\nHigher-order logics.\nThe characteristic feature of first-order logic is that individuals can be quantified, but not predicates. Thus\nis a legal first-order formula, but\nis not, in most formalizations of first-order logic. Second-order logic extends first-order logic by adding the latter type of quantification. Other higher-order logics allow quantification over even higher types than second-order logic permits. These higher types include relations between relations, functions from relations to relations between relations, and other higher-type objects. Thus the \"first\" in first-order logic describes the type of objects that can be quantified.\nUnlike first-order logic, for which only one semantics is studied, there are several possible semantics for second-order logic. The most commonly employed semantics for second-order and higher-order logic is known as full semantics. The combination of additional quantifiers and the full semantics for these quantifiers makes higher-order logic stronger than first-order logic. In particular, the (semantic) logical consequence relation for second-order and higher-order logic is not semidecidable; there is no effective deduction system for second-order logic that is sound and complete under full semantics.\nSecond-order logic with full semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, it is possible to create axiom systems in second-order logic that uniquely characterize the natural numbers and the real line. The cost of this expressiveness is that second-order and higher-order logics have fewer attractive metalogical properties than first-order logic. For example, the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem and compactness theorem of first-order logic become false when generalized to higher-order logics with full semantics.\nAutomated theorem proving and formal methods.\nAutomated theorem proving refers to the development of computer programs that search and find derivations (formal proofs) of mathematical theorems. Finding derivations is a difficult task because the search space can be very large; an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but computationally infeasible for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated heuristic functions are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search.\nThe related area of automated proof verification uses computer programs to check that human-created proofs are correct. Unlike complicated automated theorem provers, verification systems may be small enough that their correctness can be checked both by hand and through automated software verification. This validation of the proof verifier is needed to give confidence that any derivation labeled as \"correct\" is actually correct.\nSome proof verifiers, such as Metamath, insist on having a complete derivation as input. Others, such as Mizar and Isabelle, take a well-formatted proof sketch (which may still be very long and detailed) and fill in the missing pieces by doing simple proof searches or applying known decision procedures: the resulting derivation is then verified by a small, core \"kernel\". Many such systems are primarily intended for interactive use by human mathematicians: these are known as proof assistants. They may also use formal logics that are stronger than first-order logic, such as type theory. Because a full derivation of any nontrivial result in a first-order deductive system will be extremely long for a human to write, results are often formalized as a series of lemmas, for which derivations can be constructed separately.\nAutomated theorem provers are also used to implement formal verification in computer science. In this setting, theorem provers are used to verify the correctness of programs and of hardware such as processors with respect to a formal specification. Because such analysis is time-consuming and thus expensive, it is usually reserved for projects in which a malfunction would have grave human or financial consequences.\nFor the problem of model checking, efficient algorithms are known to decide whether an input finite structure satisfies a first-order formula, in addition to computational complexity bounds: see Model checking#First-order logic."}

Functors were first considered in algebraic topology, where algebraic objects (such as the fundamental group) are associated to topological spaces, and maps between these algebraic objects are associated to continuous maps between spaces. Nowadays, functors are used throughout modern mathematics to relate various categories. Thus, functors are important in all areas within mathematics to which category theory is applied.\nThe words \"category\" and \"functor\" were borrowed by mathematicians from the philosophers Aristotle and Rudolf Carnap, respectively. The latter used \"functor\" in a linguistic context;\nsee function word.\nDefinition.\nLet \"C\" and \"D\" be categories. A functor \"F\" from \"C\" to \"D\" is a mapping that\nThat is, functors must preserve identity morphisms and composition of morphisms.\nCovariance and contravariance.\nThere are many constructions in mathematics that would be functors but for the fact that they \"turn morphisms around\" and \"reverse composition\". We then define a contravariant functor \"F\" from \"C\" to \"D\" as a mapping that\nNote that contravariant functors reverse the direction of composition.\nOrdinary functors are also called covariant functors in order to distinguish them from contravariant ones. Note that one can also define a contravariant functor as a \"covariant\" functor on the opposite category formula_19. Some authors prefer to write all expressions covariantly. That is, instead of saying formula_20 is a contravariant functor, they simply write formula_21 (or sometimes formula_22) and call it a functor.\nContravariant functors are also occasionally called \"cofunctors\".\nThere is a convention which refers to \"vectors\"\u2014i.e., vector fields, elements of the space of sections formula_23 of a tangent bundle formula_24\u2014as \"contravariant\" and to \"covectors\"\u2014i.e., 1-forms, elements of the space of sections formula_25 of a cotangent bundle formula_26\u2014as \"covariant\". This terminology originates in physics, and its rationale has to do with the position of the indices (\"upstairs\" and \"downstairs\") in expressions such as formula_27 for formula_28 or formula_29 for formula_30 In this formalism it is observed that the coordinate transformation symbol formula_31 (representing the matrix formula_32) acts on the basis vectors \"in the same way\" as on the \"covector coordinates\": formula_33\u2014whereas it acts \"in the opposite way\" on the \"vector coordinates\" (but \"in the same way\" as on the basis covectors: formula_34). This terminology is contrary to the one used in category theory because it is the covectors that have \"pullbacks\" in general and are thus \"contravariant\", whereas vectors in general are \"covariant\" since they can be \"pushed forward\". See also Covariance and contravariance of vectors.\nOpposite functor.\nEvery functor formula_20 induces the opposite functor formula_36, where formula_19 and formula_38 are the opposite categories to formula_39 and formula_40. By definition, formula_41 maps objects and morphisms identically to formula_42. Since formula_19 does not coincide with formula_39 as a category, and similarly for formula_40, formula_41 is distinguished from formula_42. For example, when composing formula_48 with formula_49, one should use either formula_50 or formula_51. Note that, following the property of opposite category, formula_52.\nBifunctors and multifunctors.\nA bifunctor (also known as a binary functor) is a functor whose domain is a product category. For example, the Hom functor is of the type . It can be seen as a functor in \"two\" arguments. The Hom functor is a natural example; it is contravariant in one argument, covariant in the other.\nA multifunctor is a generalization of the functor concept to \"n\" variables. So, for example, a bifunctor is a multifunctor with .\nExamples.\nDiagram: For categories \"C\" and \"J\", a diagram of type \"J\" in \"C\" is a covariant functor formula_53.\n(Category theoretical) presheaf: For categories \"C\" and \"J\", a \"J\"-presheaf on \"C\" is a contravariant functor formula_54.\nPresheaves: If \"X\" is a topological space, then the open sets in \"X\" form a partially ordered set Open(\"X\") under inclusion. Like every partially ordered set, Open(\"X\") forms a small category by adding a single arrow if and only if formula_55. Contravariant functors on Open(\"X\") are called \"presheaves\" on \"X\". For instance, by assigning to every open set \"U\" the associative algebra of real-valued continuous functions on \"U\", one obtains a presheaf of algebras on \"X\".\nConstant functor: The functor which maps every object of \"C\" to a fixed object \"X\" in \"D\" and every morphism in \"C\" to the identity morphism on \"X\". Such a functor is called a \"constant\" or \"selection\" functor.\nEndofunctor: A functor that maps a category to that same category; e.g., polynomial functor.\nIdentity functor: in category \"C\", written 1\"C\" or id\"C\", maps an object to itself and a morphism to itself. The identity functor is an endofunctor.\nDiagonal functor: The diagonal functor is defined as the functor from \"D\" to the functor category \"D\"\"C\" which sends each object in \"D\" to the constant functor at that object.\nLimit functor: For a fixed index category \"J\", if every functor has a limit (for instance if \"C\" is complete), then the limit functor assigns to each functor its limit. The existence of this functor can be proved by realizing that it is the right-adjoint to the diagonal functor and invoking the Freyd adjoint functor theorem. This requires a suitable version of the axiom of choice. Similar remarks apply to the colimit functor (which assigns to every functor its colimit, and is covariant).\nPower sets: The power set functor maps each set to its power set and each function formula_56 to the map which sends formula_57 to its image formula_58. One can also consider the contravariant power set functor which sends formula_59 to the map which\nsends formula_60 to its inverse image formula_61\nFor example, if formula_62 then formula_63. Suppose formula_64 and formula_65. Then formula_66 is the function which sends any subset formula_67 of formula_1 to its image formula_69, which in this case means\nformula_70, where formula_71 denotes the mapping under formula_66, so this could also be written as formula_73. For the other values, formula_74 Note that formula_75 consequently generates the trivial topology on formula_1. Also note that although the function formula_77 in this example mapped to the power set of formula_1, that need not be the case in general.\nFundamental group: Consider the category of pointed topological spaces, i.e. topological spaces with distinguished points. The objects are pairs , where \"X\" is a topological space and \"x\"0 is a point in \"X\". A morphism from to is given by a continuous map with .\nTo every topological space \"X\" with distinguished point \"x\"0, one can define the fundamental group based at \"x\"0, denoted . This is the group of homotopy classes of loops based at \"x\"0. If is a morphism of pointed spaces, then every loop in \"X\" with base point \"x\"0 can be composed with \"f\" to yield a loop in \"Y\" with base point \"y\"0. This operation is compatible with the homotopy equivalence relation and the composition of loops, and we get a group homomorphism from to . We thus obtain a functor from the category of pointed topological spaces to the category of groups.\nIn the category of topological spaces (without distinguished point), one considers homotopy classes of generic curves, but they cannot be composed unless they share an endpoint. Thus one has the fundamental groupoid instead of the fundamental group, and this construction is functorial.\nAlgebra of continuous functions: a contravariant functor from the category of topological spaces (with continuous maps as morphisms) to the category of real associative algebras is given by assigning to every topological space \"X\" the algebra C(\"X\") of all real-valued continuous functions on that space. Every continuous map induces an algebra homomorphism by the rule for every \"\u03c6\" in C(\"Y\").\nTangent and cotangent bundles: The map which sends every differentiable manifold to its tangent bundle and every smooth map to its derivative is a covariant functor from the category of differentiable manifolds to the category of vector bundles.\nDoing this constructions pointwise gives the tangent space, a covariant functor from the category of pointed differentiable manifolds to the category of real vector spaces. Likewise, cotangent space is a contravariant functor, essentially the composition of the tangent space with the dual space above.\nGroup actions/representations: Every group \"G\" can be considered as a category with a single object whose morphisms are the elements of \"G\". A functor from \"G\" to Set is then nothing but a group action of \"G\" on a particular set, i.e. a \"G\"-set. Likewise, a functor from \"G\" to the category of vector spaces, Vect\"K\", is a linear representation of \"G\". In general, a functor can be considered as an \"action\" of \"G\" on an object in the category \"C\". If \"C\" is a group, then this action is a group homomorphism.\nLie algebras: Assigning to every real (complex) Lie group its real (complex) Lie algebra defines a functor.\nTensor products: If \"C\" denotes the category of vector spaces over a fixed field, with linear maps as morphisms, then the tensor product formula_79 defines a functor which is covariant in both arguments.\nForgetful functors: The functor which maps a group to its underlying set and a group homomorphism to its underlying function of sets is a functor. Functors like these, which \"forget\" some structure, are termed \"forgetful functors\". Another example is the functor which maps a ring to its underlying additive abelian group. Morphisms in Rng (ring homomorphisms) become morphisms in Ab (abelian group homomorphisms).\nFree functors: Going in the opposite direction of forgetful functors are free functors. The free functor sends every set \"X\" to the free group generated by \"X\". Functions get mapped to group homomorphisms between free groups. Free constructions exist for many categories based on structured sets. See free object.\nHomomorphism groups: To every pair \"A\", \"B\" of abelian groups one can assign the abelian group Hom(\"A\", \"B\") consisting of all group homomorphisms from \"A\" to \"B\". This is a functor which is contravariant in the first and covariant in the second argument, i.e. it is a functor (where Ab denotes the category of abelian groups with group homomorphisms). If and are morphisms in Ab, then the group homomorphism : is given by . See Hom functor.\nRepresentable functors: We can generalize the previous example to any category \"C\". To every pair \"X\", \"Y\" of objects in \"C\" one can assign the set of morphisms from \"X\" to \"Y\". This defines a functor to Set which is contravariant in the first argument and covariant in the second, i.e. it is a functor . If and are morphisms in \"C\", then the map is given by .\nFunctors like these are called representable functors. An important goal in many settings is to determine whether a given functor is representable.\nProperties.\nTwo important consequences of the functor axioms are:\nOne can compose functors, i.e. if \"F\" is a functor from \"A\" to \"B\" and \"G\" is a functor from \"B\" to \"C\" then one can form the composite functor from \"A\" to \"C\". Composition of functors is associative where defined. Identity of composition of functors is the identity functor. This shows that functors can be considered as morphisms in categories of categories, for example in the category of small categories.\nA small category with a single object is the same thing as a monoid: the morphisms of a one-object category can be thought of as elements of the monoid, and composition in the category is thought of as the monoid operation. Functors between one-object categories correspond to monoid homomorphisms. So in a sense, functors between arbitrary categories are a kind of generalization of monoid homomorphisms to categories with more than one object.\nRelation to other categorical concepts.\nLet \"C\" and \"D\" be categories. The collection of all functors from \"C\" to \"D\" forms the objects of a category: the functor category. Morphisms in this category are natural transformations between functors.\nFunctors are often defined by universal properties; examples are the tensor product, the direct sum and direct product of groups or vector spaces, construction of free groups and modules, direct and inverse limits. The concepts of limit and colimit generalize several of the above.\nUniversal constructions often give rise to pairs of adjoint functors.\nComputer implementations.\nFunctors sometimes appear in functional programming. For instance, the programming language Haskell has a class codice_1 where codice_2 is a polytypic function used to map functions (\"morphisms\" on \"Hask\", the category of Haskell types) between existing types to functions between some new types."}

The next year he initiated efforts to emigrate to the United States, but was unable to make arrangements to receive a research fellowship. On 26 January 1942, Felix Hausdorff, along with his wife and his sister-in-law, committed suicide by taking an overdose of veronal, rather than comply with German orders to move to the Endenich camp, and there suffer the likely implications, about which he held no illusions.\nLife.\nChildhood and youth.\nHausdorff's father, the Jewish merchant Louis Hausdorff (1843\u20131896), moved in the autumn of 1870 with his young family to Leipzig and worked over time at various companies, including a linen-and cotton goods factory. He was an educated man and had become a Morenu at the age of 14. There are several treatises from his pen, including a long work on the Aramaic translations of the Bible from the perspective of Talmudic law.\nHausdorff's mother, Hedwig (1848\u20131902), who is also referred to in various documents as Johanna, came from the Jewish Tietz family. From another branch of this family came Hermann Tietz, founder of the first department store, and later co-owner of the department store chain called \"Hermann Tietz\". During the period of Nazi dictatorship the name was \"Aryanised\" to Hertie.\nFrom 1878 to 1887 Felix Hausdorff attended the Nicolai School in Leipzig, a facility that had a reputation as a hotbed of humanistic education. He was an excellent student, class leader for many years and often recited self-written Latin or German poems at school celebrations. In his graduation in 1887 (with two Oberprimen), he was the only one who reached the highest grade.\nThe choice of subject was not easy for Hausdorff. Magda Dierkesmann, who was often a guest in the home of Hausdorff as a student in Bonn in the years 1926\u20131932, reported in 1967 that:\nThe decision was made to study the sciences in high school.\nDegree, doctorate and habilitation.\nFrom summer term 1887 to summer semester 1891 Hausdorff studied mathematics and astronomy, mainly in his native city of Leipzig, interrupted by one semester in Freiburg (summer semester 1888) and Berlin (winter semester 1888/1889). The surviving testimony of other students show him as extremely versatile interested young man, who, in addition to the mathematical and astronomical lectures, attended lectures in physics, chemistry and geography, and also lectures on philosophy and history of philosophy as well as on issues of language, literature and social sciences. In Leipzig he heard lectures on the history of music from musicologist Paul. His early love of music lasted a lifetime; in Hausdorff's house there were impressive musical evenings with the landlord at the piano, according to witness statements made by various participants. Even as a student in Leipzig, he was an admirer and connoisseur of the music of Richard Wagner.\nIn later semesters of his studies, Hausdorff was close to Heinrich Bruns (1848\u20131919). \nBruns was professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at the University of Leipzig. Under him, Hausdorff graduated in 1891 with a work on the theory of astronomical refraction of light in the atmosphere. Two publications on the same subject followed, and in 1895 his habilitation also followed with a thesis on the absorbance of light in the atmosphere. These early astronomical works of Hausdorff have\u2014despite their excellent mathematical working through\u2014not gained importance.\nFirstly, the underlying idea of Bruns has not proved viable (there were needs for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, which\u2014as Julius Bauschinger could show a little later\u2014in principle can not be obtained with the required accuracy). On the other hand, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data (weather balloon ascents) has since made the painstaking accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary. In the time between PhD and habilitation Hausdorff completed the yearlong-volunteer military requirement and worked for two years as a human computer at the observatory in Leipzig.\nDocent in Leipzig.\nWith his habilitation, Hausdorff became a lecturer at the University of Leipzig and began an extensive teaching in a variety of mathematical areas. In addition to teaching and research in mathematics, he went with his literary and philosophical inclinations. A man of varied interests, educated, highly sensitive and sophisticated in thinking, feeling and experiencing, he frequented in his Leipzig period with a number of famous writers, artists and publishers such as Hermann Conradi, Richard Dehmel, Otto Erich Hartleben, Gustav Kirstein, Max Klinger, Max Reger and Frank Wedekind. The years 1897 to about 1904 mark the high point of his literary and philosophical creativity, during which time 18 of his 22 pseudonymous works were published, including a book of poetry, a play, an epistemological book and a volume of aphorisms.\nHausdorff married Charlotte Goldschmidt in 1899, daughter of Jewish doctor Siegismund Goldschmidt. Her stepmother was the famous suffragist and preschool teacher Henriette Goldschmidt. Hausdorff's only child, daughter Lenore (Nora), was born in 1900; she survived the era of National Socialism and enjoyed a long life, dying in Bonn in 1991.\nFirst professorship.\nIn December 1901 Hausdorff was appointed as adjunct associate professor at the University of Leipzig. The often repeated assertion that Hausdorff got a call from G\u00f6ttingen and rejected it cannot be verified and is probably wrong. When applying in Leipzig, Dean Kirchner had been led to very positive vote of his colleagues, written by Heinrich Bruns, still accompanied by the following words:\nThis quote emphasizes the undisguised anti-Semitism present, which especially took a sharp upturn after the Gr\u00fcnderkrach in 1873 throughout the German Reich. Leipzig was a center of anti-Semitic movement, especially among the student body. This may well be the reason that Hausdorff did not feel at ease at Leipzig. Another reason was perhaps the stresses due to the hierarchical posturing of the Leipzig professors.\nAfter his habilitation, Hausdorff wrote another work on optics, on non-Euclidean geometry, and on hypercomplex number systems, as well as two papers on probability theory. However, his main area of work soon became set theory, especially the theory of ordered sets. It was initially a philosophical interest, which led him around 1897 to study Georg Cantor's work. Already, in the summer semester of 1901, Hausdorff gave a lecture on set theory. This was one of the first lectures on set theory at all; Ernst Zermelo's lectures in G\u00f6ttingen College during the winter semester of 1900/1901 were a little earlier. That year, he published his first paper on order types in which he examined a generalization of well-orderings called graded order types, where a linear order is graded if no two of its segments share the same order type. He generalized the Cantor\u2013Bernstein theorem, which said the collection of countable order types has the cardinality of the continuum and showed that the collection of all graded types of an idempotent cardinality has a cardinality of 2.\nFor the summer semester 1910 Hausdorff was appointed as professor to the University of Bonn. In Bonn, he began a lecture on set theory, which he repeated in the summer semester 1912, substantially revised and expanded.\nIn the summer of 1912 he also began work on his magnum opus, the book \"Basics of set theory\". It was completed in Greifswald, where Hausdorff had been appointed for the summer semester as full professor in 1913, and was released in April 1914.\nThe University of Greifswald was the smallest of the Prussian universities. Also, the mathematical institute was small; in the summer semester 1916 and winter semester 1916/17 Hausdorff was the only mathematician in Greifswald. This brought with it that he was almost fully occupied in teaching the basic courses. It was a substantial improvement of his academic situation when Hausdorff was appointed in 1921 to Bonn. Here he could develop a thematically wide-spanned teaching and always lecture on the latest research. He gave a particularly noteworthy lecture on probability theory (NL Hausdorff: Capsule 21: Fasz 64) in the summer semester 1923, in which he grounded this theory in measure-theoretic axiomatic theory, and this occurred ten years before A. N. Kolmogorov's \"Basic concepts of probability theory\" (reprinted in full in the collected works, Volume V). In Bonn, Hausdorff had Eduard Study, and later with Otto Toeplitz, outstanding mathematicians as well as colleagues and friends.\nUnder the Nazi dictatorship and suicide.\nThe National Socialist party's state doctrine established anti-Semitism and the seizure of power. Hausdorff was not initially concerned by the \"Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\", adopted in 1933, because he had been a German official since before 1914. However, he was not completely spared, as one of his lectures was interrupted by Nazi students. He stopped his 1934/1935 winter semester Calculus III course from 20 November on. During that time, there was a working session of the National Socialist German Student Union (NSDStB) at the University of Bonn, which chose \"Race and Ethnicity\" as their theme for the semester. The assumption is that this event is related to the cancellation of Hausdorff's class, because otherwise he never, in his long career as a university teacher, stopped a class.\nOn March 31, 1935, after some going back and forth, Hausdorff was finally given emeritus status. No words of thanks were given for 40 years of successful work in the German higher education system. He worked tirelessly and published, in addition to the expanded edition of his work on set theory, seven works on topology and descriptive set theory, all published in Polish magazines: one in \"Studia Mathematica\", the others in \"Fundamenta Mathematicae\".\nHis Nachlass shows that Hausdorff was still working mathematically during these increasingly difficult times and following current developments of interest. He was selflessly supported at this time by Erich Bessel-Hagen, a loyal friend to the Hausdorff family who obtained books and magazines from the Library of the institute, which Hausdorff was no longer allowed to enter as a Jew.\nAbout the humiliations to which Hausdorff and his family especially were exposed to after Kristallnacht in 1938, much is known and from many different sources, such as from the letters of Bessel-Hagen.\nIn vain, Hausdorff asked the mathematician Richard Courant in 1939 for a research fellowship to be able to emigrate into the USA.\nIn mid-1941, the Bonn Jews began to be deported to the Monastery \"To Perpetual Adoration\" in Endenich, from which the nuns had been expelled. The transports to the death camps in the east occurred later. After Hausdorff, his wife and his wife's sister, Edith Pappenheim (who was living with them) were ordered in January 1942 to move to the Endenich camp, they committed suicide on 26 January 1942 by taking an overdose of veronal. Their final resting place is located on the Poppelsdorfer cemetery in Bonn. Between their placement in temporary camps and his suicide, he gave his handwritten \"Nachlass\" to the Egyptologist and presbyter Hans Bonnet, who saved as much of them as possible, despite the destruction of his house by a bomb.\nSome of his fellow Jews may have had illusions about the camp Endenich, but not Hausdorff. E. Neuenschwander discovered in the estate of Bessel-Hagen the farewell letter that Hausdorff wrote to his Jewish lawyer Hans Wollstein. Here is the beginning and end of the letter:\nAfter thanking friends and, in great composure, expressing his last wishes regarding his funeral and his will, Hausdorff writes:\nUnfortunately, this desire was not fulfilled. Hausdorff's lawyer Wollstein was murdered in Auschwitz.\nHausdorff's library was sold by his son-in-law and sole heir, Arthur K\u00f6nig. The handwritten \"Nachlass\" was adopted by a family friend, the Bonn Egyptologist Hans Bonnet, for storage. It is now in the University and State Library of Bonn. The \"Nachlass\" is catalogued.\nWork and reception.\nHausdorff as philosopher and writer (Paul Mongr\u00e9).\nHausdorff's volume of aphorisms, published in 1897, was his first work published under the pseudonym Paul Mongr\u00e9. It is entitled \"Sant' Ilario. Thoughts from the landscape of Zarathustra\". The subtitle of \"Sant 'Ilario,\" \"Thoughts from the landscape of Zarathustra,\" plays first on the fact that Hausdorff had completed his book during a recovery stay on the Ligurian coast by Genoa and that in this same area, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote the first two parts of Thus Spoke Zarathustra; he also alludes to his spiritual closeness to Nietzsche. In an article on Sant 'Ilario in the weekly paper Die Zukunft, Hausdorff acknowledged in his debt to Nietzsche.\nHausdorff was not trying to copy or even exceed Nietzsche. \"Of Nietzsche imitation no trace\", says a contemporary review. He follows Nietzsche in an attempt to liberate individual thinking, to take the liberty of questioning outdated standards. Hausdorff maintained critical distance to the late works of Nietzsche. In his essay on the book \"The Will to Power\" compiled from notes left in the Nietzsche Archive he says:\nHis critical standard he took from Nietzsche himself,\nIn 1898 appeared\u2014also under the pseudonym Paul Mongr\u00e9\u2014Hausdorff's epistemological experiment \"Chaos in cosmic selection\". The critique of metaphysics put forward in this book had its starting point in Hausdorff's confrontation with Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence. It ultimately gets to destroying any kind of metaphysics. Of the world itself, from the transcendent world core\u2014as Hausdorff expressed\u2014we know nothing and we know nothing. We must assume \"the world itself\" as undetermined and undeterminable, as a mere chaos. The world of our experience, our cosmos is the result of the selection, the selection that we have always instinctively made according to our possibilities of understanding and make more. From that chaos would also be seen other orders, other Kosmoi, conceivably. At any rate, from the world of our cosmos you can not conclude the existence of a transcendent world.\nIn 1904, in the magazine The New Rundschau, Hausdorff's play appeared, the one-act play \"The doctor in his honor\". It is a crude satire on the duel and on the traditional concepts of honor and nobility of the Prussian officer corps, which in the developing bourgeois society were increasingly anachronistic. \"The doctor in his honor\" was Hausdorff's greatest literary success. In 1914\u20131918 there were numerous performances in more than thirty cities. Hausdorff later wrote an epilogue to the play, but it was not performed at that time. Only in 2006 did this epilogue have its premier at the annual meeting of the German Mathematical Society in Bonn.\nBesides the works above mentioned Hausdorff wrote numerous essays that appeared in some of the leading literary magazines of the time, as well as a book of poems, \"Ecstasy\" (1900). Some of his poems were set to music by Austrian composer Joseph Marx.\nTheory of ordered sets.\nHausdorff's entry into a thorough study of ordered sets was prompted in part by Cantor's continuum problem: which place does the cardinal number formula_1 take in the series formula_2. In a letter to Hilbert on 29 September 1904, he speaks of this problem, \"it has plagued almost like a monomania\". He saw in the set formula_3 a new strategy to attack the problem. Cantor had suspected formula_4, but had only shown formula_5. formula_6 is the \"number\" of possible well-orderings of a countable set ; formula_7 had now emerged as the \"number\" of all possible orders of such an amount. It was natural, therefore, to study systems that are more special than general orders, but more general than well-orderings. Hausdorff did just that in his first volume of 1901 with the publication of theoretical studies of \"graded sets\". We know from the results of Kurt G\u00f6del and Paul Cohen, that this strategy to solve the continuum problem is just as ineffectual as Cantor's strategy, which was aimed at generalizing the Cantor\u2013Bendixson principle for closed sets to general uncountable sets.\nIn 1904 Hausdorff published the recursion named after him:\nFor each non-limit ordinal formula_8 we have formula_9\nThis formula was, together with the later notion of cofinality introduced by Hausdorff, the basis for all further results for Aleph exponentiation. Hausdorff' excellent knowledge of the problems of this type of sequence was also empowered by his efforts to uncover the error in Julius K\u00f6nig's lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1904 in Heidelberg. There K\u00f6nig had argued that the continuum cannot be well-ordered, so its cardinality is no Aleph, and thus caused a great stir. The assertion that it was Hausdorff who clarified the mistake has a special weight because a false image was drawn in the historical literature for more than 50 years of the events in Heidelberg.\nIn the years 1906\u20131909 Hausdorff did his fundamental work on ordered sets. Only a few points can be touched briefly. Of fundamental importance to the whole theory is the concept of cofinality that Hausdorff introduced. An ordinal is called regular if it is cofinal with any smaller ordinal; otherwise it is singular. Hausdorff's question whether there are regular numbers with index a limit ordinal, was the starting point for the theory of inaccessible cardinals. Hausdorff had already noticed that such numbers, if they exist, must be of \"exorbitant size\".\nOf fundamental importance is the following theorem of Hausdorff: for each unbounded ordered dense set formula_10 there are two uniquely determined regular initial numbers formula_11 so that formula_10 is cofinal with formula_13 and coinitial with formula_14 (* Denotes the inverse order). This theorem provides, for example, a technique to characterize elements and gaps in ordered sets. Thus Hausdorff utilized the gap characters and element characters introduced by him.\nIf formula_15 is a predetermined set of characters (element and gap characters), the question arises whether there are ordered sets whose character set is exactly formula_15. One can easily find a necessary condition for formula_15. Hausdorff was able to show that this condition is also sufficient. For this one needs a rich reservoir of ordered sets; Hausdorff had created this with his theory of general products and powers. In this reservoir such interesting structures are found as the Hausdorff formula_18 normal-types, in connection with which Hausdorff first formulated the generalized continuum hypothesis. Hausdorff's formula_18-sets formed the starting point for the study of the important model theory of saturated structure.\nHausdorff's general products and powers of cardinalities had led him to the concept of partially ordered set. The question of whether any ordered subset of a partially ordered set is contained in a maximal ordered subset was answered in the positive by Hausdorff using the well-ordering theorem. This is the Hausdorff maximal principle. It follows not only from the well-ordering theorem (or from the (equivalent to this) axiom of choice), but it is, as it turned out, even to the axiom of choice are equivalent.\nAlready, in 1908, Arthur Moritz Schoenflies found in the second part of his report on set theory, that the newer theory of ordered sets (i.e., that which occurred after Cantor's extensions thereof) was almost exclusively due to Hausdorff.\nThe \"Magnum Opus\": \"Principles of set theory\".\nAccording to former notions, set theory included not only the general set theory and the theory of sets of points, but also dimension and measure theory. Hausdorff's work was the first textbook which presented all of set theory in this broad sense, systematically and with full proofs. Hausdorff was aware of how easily the human mind can err while also seeking for rigor and truth. So he proposed in the preface of the work:\nThis book went far beyond its masterful portrayal of the known. It also contained a series of important original contributions of the author that can only be hinted at in the following.\nThe first six chapters deal with the basic concepts of the general set theory. At the beginning Hausdorff sets forth a detailed set algebra with some pioneering new concepts (differences chains, set rings and set fields, formula_20- and formula_21-systems). These introductory paragraphs on sets and their connections included, for example, the modern set-theoretic notion of functions. Next followed in Chapters 3 to 5 the classical theory of cardinal numbers, order types and ordinals. In the sixth chapter \"Relations between ordered and well-ordered sets\" Hausdorff presents, among other things, the most important results of his own research on ordered sets.\nIn the chapters on \"point sets\"\u2014the topological chapters\u2014Hausdorff developed for the first time, based on the known neighborhood axioms, a systematic theory of topological spaces, where in addition he added the separation axiom later named after him. This theory emerges from a comprehensive synthesis of earlier approaches of other mathematicians and Hausdorff's own reflections on the problem of space. The concepts and theorems of classical point set theory formula_22 are\u2014as far as possible\u2014transferred to the general case, and thus become part of the newly created general or set-theoretic topology. But Hausdorff not only performed this \"translation work\", but he developed also basic construction method of topology as nucleation (interior, dense-in-itself core) and shell formation (closure), and he works the fundamental importance of the concept of open set (called \"area\" by him) and of the compactness introduced by Fr\u00e9chet. He also founded and developed the theory of the connected set, particularly through the introduction of the terms \"component\" and \"quasi-component\".\nBy the first and eventually the second Hausdorff countability axioms the considered spaces were gradually further specialized. A large class of spaces satisfying the countable first axiom are metric spaces. They were introduced in 1906 by Fr\u00e9chet under the name \"classes (E)\". The term \"metric space\" comes from Hausdorff. In \"Principles\", he developed the theory of metric spaces and systematically enriched it through a series of new concepts: Hausdorff metric, complete, total boundedness, formula_23-connectivity, reducible sets. Fr\u00e9chet's work had been little noticed; only through Hausdorff's \"Principles\" did metric spaces become the common property of the mathematician.\nThe chapter on illustrations and the final chapter of \"Principles\" on measure and integration theory are enriched by the generality of the material and the originality of presentation. Hausdorff's mention of the importance of measure theory for probability had great historical effect, despite its laconic brevity. One finds in this chapter the first correct proof of the strong law of large numbers of \u00c9mile Borel. Finally, the appendix contains the single most spectacular result of the whole book, namely Hausdorff's theorem that one cannot define a volume for all bounded subsets of formula_22 for formula_25. The proof is based on Hausdorff's paradoxical ball decomposition, whose production requires the axiom of choice.\nDuring the 20th century, it became the standard to build mathematical theories on axiomatic set theory. The creation of axiomatically founded generalized theories, such as the general topology, served among other things to single out the common structural core for various specific cases or regions and then set up an abstract theory, which contained all these parts as special cases. This brought a great success in the form of simplification and harmonization and ultimately brought on economy of thought with itself. Hausdorff himself highlighted this aspect in the \"Principles\". The topological chapter the basic concepts are methodologically a pioneering effort, and they showed the way for the development of modern mathematics.\n\"Principles of set theory\" appeared in an already tense time on the eve of the First World War. In August 1914, the war, which also dramatically affected the scientific life in Europe. Under these circumstances, could hardly be effective Hausdorff's book in the first five to six years after its appearance. After the war, a new generation of young researchers set forth to expand on the suggestions that were included in this work in such abundance, and with no doubt, the topology was the focus of attention. The journal \"Fundamenta Mathematicae\" played a special role in the reception of Hausdorff's ideas, founded in Poland in 1920. It was one of the first mathematical journals with special emphasis on set theory, topology, theory of real functions, measure and integration theory, functional analysis, logic and foundations of mathematics. In this spectrum, a special focus was the general topology. Hausdorff's \"Principles\" were present in Fundamenta Mathematicae from the first volume in a remarkable frequency. Of the 558 works (Hausdorff's own three works not calculated), which appeared in the first twenty volumes from 1920 to 1933, 88 cite \"Principles\". One even has to take into account that as Hausdorff's conceptions increasingly became commonplace, so they were also used in a number of works that did not mention them explicitly.\nThe Russian topological school, founded by Paul Alexandroff and Paul Urysohn, was based heavily on Hausdorff's \"Principles\". This is shown by the surviving correspondence in Hausdorff's Nachlass with Urysohn, and especially Alexandroff and Urysohn's \"M\u00e9moire sur les multiplicit\u00e9s Cantoriennes\", a work the size of a book, in which Urysohn developed dimension theory and \"Principles\" is cited no fewer than 60 times.\nLong after the Second World War there was a strong demand for Hausdorff's book, and there were three reprints at Chelsea from 1949, 1965 and 1978.\nDescriptive set theory, measure theory and analysis.\nIn 1916, Alexandroff and Hausdorff independently solved the continuum problem for Borel sets: Every Borel set in a complete separable metric space is either countable or has the cardinality of the continuum. This result generalizes the Cantor\u2013Bendixson theorem that such a statement holds for the closed sets of formula_22. For linear formula_27 sets William Henry Young had proved the result in 1903, for formula_28 sets Hausdorff obtained a corresponding result in 1914 in the \"Principles\". The theorem of Alexandroff and Hausdorff was a strong impetus for further development of descriptive set theory.\nAmong the publications of Hausdorff in his time at Greifswald time the work \"Dimension and outer measure\" from 1919 is particularly outstanding. It has remained highly topical and in later years has been probably the most cited mathematical original work from the decade from 1910 to 1920. In this work, the concepts were introduced which are now known as Hausdorff measure and the Hausdorff dimension.\nThe concept of Hausdorff dimension is useful for the characterization and comparison of \"highly rugged quantities\". The concepts of \"Dimension and outer measure\" have experienced applications and further developments in many areas such as in the theory of dynamical systems, geometric measure theory, the theory of self-similar sets and fractals, the theory of stochastic processes, harmonic analysis, potential theory and number theory.\nSignificant analytical work of Hausdorff occurred in his second time at Bonn. In \"Summation methods and moment sequences I\" in 1921, he developed a whole class of summation methods for divergent series, which today are called Hausdorff methods. In Hardy's classic \"Divergent Series\", an entire chapter is devoted to the Hausdorff method. The classical methods of H\u00f6lder and Ces\u00e0ro proved to be special Hausdorff method. Every Hausdorff method is given by a moment sequence; in this context Hausdorff gave an elegant solution of the moment problem for a finite interval, bypassing the theory of continued fractions. In \"Moment problems for a finite interval\" of 1923 he treated more special moment problems, such as those with certain restrictions for generating density formula_29, for instance formula_30. Criteria for solvability and determination of moment problems occupied Hausdorff for many years as hundreds of pages of studies in his Nachlass attest.\nA significant contribution to the emerging functional analysis in the twenties was Hausdorff's extension of the Riesz-Fischer theorem toformula_31 spaces in his 1923 work \"An extension of Parseval's theorem on Fourier series\". He proved the inequalities now named after him and W.H. Young. The Hausdorff\u2013Young inequalities became the starting point of major new developments.\nHausdorff's book \"Set Theory\" appeared in 1927. This was declared as a second Edition of \"Principles\", but it was actually a completely new book. Since the scale was significantly reduced due to its appearance in Goschen's teaching library, large parts of the theory of ordered sets and measures and integration theory were removed. \"More than these deletions, the reader will perhaps regret\" (said Hausdorff in the preface), \"that I, to further save space in point set theory, have abandoned the topological point of view through which the first edition has apparently acquired many friends have limited myself to the easier theory of metric spaces\".\nIn fact, this was an explicit regret of some reviewers of the work. As a kind of compensation Hausdorff showed for the first time the then current state of descriptive set theory. This fact assured the book almost as intense a reception as \"Principles\", especially in Fundamenta Mathematicae. As a textbook it was very popular. In 1935 there was an expanded edition published, and this was reprinted by Dover in 1944. An English translation appeared in 1957 with reprints in 1962 and 1967.\nThere was also a Russian edition (1937), although it was only partially a faithful translation, and partly a reworking by Alexandroff and Kolmogorov. In this translation the topological point of view again moved to the forefront. In 1928 a review of \"Set Theory\" appeared from the pen of Hans Hahn. Perhaps Hahn had the danger of German anti-Semitism in his mind as he closed this discussion with the following sentence:\nThe last works.\nIn his last work Erweiterung einer stetigen Abbildung, Hausdorff showed in 1938 that a continuous function from a closed subset formula_32 of a metric space formula_33 can be extended to all of formula_33 (although the image may need to be extended). As a special case, every homeomorphism from formula_32 can be extended to a homeomorphism from formula_33. This work set forth results from earlier years. In 1919, in \u00dcber halbstetige Funktionen und deren Verallgemeinerung, Hausdorff had, among other things, given another proof of the Tietze extension theorem. In 1930, in \"Erweiterung einer Hom\u00f6omorphie\" (Extending a Homeomorphism), he showed the following: Let formula_33 be a metric space, formula_38 a closed subset. If formula_32 is given a new metric without changing the topology, this metric can be extended to the entire space without changing the topology. The work \"Gestufte R\u00e4ume\" appeared in 1935. Here Hausdorff discussed spaces which fulfilled the Kuratowski closure axioms up to just the axiom of idempotence. He named them \"graded spaces\" (often also called closure spaces) and used them in the study of the relationships between the Fr\u00e9chet limit spaces and topological spaces.\nHausdorff as name-giver.\nThe name Hausdorff is found throughout mathematics. Among others, these concepts were named after him:\nIn the universities of Bonn and Greifswald, these things were named in his honor:\nBesides these, in Bonn there is the Hausdorffstra\u00dfe (Hausdorff Street), where he first lived. (Haus-Nr.\u00a061). In Greifswald there is a Felix-Hausdorff\u2013Stra\u00dfe, where the Institutes for Biochemistry and Physics are located, among others. Since 2011, there is a \"Hausdorffweg\" (Hausdorff-Way) in the middle of Leipziger Ortsteil Gohlis.\nThe Asteroid 24947 Hausdorff was named after him.\nWritings.\nAs Paul Mongr\u00e9.\nOnly a selection of the essays that appeared in text are shown here.\nAs Felix Hausdorff.\n\"Hausdorff on Ordered Sets\".

{"id": "10990", "revid": "1004867284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10990", "title": "Fimbulwinter", "text": "In Norse mythology, Fimbulvetr (or \"fimbulvinter\"), commonly rendered in English as Fimbulwinter, is the immediate prelude to the events of Ragnar\u00f6k. It means \"great winter\". In Old English it is pronounced as \"Fifelwinter\".\nSummary.\nFimbulwinter is the harsh winter that precedes the end of the world and puts an end to all life on Earth. Fimbulwinter is three successive winters, when snow comes in from all directions, without any intervening summer. Innumerable wars follow.\nThe event is described primarily in the \"Poetic Edda\". In the poem \"Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l\", Odin poses the question to Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir as to who of mankind will survive the Fimbulwinter. Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir responds that L\u00edf and L\u00edf\u00ferasir will survive and that they will live in the forest of Hoddm\u00edmis holt. \nThe mythology might be related to the extreme weather events of 535\u2013536, which resulted in a notable drop in temperature across northern Europe. There have also been several popular ideas about whether the particular piece of mythology has a connection to the climate change that occurred in the Nordic countries at the end of the Nordic Bronze Age from about 650 BC. \nIn Denmark, Norway, Sweden and other Nordic countries, the term \"fimbulvinter\" is still used to refer to an unusually cold and harsh winter. However in Sweden, another common word is \"vargavinter\" (\"wolf winter\").\nEtymology.\nFimbulvetr comes from Old Norse, meaning \"awful, great winter.\" The prefix \"fimbul\" means \"the great/big\" so the correct interpretation of the word is \"the great winter.\""}

Its 763,380 inhabitants as of December 31, 2019 make it the fifth-most populous city in Germany. On the River Main (a tributary of the Rhine), it forms a continuous conurbation with the neighboring city of Offenbach am Main and its urban area has a population of 2.3\u00a0million. The city is the heart of the larger Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.5\u00a0million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr Region. Frankfurt's central business district lies about northwest of the geographic center of the EU at Gadheim, Lower Franconia. Like France and Franconia, the city is named after the Franks. Frankfurt is the largest city in the Rhine Franconian dialect area.\nFrankfurt was a city state, the Free City of Frankfurt, for nearly five centuries, and was one of the most important cities of the Holy Roman Empire, as a site of imperial coronations; it lost its sovereignty upon the collapse of the empire in 1806, regained it in 1815 and then lost it again in 1866, when it was annexed (though neutral) by the Kingdom of Prussia. It has been part of the state of Hesse since 1945. Frankfurt is culturally, ethnically and religiously diverse, with half of its population, and a majority of its young people, having a migrant background. A quarter of the population consists of foreign nationals, including many expatriates.\nFrankfurt is a global hub for commerce, culture, education, tourism and transportation, and rated as an \"alpha world city\" according to GaWC. It is the site of many global and European corporate headquarters. Frankfurt Airport is Germany's busiest. Frankfurt is one of the major financial centers of the European continent, with the headquarters of the European Central Bank, Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank, KfW, Commerzbank, several cloud and fintech startups and other institutes. Automotive, technology and research, services, consulting, media and creative industries complement the economic base. Frankfurt's DE-CIX is the world's largest internet exchange point. Messe Frankfurt is one of the world's largest trade fairs. Major fairs include the Music Fair and the Frankfurt Book Fair, the world's largest book fair.\nFrankfurt is home to influential educational institutions, including the Goethe University, the UAS, the FUMPA and graduate schools like the Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management. Its renowned cultural venues include the concert hall Alte Oper, Europe's largest English theatre and many museums (e.g. the Museumsufer ensemble with St\u00e4del and Liebieghaus, Senckenberg Natural Museum, Goethe House and the Schirn art venue at the old town). Frankfurt's skyline is shaped by some of Europe's tallest skyscrapers. The city is also characterised by various green areas and parks, including the central Wallanlagen, the City Forest, two major botanical gardens (the Palmengarten and the University's Botanical Garden) and the Frankfurt Zoo. In sports, the city is known as the home of the top-tier football club Eintracht Frankfurt, the L\u00f6wen Frankfurt ice hockey team, the basketball club Frankfurt Skyliners, the Frankfurt Marathon and the venue of Ironman Germany. It was also one of the host cities of the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.\nDistinctions.\nFrankfurt is the largest financial centre in continental Europe. It is home to the European Central Bank, Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt Stock Exchange and several large commercial banks.\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange is one of the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and accounts for more than 90 percent of the turnover in the German market.\nIn 2010, 63 national and 152 international banks had their registered offices in Frankfurt, including Germany's major banks, notably Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank, KfW and Commerzbank, as well as 41 representative offices of international banks.\nFrankfurt is considered a global city (alpha world city) as listed by the GaWC group's 2012 inventory. Among global cities it was ranked 10th by the Global Power City Index 2011 and 11th by the Global City Competitiveness Index 2012. Among financial centres it was ranked 8th by the International Financial Centers Development Index 2013 and 9th in the 2013 Global Financial Centres Index.\nIts central location within Germany and Europe makes Frankfurt a major air, rail and road transport hub. Frankfurt Airport is one of the world's busiest international airports by passenger traffic and the main hub for Germany's flag carrier Lufthansa. Frankfurt Central Station is one of the largest rail stations in Europe and the busiest junction operated by Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company, with 342 trains a day to domestic and European destinations. Frankfurter Kreuz, the Autobahn interchange close to the airport, is the most heavily used interchange in the EU, used by 320,000 cars daily. In 2011 human-resource-consulting firm Mercer ranked Frankfurt as seventh in its annual 'Quality of Living' survey of cities around the world. According to \"The Economist\" cost-of-living survey, Frankfurt is Germany's most expensive city and the world's 10th most expensive.\nFrankfurt has many high-rise buildings in the city centre, forming the Frankfurt skyline. It is one of the few cities in the European Union (EU) to have such a skyline, which is why Germans sometimes refer to Frankfurt as Mainhattan, combining the local Main River and \"Manhattan\". The other well-known nickname is Bankfurt. Before World War II the city was noted for its unique old town, the largest timber-framed old town in Europe. The R\u00f6mer area was later rebuilt and is popular with visitors and for events such as Christmas markets. Other parts of the old town were reconstructed as part of the Dom-R\u00f6mer Project from 2012 to 2018.\nEtymology.\n\"Frankonovurd\" (in Old High German) or \"Vadum Francorum\" (in Latin) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to \"Frankenfort\" during the Middle Ages and then to \"Franckfort\" and \"Franckfurth\" in the modern era. According to historian David Gans, the city was named 146 AD by its builder, a Frankish king named Zuna, who ruled over the province then known as Sicambri. He hoped thereby to perpetuate the name of his lineage. The name is derived from the \"Franconofurd\" of the Germanic tribe of the Franks; \"Furt\" (cf. English \"ford\") where the river was shallow enough to be crossed on foot.\nBy the 19th century, the name \"Frankfurt\" had been established as the official spelling. The older English spelling of \"Frankfort\" is now rarely seen in reference to Frankfurt am Main, although more than a dozen other towns and cities, mainly in the United States, use this spelling (e.g., Frankfort, Kentucky; Frankfort, New York; Frankfort, Illinois).\nThe suffix \"am Main\" has been used regularly since the 14th century. In English, the city's full name of \"Frankfurt am Main\" means \"Frankfurt on the Main\" (pronounced like English \"mine\" or German \"mein\"). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: \"\") on the Main River. As a part of early Franconia, the inhabitants were the early Franks, thus the city's name reveals its legacy as \"the ford of the Franks on the Main\".\nAmong English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, but Germans occasionally call it by its full name to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city of Frankfurt an der Oder in the \"Land\" of Brandenburg on the Polish border.\nThe city district Bonames has a name probably dating back to Roman times, thought to be derived from \"\" (good table).\nThe common abbreviations for the city, primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are \"Frankfurt (Main)\", \"Frankfurt (M)\", \"Frankfurt a. M.\", \"Frankfurt/Main\" or \"Frankfurt/M\". The common abbreviation for the name of the city is \"FFM\". Also in use is \"FRA\", the IATA code for Frankfurt Airport.\nHistory.\nEarly history and Holy Roman Empire.\nRoman settlements were established in the area of the \"R\u00f6mer\", probably in the first century. \"Nida\" (Heddernheim) was also a Roman civitas capital.\nAlemanni and Franks lived there, and by 794, Charlemagne presided over an imperial assembly and church synod, at which \"Franconofurd\" (alternative spellings end with -furt and -) was first mentioned.\nFrankfurt was one of the most important cities in the Holy Roman Empire. From 855, the German kings and emperors were elected and crowned in Aachen. From 1562, the kings and emperors were crowned in Frankfurt, initiated for Maximilian II. This tradition ended in 1792, when Franz II was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on Bastille Day, 14 July, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. The elections and coronations took place in St. Bartholom\u00e4us Cathedral, known as the \"Kaiserdom\" (Emperor's Cathedral), or its predecessors.\nThe \"Frankfurter Messe\" (Frankfurt Trade Fair) was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, Emperor Friedrich II granted an imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380. Book trade fairs began in 1478.\nIn 1372, Frankfurt became a \"Reichsstadt\" (Imperial Free City), i.e., directly subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.\nIn 1585, Frankfurt traders established a system of exchange rates for the various currencies that were circulating to prevent cheating and extortion. Therein lay the early roots for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\nFrankfurt managed to remain neutral during the Thirty Years' War, but suffered from the bubonic plague that refugees brought to the city. After the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth. In the late 1770s the theatre principal Abel Seyler was based in Frankfurt, and established the city's theatrical life.\nImpact of French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.\nFollowing the French Revolution, Frankfurt was occupied or bombarded several times by French troops. It remained a free city until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806, it became part of the principality of Aschaffenburg under the \"F\u00fcrstprimas\" (Prince-Primate), Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg. This meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the confederation of the Rhine. In 1810, Dalberg adopted the title of a Grand Duke of Frankfurt. Napoleon intended to make his adopted son Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, already \"Prince de Venise\" (\"prince of Venice\", a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg's death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813, when the military tide turned in favour of the Anglo-Prussian led allies that overturned the Napoleonic order. Dalberg abdicated in favour of Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never ruled after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt's takeover by the allies.\nFrankfurt as a fully sovereign state.\nAfter Napoleon's final defeat and abdication, the Congress of Vienna (1814\u20131815) dissolved the grand-duchy and Frankfurt became a fully sovereign city state with a republican form of government. Frankfurt entered the newly founded German Confederation (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its \"Bundestag\", the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding Habsburg Emperor of Austria was represented by an Austrian \"presidential envoy\".\nAfter the ill-fated revolution of 1848, Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament, which met in the Frankfurter Paulskirche (St. Paul's Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. The institution failed in 1849 when the Prussian king, Frederick William IV, declared that he would not accept \"a crown from the gutter\". In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch.\nFrankfurt after the loss of sovereignty.\nFrankfurt lost its independence after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 when Prussia annexed several smaller states, among them the Free City of Frankfurt. The Prussian administration incorporated Frankfurt into its province of Hesse-Nassau. The Prussian occupation and annexation was perceived as a great injustice in Frankfurt, which retained its distinct western European, urban and cosmopolitan character. The formerly independent towns of Bornheim and Bockenheim were incorporated in 1890.\nIn 1914, the citizens founded the University of Frankfurt, later named Goethe University Frankfurt. This marked the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany's largest.\nFrom 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the Ruhr uprising, Frankfurt was occupied by French troops. The French claimed that Articles 42 to 44 of the peace treaty of Versailles concerning the demilitarisation of the Rhineland had been broken. In 1924, Ludwig Landmann became the first Jewish mayor of the city, and led a significant expansion during the following years. During the Nazi era, the synagogues of the city were destroyed.\nFrankfurt was severely bombed in World War II (1939\u20131945). About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once-famous medieval city centre, by that time the largest in Germany, was almost completely destroyed. It became a ground battlefield on 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The 5th Infantry Division and the 6th Armored Division of the United States Army captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945.\nAfter the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old Hesse-(Darmstadt) and the Prussian Hesse provinces. The city was part of the American Zone of Occupation of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945\u20131949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949\u20131952) had their headquarters in the IG Farben Building, intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment.\nFrankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital city of the newly founded state of West Germany in 1949. The city constructed a parliament building that was never used for its intended purpose (it housed the radio studios of Hessischer Rundfunk). In the end, Konrad Adenauer, the first postwar Chancellor, preferred the town of Bonn, for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also because many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt would be accepted as the permanent capital, thereby weakening the West German population's support for a reunification with East Germany and the eventual return of the capital to Berlin.\nPostwar reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus changing Frankfurt's architectural face. A few landmark buildings were reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner (e.g., R\u00f6mer, St. Paul's Church, and Goethe House). The collection of historically significant Cairo Genizah documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed by the bombing. According to Arabist and Genizah scholar S.D. Goitein, \"not even handlists indicating its contents have survived.\"\nThe end of the war marked Frankfurt's comeback as Germany's leading financial centre, mainly because Berlin, now a city divided into four sectors, could no longer rival it. In 1948, the allies founded the Bank deutscher L\u00e4nder, the forerunner of Deutsche Bundesbank. Following this decision, more financial institutions were re-established, e.g. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. In the 1950s, Frankfurt Stock Exchange regained its position as the country's leading stock exchange.\nFrankfurt also re-emerged as Germany's transportation centre and Frankfurt Airport became Europe's second-busiest airport behind London Heathrow Airport in 1961.\nDuring the 1970s, the city created one of Europe's most efficient underground transportation systems. That system includes a suburban rail system (S-Bahn) linking outlying communities with the city centre, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches (U-Bahn) also capable of travelling above ground on rails.\nIn 1998, the European Central Bank was founded in Frankfurt, followed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and European Systemic Risk Board in 2011.\nGeography.\nFrankfurt is the largest city in the federated state of Hesse in the south-western part of Germany.\nSite.\nFrankfurt is located on both sides of the Main River, south-east of the Taunus mountain range. The southern part of the city contains the Frankfurt City Forest, Germany's largest city forest. The city area is and extends over east to west and north to south. The city centre is north of the River Main in Altstadt district (the historical centre) and the surrounding Innenstadt district. The geographical centre is in Bockenheim district near Frankfurt West station.\nFrankfurt is the centre of the densely populated Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region with a population of 5.5\u00a0million. Other important cities in the region are Wiesbaden (capital of Hesse), Mainz (capital of Rhineland-Palatinate), Darmstadt, Offenbach am Main, Hanau, Aschaffenburg, Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he, R\u00fcsselsheim, Wetzlar and Marburg.\nDistricts.\nThe city is divided into 46 city districts (\"Stadtteile\"), which are in turn divided into 121 city boroughs (\"Stadtbezirke\") and 448 electoral districts (\"Wahlbezirke\"). The 46 city districts combine into 16 area districts (\"Ortsbezirke\"), which each have a district committee and chairperson.\nThe largest city district by population and area is Sachsenhausen, while the smallest is Altstadt, Frankfurt's historical center. Three larger city districts (Sachsenhausen, Westend and Nordend) are divided for administrative purposes into a northern (\"-Nord\") and a southern (\"-S\u00fcd\") part, respectively a western (\"-West\") and an eastern (\"-Ost\") part, but are generally considered as one city district (which is why often only 43 city districts are mentioned, even on the city's official website).\nSome larger housing areas are often falsely called city districts, even by locals, like Nordweststadt (part of Niederursel, Heddernheim and Praunheim), Goldstein (part of Schwanheim), Riedberg (part of Kalbach-Riedberg) and Europaviertel (part of Gallus). The Bankenviertel (\"banking district\"), Frankfurt's financial district, is also not an administrative city district (it covers parts of the western Innenstadt district, the southern Westend district and the eastern Bahnhofsviertel district).\nMany city districts are incorporated suburbs (\"Vororte\"), or were previously independent cities, such as H\u00f6chst. Some like Nordend and Westend arose during the rapid growth of the city in the Gr\u00fcnderzeit following the Unification of Germany, while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city , such as Dornbusch and Riederwald.\nHistory of incorporations.\nUntil the year 1877 the city's territory consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of Altstadt, Innenstadt, Bahnhofsviertel, Gutleutviertel, Gallus, Westend, Nordend, Ostend and Sachsenhausen.\nBornheim was part of an administrative district called \"Landkreis Frankfurt\", before becoming part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by Bockenheim on 1 April 1895. Seckbach, Niederrad and Oberrad followed on 1 July 1900. The \"Landkreis Frankfurt\" was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore Berkersheim, Bonames, Eckenheim, Eschersheim, Ginnheim, Hausen, Heddernheim, Niederursel, Praunheim, Preungesheim and R\u00f6delheim joined the city. In the same year a new city district, Riederwald, was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.\nOn 1 April 1928 the City of H\u00f6chst became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts Sindlingen, Unterliederbach and Zeilsheim. Simultaneously the \"Landkreis H\u00f6chst\" was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt (Fechenheim, Griesheim, Nied, Schwanheim, Sossenheim) or joining the newly established \"Landkreis\" of Main-Taunus-Kreis.\nDornbusch became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.\nOn 1 August 1972, Hesse's smaller suburbs of Harheim, Kalbach, Nieder-Erlenbach, and Nieder-Eschbach became districts while other neighbouring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the Landkreis Offenbach, the Kreis Gro\u00df-Gerau, the Hochtaunuskreis, the Main-Kinzig-Kreis or the Wetteraukreis.\nBergen-Enkheim was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.\nFlughafen became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport that had belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighbouring city of M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf.\nFrankfurt's youngest city district is Frankfurter Berg. It was part of Bonames until 1996.\nKalbach was officially renamed Kalbach-Riedberg in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area known as Riedberg.\nNeighbouring districts and cities.\nTo the west Frankfurt borders the administrative district (\"Landkreis\") of Main-Taunus-Kreis with towns such as Hattersheim am Main, Kriftel, Hofheim am Taunus, Kelkheim, Liederbach am Taunus, Sulzbach, Schwalbach am Taunus and Eschborn; to the northwest the Hochtaunuskreis with Steinbach, Oberursel (Taunus) and Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he; to the north the Wetteraukreis with Karben and Bad Vilbel; to the northeast the Main-Kinzig-Kreis with Niederdorfelden and Maintal; to the southeast the city of Offenbach am Main; to the south the Kreis Offenbach with Neu-Isenburg and to the southwest the Kreis Gro\u00df-Gerau with M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf, R\u00fcsselsheim and Kelsterbach.\nTogether with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., Hanau, Rodgau, Dreieich, Langen) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called \"Stadtregion Frankfurt\" which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3\u00a0million in 2010, and is the 13th-largest urban area in the EU.\nClimate.\nFrankfurt has a temperate-oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"). Its average annual temperature is , with monthly mean temperatures ranging from in January to in July (Data from between 1981 and 2010) \nDue to its location at the northern tip of the Upper Rhine Valley in the Southwest of Germany, Frankfurt is one of the warmest and driest bigger German cities together with cities like Darmstadt, Mannheim, Karlsruhe and Freiburg im Breisgau. Summers in Frankfurt can get very warm, when compared to the rest of the country. Between the years 1981 and 2010 there have been 52 days in Frankfurt with a maximum temperature over 25 \u00b0C and 13 days with a maximum over 30 \u00b0C on average per year. \nClimate change elevates the numbers of hot days. In the year of 2018, there have been recorded 108 days with a maximum over 25 \u00b0C and 43 days with a maximum over 30 \u00b0C (compared to 52 and 13 days on average per year between 1981 and 2010). The overall tendency for higher temperatures can be seen when comparing the climate data from 1981 to 2010 with the data from 2010 to 2020. It is getting sunnier, drier and warmer.\nBeing an urban heat island, Frankfurt is sometimes affected by tropical nights, where the temperature does not drop under 20\u00b0C between May and September. This occurs because the density of the city causes it to store all the heat. \nThe growing season is longer when compared to the rest of Germany, thus resulting in an early arrival of springtime in the region. \nWinters in Frankfurt are generally mild or at least not freezing with a small possibility of snow, especially in January and February but dark and often overcast. Frankfurt is, on average, covered with snow only for around 10 to 20 days per year. The temperatures fell at about 70 days under 0\u00b0C and daily maximum has stayed under 0\u00b0C for about 13 days on average per year between 1981 and 2010. Some days with lows under -10 \u00b0C can occur more often here than at the coasts of Northern Germany, but not that frequently like in Bavaria or the eastern parts of Germany. \nBecause of the mild climate in the region, there are some well-known wine regions not far away such as Rhenish Hesse, Rheingau, Franconia (wine region) and Bergstra\u00dfe (route). There is also a microclimate on the northern bank of the River Main which is responsible for palms, fig trees, lemon trees and southern European plants growing in that area. The area is called the \"Nizza\" (the German word for the southern French town Nice) and is one of the biggest parks with a Mediterranean vegetation north of the Alps. \nData from Deutscher Wetterdienst "}

His first experience of warfare came in 1849, when he served as a captain in the First War of Schleswig against Denmark.\nWhen the Austro-Prussian War broke out in 1866, Albert, then Crown Prince (German: \"Kronprinz\"), took up the command of the Saxon forces opposing the Prussian Army of Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia. No attempt was made to defend Saxony, and the Saxons fell back into Bohemia and effected a junction with the Austrians. They took a prominent part in the battles by which the Prussians forced the line of the Jizera and in the Battle of Ji\u010d\u00edn. The Crown Prince, however, succeeded in effecting the retreat in good order, and in the decisive Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz (3 July 1866), he held the extreme left of the Austrian position. The Saxons maintained their post with great tenacity but were involved in the disastrous defeat of their allies.\nDuring the operations, the Crown Prince won the reputation of a thorough soldier. After peace was made and Saxony had entered the North German Confederation, he gained the command of the Saxon army, which had now become the XII army corps of the North German army, and in that position, he carried out the necessary reorganisation. He proved a firm adherent of the Prussian alliance. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, he again commanded the Saxons, who were included in the 2nd army under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, his old opponent. At the Battle of Gravelotte, they formed the extreme left of the German army, and with the Prussian Guard carried out the attack on St Privat, the final and decisive action in the battle.\nIn the reorganisation of the army which accompanied the march towards Paris the Crown Prince gained a separate command over the 4th army (Army of the Meuse) consisting of the Saxons, the Prussian Guard corps, and the IV (Prussian Saxony) corps. He was succeeded in command of the XII corps by his brother Prince George, who had served under him in Bohemia.\nAlbert took a leading part in the operations which preceded the battle of Sedan, the 4th army being the pivot on which the whole army wheeled round in pursuit of MacMahon; and the actions of Buzancy and Beaumont on 29 and 30 August 1870 were fought under his direction; in the Battle of Sedan itself (1 September 1870), with the troops under his orders, Albert carried out the envelopment of the French on the east and the north.\nAlbert's conduct in the engagements won for him the complete confidence of the army, and during the Siege of Paris, his troops formed the north-east section of the investing force. During the siege, he blocked French attempts to break out of the encirclement at Le Bourget and Villiers. After the conclusion of the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871), he was left in command of the German army of occupation, a position which he held till the fall of the Paris Commune. On the conclusion of peace, he was made an inspector-general of the army and a field marshal.\nKing.\nOn the death of his father, King John on 29 October 1873, the Crown Prince succeeded to the throne as King Albert. His reign proved uneventful, and he took little public part in politics, devoting himself to military affairs, in which his advice and experience were of the greatest value, not only to the Saxon corps but also to the German army in general. During his reign, the Saxon monarchy became constitutional.\nIn the 1870s, Albert initiated the construction of a Dresden suburb, the Albertstadt. It was then the largest garrison in Germany. Near the former suburb other buildings and places still bear his name: the Albertbr\u00fccke, the Alberthafen, the Albertplatz and the Albertinum.\nIn 1879, he initiated the reconstruction of the Saint Afra School in Meissen. In 1897, he was appointed arbitrator between the claimants for the Principality of Lippe.\nMarriage and succession.\nIn Dresden on 18 June 1853, Albert married Princess Carola, daughter of Gustav, Prince of Vasa and granddaughter of Gustav IV Adolf, the second to last king of Sweden of the House of Holstein-Gottorp. The marriage was childless although Carola miscarried many times. They included:\nAlbert died at Sibyllenort on 19 June 1902 and was succeeded by his brother, who became King George. He was buried in Dresden on 23 June, among the mourners present were both the German Emperor Wilhelm II and the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I.\nHonours, decorations and awards.\nThe King of Saxony bird-of-paradise was named in Albert's honour; the Queen Carola's parotia was named for his wife."}
{"id": "10996", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10996", "title": "Fran\u00e7ois d'Aguilon", "text": "Fran\u00e7ois d'Aguilon (also d'Aguillon or in Latin Franciscus Aguilonius) (4 January 1567 \u2013 20 March 1617) was a Belgian Jesuit mathematician, physicist, and architect.\nD'Aguilon was born in Brussels; his father was a secretary to Philip II of Spain. He became a Jesuit in Tournai in 1586. In 1598 he moved to Antwerp, where he helped plan the construction of the Saint Carolus Borromeus church. In 1611, he started a special school of mathematics in Antwerp, fulfilling a dream of Christopher Clavius for a Jesuit mathematical school; in 1616, he was joined there by Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent. The notable geometers educated at this school included Jean-Charles della Faille, Andr\u00e9 Tacquet, and Theodorus Moretus.\nHis book, \"Opticorum Libri Sex philosophis juxta ac mathematicis utiles,\" or \"Six Books of Optics,\" is useful for philosophers and mathematicians. It was published by Balthasar I Moretus in Antwerp in 1613 and illustrated by the famous painter Peter Paul Rubens. It included one of the first studies of binocular vision. It also gave the names we now use to stereographic projection and orthographic projection, although the projections themselves were likely known to Hipparchus. This book inspired the works of Desargues and Christiaan Huygens.\nHe died in Antwerp, aged 50.\nSix Books Of Optics.\nFrancois d'Aguilon's \"Six Books Of Optics\" concerns geometrical optics, which at the time in the Jesuit school was a subcategory of geometry. He taught logic, syntax, and theology while being charged with organizing the teaching of geometry and science which would be useful for geography, navigation, architecture and the military arts in Belgium. His superiors wanted him to synthesize the work of Euclid, Alhazen, Vitello, Roger Bacon and others. Although he died before completing the book, it still consists of six in-depth books, called \"Opticorum Libri Sex.\"\nPerception and the horopter.\nD'Aguilon extensively studied stereographic projection, which he wanted to use a means to aid architects, cosmographers, navigators and artists. For centuries, artists and architects had sought formal laws of projection to place objects on a screen. Aguilon's \"Opticorum libri sex\" successfully treated projections and the errors in perception. D'Aguillon adopted Alhazen's theory that only light rays orthogonal to the cornea and lens surface are clearly registered. Aguilon was the first to use the term horopter, which is the line drawn through the focal point of both eyes and parallel to the line between the eyes. In other words, it describes how only objects on the horopter are seen in their true location. He then built an instrument to measure the spacing of double images in the horopter as he saw fit.\nD'Aguilon expanded on the horopter by saying in his book: \nAt first glance, it seems that Aguillon discovered the geometrical horopter more than 200 years before Prevost and Vieth and Muller. The horopter was then used by architect Girard Desargues, who in 1639 published a remarkable treatise on the conic sections, emphasizing the idea of projection.\nSimilarity to other theorists.\nIn Aguilon's book there are elements of perspectivities as well as the stereographic projections of Ptolemy and Hipparchus. Unaware that Johannes Kepler had already published optical theories years before him, Aguilon decided to share his insights on geometric optics. At the age of 20, the Dutch poet Constantijn Huygens read Aguilon's and was enthralled by it. He later said that it was the best book he had ever read in geometrical optics, and he thought that Aguilon should be compared to Plato, Eudoxus and Archimedes. In fact the title of Constantijn Huygens' first publication imitated Aguilon's title (omitting letters p and c): Otiorum Libri Sex (1625).\nAccompanying art.\nIn Aguilon's book the beginning of each section had works of the Flemish Baroque painter, Peter Paul Rubens. The frontispiece at the beginning of the book shows an eagle, referring to Aguilon's name and a variety of optical and geometrical images. On either side of the title stands Mercury holding the head of Argus with a hundred eyes, and Minerva holding a shield reflecting the head of Medusa. Then, at the beginning of each of six sections are Rubens' drawings describing Aguilon's experiments, one of which is the first known picture of a photometer This is one of six experiments drawn by Rubens and shows how intensity of light varies with the square of distance from the source. The experiment was later taken up by Mersenne and another Jesuit, Claude de Chales, and eventually led to Bouguer's more famous photometer. It is evident, from the detail that he put into his drawings, how enthused Rubens was about the subject matter, perspective geometry and optical rules."}

It uses a decentralized distributed data store to keep and deliver information, and has a suite of free software for publishing and communicating on the Web without fear of censorship.&lt;ref name=\"Peers in a Client/Server World, 2005\"&gt;Taylor, Ian J. \"From P2P to Web Services and Grids: Peers in a Client/Server World\". London: Springer, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Freenet and some of its associated tools were originally designed by Ian Clarke, who defined Freenet's goal as providing freedom of speech on the Internet with strong anonymity protection.\nThe distributed data store of Freenet is used by many third-party programs and plugins to provide microblogging and media sharing, anonymous and decentralised version tracking, blogging, a generic web of trust for decentralized spam resistance, Shoeshop for using Freenet over Sneakernet, and many more.\nHistory.\nThe origin of Freenet can be traced to Ian Clarke's student project at the University of Edinburgh, which he completed as a graduation requirement in the summer of 1999. Ian Clarke's resulting unpublished report \"A distributed decentralized information storage and retrieval system\" (1999) provided foundation for the seminal paper written in collaboration with other researchers, \"Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System\" (2001). According to CiteSeer, it became one of the most frequently cited computer science articles in 2002.\nResearchers suggested that Freenet can provide anonymity on the Internet by storing small encrypted snippets of content distributed on the computers of its users and connecting only through intermediate computers which pass on requests for content and sending them back without knowing the contents of the full file, similar to how routers on the Internet route packets without knowing anything about files\u2014except Freenet has caching, a layer of strong encryption, and no reliance on centralized structures. This allows users to publish anonymously or retrieve various kinds of information.\nFreenet has been under continuous development since 2000.\nFreenet 0.7, released on 8 May 2008, is a major re-write incorporating a number of fundamental changes. The most fundamental change is support for darknet operation. Version 0.7 offered two modes of operation: a mode in which it connects only to friends, and an opennet-mode in which it connects to any other Freenet user. Both modes can be run simultaneously. When a user switches to pure darknet operation, Freenet becomes very difficult to detect from the outside. The transport layer created for the darknet mode allows communication over restricted routes as commonly found in mesh networks, as long as these connections follow a small-world structure. Other modifications include switching from TCP to UDP, which allows UDP hole punching along with faster transmission of messages between peers in the network.\nFreenet 0.7.5, released on 12 June 2009, offers a variety of improvements over 0.7. These include reduced memory usage, faster insert and retrieval of content, significant improvements to the FProxy web interface used for browsing freesites, and a large number of smaller bugfixes, performance enhancements, and usability improvements. Version 0.7.5 also shipped with a new version of the Windows installer.\nAs of build 1226, released on 30 July 2009, features that have been written include significant security improvements against both attackers acting on the network and physical seizure of the computer running the node.\nAs of build 1468, released on 11 July 2015, the Freenet core stopped using the db4o database and laid the foundation for an efficient interface to the Web of Trust plugin which provides spam resistance.\nFreenet has always been free software, but until 2011 it required users to install Java. This problem was solved by making Freenet compatible with OpenJDK, a free and open source implementation of the Java Platform.\nOn 11 February 2015, Freenet received the SUMA-Award for \"protection against total surveillance.\"\nFeatures and user interface.\nFreenet served as the model for the Japanese peer to peer file-sharing programs Winny, Share and Perfect Dark, but this model differs from p2p networks such as Bittorrent and emule. Freenet separates the underlying network structure and protocol from how users interact with the network; as a result, there are a variety of ways to access content on the Freenet network. The simplest is via FProxy, which is integrated with the node software and provides a web interface to content on the network. Using FProxy, a user can browse freesites (websites that use normal HTML and related tools, but whose content is stored within Freenet rather than on a traditional web server). The web interface is also used for most configuration and node management tasks. Through the use of separate applications or plugins loaded into the node software, users can interact with the network in other ways, such as forums similar to web forums or Usenet or interfaces more similar to traditional P2P \"filesharing\" interfaces.\nWhile Freenet provides an HTTP interface for browsing freesites, it is not a proxy for the World Wide Web; Freenet can be used to access only the content that has been previously inserted into the Freenet network. In this way, it is more similar to Tor's hidden services than to anonymous proxy software like Tor's proxy.\nFreenet's focus lies on free speech and anonymity. Because of that, Freenet acts differently at certain points that are (directly or indirectly) related to the anonymity part. Freenet attempts to protect the anonymity of both people inserting data into the network (uploading) and those retrieving data from the network (downloading). Unlike file sharing systems, there is no need for the uploader to remain on the network after uploading a file or group of files. Instead, during the upload process, the files are broken into chunks and stored on a variety of other computers on the network. When downloading, those chunks are found and reassembled. Every node on the Freenet network contributes storage space to hold files and bandwidth that it uses to route requests from its peers.\nAs a direct result of the anonymity requirements, the node requesting content does not normally connect directly to the node that has it; instead, the request is routed across several intermediaries, none of which know which node made the request or which one had it. As a result, the total bandwidth required by the network to transfer a file is higher than in other systems, which can result in slower transfers, especially for infrequently accessed content.\nSince version 0.7, Freenet offers two different levels of security: Opennet and Darknet. With Opennet, users connect to arbitrary other users. With Darknet, users connect only to \"friends\" with whom they previously exchanged public keys, named node-references. Both modes can be used together.\nContent.\nFreenet's founders argue that true freedom of speech comes only with true anonymity and that the beneficial uses of Freenet outweigh its negative uses. Their view is that free speech, in itself, is not in contradiction with any other consideration\u2014the information is not the crime. Freenet attempts to remove the possibility of any group imposing its beliefs or values on any data. Although many states censor communications to different extents, they all share one commonality in that a body must decide what information to censor and what information to allow. What may be acceptable to one group of people may be considered offensive or even dangerous to another. In essence, the purpose of Freenet is to ensure that no one is allowed to decide what is acceptable.\nReports of Freenet's use in authoritarian nations is difficult to track due to the very nature of Freenet's goals. One group, \"Freenet China\", used to introduce the Freenet software to Chinese users starting from 2001 and distribute it within China through e-mails and on disks after the group's website was blocked by the Chinese authorities on the mainland. It was reported that in 2002 \"Freenet China\" had several thousand dedicated users. However, Freenet opennet traffic was blocked in China around the 2010s.\nTechnical design.\nThe Freenet file sharing network stores documents and allows them to be retrieved later by an associated key, as is now possible with protocols such as HTTP. The network is designed to be highly survivable. The system has no central servers and is not subject to the control of any one individual or organization, including the designers of Freenet. The codebase size is over 192.000 lines of code. Information stored on Freenet is distributed around the network and stored on several different nodes. Encryption of data and relaying of requests makes it difficult to determine who inserted content into Freenet, who requested that content, or where the content was stored. This protects the anonymity of participants, and also makes it very difficult to censor specific content. Content is stored encrypted, making it difficult for even the operator of a node to determine what is stored on that node. This provides plausible deniability, and in combination with the request relaying means that safe harbor laws that protect service providers may also protect Freenet node operators. When asked about the topic, Freenet developers defer to the EFF discussion which says that not being able to filter anything is a safe choice.\nDistributed storage and caching of data.\nLike Winny, Share and Perfect Dark, Freenet not only transmits data between nodes but actually stores them, working as a huge distributed cache. To achieve this, each node allocates some amount of disk space to store data; this is configurable by the node operator, but is typically several GB (or more).\nFiles on Freenet are typically split into multiple small blocks, with duplicate blocks created to provide redundancy. Each block is handled independently, meaning that a single file may have parts stored on many different nodes.\nInformation flow in Freenet is different from networks like eMule or BitTorrent; in Freenet:\nTwo advantages of this design are high reliability and anonymity. Information remains available even if the publisher node goes offline, and is anonymously spread over many hosting nodes as encrypted blocks, not entire files.\nThe key disadvantage of the storage method is that no one node is responsible for any chunk of data. If a piece of data is not retrieved for some time and a node keeps getting new data, it will drop the old data sometime when its allocated disk space is fully used. In this way Freenet tends to 'forget' data which is not retrieved regularly (see also Effect).\nWhile users can insert data into the network, there is no way to delete data. Due to Freenet's anonymous nature the original publishing node or owner of any piece of data is unknown. The only way data can be removed is if users don't request it.\nNetwork.\nTypically, a host computer on the network runs the software that acts as a node, and it connects to other hosts running that same software to form a large distributed, variable-size network of peer nodes. Some nodes are end user nodes, from which documents are requested and presented to human users. Other nodes serve only to route data. All nodes communicate with each other identically \u2013 there are no dedicated \"clients\" or \"servers\". It is not possible for a node to rate another node except by its capacity to insert and fetch data associated with a key. This is unlike most other P2P networks where node administrators can employ a ratio system, where users have to share a certain amount of content before they can download.\nFreenet may also be considered a small world network.\nThe Freenet protocol is intended to be used on a network of complex topology, such as the Internet (Internet Protocol). Each node knows only about some number of other nodes that it can reach directly (its conceptual \"neighbors\"), but any node can be a neighbor to any other; no hierarchy or other structure is intended. Each message is routed through the network by passing from neighbor to neighbor until it reaches its destination. As each node passes a message to a neighbor, it does not know whether the neighbor will forward the message to another node, or is the final destination or original source of the message. This is intended to protect the anonymity of users and publishers.\nEach node maintains a data store containing documents associated with keys, and a routing table associating nodes with records of their performance in retrieving different keys.\nProtocol.\nThe Freenet protocol uses a key-based routing protocol, similar to distributed hash tables. The routing algorithm changed significantly in version 0.7. Prior to version 0.7, Freenet used a heuristic routing algorithm where each node had no fixed location, and routing was based on which node had served a key closest to the key being fetched (in version 0.3) or which is estimated to serve it faster (in version 0.5). In either case, new connections were sometimes added to downstream nodes (i.e. the node that answered the request) when requests succeeded, and old nodes were discarded in least recently used order (or something close to it). Oskar Sandberg's research (during the development of version 0.7) shows that this \"path folding\" is critical, and that a very simple routing algorithm will suffice provided there is path folding.\nThe disadvantage of this is that it is very easy for an attacker to find Freenet nodes, and connect to them, because every node is continually attempting to find new connections. In version 0.7, Freenet supports both 'Opennet' (similar to the old algorithms, but simpler), and \"Darknet\" (all node connections are set up manually, so only your friends know your node's IP address). Darknet is less convenient, but much more secure against a distant attacker.\nThis change required major changes in the routing algorithm. Every node has a location, which is a number between 0 and 1. When a key is requested, first the node checks the local data store. If it's not found, the key's hash is turned into another number in the same range, and the request is routed to the node whose location is closest to the key. This goes on until some number of hops is exceeded, there are no more nodes to search, or the data is found. If the data is found, it is cached on each node along the path. So there is no one source node for a key, and attempting to find where it is currently stored will result in it being cached more widely. Essentially the same process is used to insert a document into the network: the data is routed according to the key until it runs out of hops, and if no existing document is found with the same key, it is stored on each node. If older data is found, the older data is propagated and returned to the originator, and the insert \"collides\".\nBut this works only if the locations are clustered in the right way. Freenet assumes that the Darknet (a subset of the global social network) is a small-world network, and nodes constantly attempt to swap locations (using the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm) in order to minimize their distance to their neighbors. If the network actually is a small-world network, Freenet should find data reasonably quickly; ideally on the order of formula_1 hops in Big O notation. However, it does not guarantee that data will be found at all.\nEventually, either the document is found or the hop limit is exceeded. The terminal node sends a reply that makes its way back to the originator along the route specified by the intermediate nodes' records of pending requests. The intermediate nodes may choose to cache the document along the way. Besides saving bandwidth, this also makes documents harder to censor as there is no one \"source node.\"\nEffect.\nInitially, the locations in Darknet are distributed randomly. This means that routing of requests is essentially random. In Opennet connections are established by a join request which provides an optimized network structure if the existing network is already optimized. So the data in a newly started Freenet will be distributed somewhat randomly.\nAs location swapping (on Darknet) and path folding (on Opennet) progress, nodes which are close to one another will increasingly have close locations, and nodes which are far away will have distant locations. Data with similar keys will be stored on the same node.\nThe result is that the network will self-organize into a distributed, clustered structure where nodes tend to hold data items that are close together in key space. There will probably be multiple such clusters throughout the network, any given document being replicated numerous times, depending on how much it is used. This is a kind of \"spontaneous symmetry breaking\", in which an initially symmetric state (all nodes being the same, with random initial keys for each other) leads to a highly asymmetric situation, with nodes coming to specialize in data that has closely related keys.\nThere are forces which tend to cause clustering (shared closeness data spreads throughout the network), and forces that tend to break up clusters (local caching of commonly used data). These forces will be different depending on how often data is used, so that seldom-used data will tend to be on just a few nodes which specialize in providing that data, and frequently used items will be spread widely throughout the network. This automatic mirroring counteracts the times when web traffic becomes overloaded, and due to a mature network's intelligent routing, a network of size \"n\" should require only log(\"n\") time to retrieve a document on average.\nKeys.\nKeys are hashes: there is no notion of semantic closeness when speaking of key closeness. Therefore, there will be no correlation between key closeness and similar popularity of data as there might be if keys did exhibit some semantic meaning, thus avoiding bottlenecks caused by popular subjects.\nThere are two main varieties of keys in use on Freenet, the Content Hash Key (CHK) and the Signed Subspace Key (SSK). A subtype of SSKs is the Updatable Subspace Key (USK) which adds versioning to allow secure updating of content.\nA CHK is a SHA-256 hash of a document (after encryption, which itself depends on the hash of the plaintext) and thus a node can check that the document returned is correct by hashing it and checking the digest against the key. This key contains the meat of the data on Freenet. It carries all the binary data building blocks for the content to be delivered to the client for reassembly and decryption. The CHK is unique by nature and provides tamperproof content. A hostile node altering the data under a CHK will immediately be detected by the next node or the client. CHKs also reduce the redundancy of data since the same data will have the same CHK and when multiple sites reference the same large files, they can reference to the same CHK.\nSSKs are based on public-key cryptography. Currently Freenet uses the DSA algorithm. Documents inserted under SSKs are signed by the inserter, and this signature can be verified by every node to ensure that the data is not tampered with. SSKs can be used to establish a verifiable pseudonymous identity on Freenet, and allow for multiple documents to be inserted securely by a single person. Files inserted with an SSK are effectively immutable, since inserting a second file with the same name can cause collisions. USKs resolve this by adding a version number to the keys which is also used for providing update notification for keys registered as bookmarks in the web interface. Another subtype of the SSK is the Keyword Signed Key, or KSK, in which the key pair is generated in a standard way from a simple human-readable string. Inserting a document using a KSK allows the document to be retrieved and decrypted if and only if the requester knows the human-readable string; this allows for more convenient (but less secure) URIs for users to refer to.\nScalability.\nA network is said to be scalable if its performance does not deteriorate even if the network is very large. The scalability of Freenet is being evaluated, but similar architectures have been shown to scale logarithmically. This work indicates that Freenet can find data in formula_2 hops on a small-world network (which includes both opennet and darknet style Freenet networks), when ignoring the caching which could improve the scalability for popular content. However, this scalability is difficult to test without a very large network. Furthermore, the security features inherent to Freenet make detailed performance analysis (including things as simple as determining the size of the network) difficult to do accurately. As of now, the scalability of Freenet has yet to be tested.\nDarknet versus Opennet.\nAs of version 0.7, Freenet supports both \"darknet\" and \"opennet\" connections. Opennet connections are made automatically by nodes with opennet enabled, while darknet connections are manually established between users that know and trust each other. Freenet developers describe the trust needed as \"will not crack their Freenet node\". Opennet connections are easy to use, but darknet connections are more secure against attackers on the network, and can make it difficult for an attacker (such as an oppressive government) to even determine that a user is running Freenet in the first place.\nThe core innovation in Freenet 0.7 is to allow a globally scalable darknet, capable (at least in theory) of supporting millions of users. Previous darknets, such as WASTE, have been limited to relatively small disconnected networks. The scalability of Freenet is made possible by the fact that human relationships tend to form small-world networks, a property that can be exploited to find short paths between any two people. The work is based on a speech given at DEF CON 13 by Ian Clarke and Swedish mathematician Oskar Sandberg. Furthermore, the routing algorithm is capable of routing over a mixture of opennet and darknet connections, allowing people who have only a few friends using the network to get the performance from having sufficient connections while still receiving some of the security benefits of darknet connections. This also means that small darknets where some users also have opennet connections are fully integrated into the whole Freenet network, allowing all users access to all content, whether they run opennet, darknet, or a hybrid of the two, except for darknet pockets connected only by a single hybrid node.\nTools and applications.\nUnlike many other P2P applications Freenet does not provide comprehensive functionality itself. Freenet is modular and features an API called Freenet Client Protocol (FCP) for other programs to use to implement services such as message boards, file sharing, or online chat.\nVulnerabilities.\nLaw enforcement agencies have claimed to have successfully infiltrated freenet opennet in order to deanonymize users but no technical details have been given to support these allegations. One report stated that, \"A child-porn investigation focused on... [the suspect] when the authorities were monitoring the online network, Freenet.\" A different report indicated arrests may have been based on the BlackICE project leaks, that are debunked for using bad math and for using an incorrectly calculated false positives rate and a false model.\nA court case in the Peel Region of Ontario, Canada R. v. Owen, 2017 ONCJ 729 (CanLII), illustrated that Law Enforcement do in fact have a presence, after Peel Regional Police located who had been downloading illegal material on the Freenet network. The court decision indicates that a Canadian Law Enforcement agency operates nodes running modified Freenet software in the hope of determining who is requesting illegal material.\nNotability.\nFreenet has had significant publicity in the mainstream press, including articles in \"The New York Times\", and coverage on CNN, 60 Minutes II, the BBC, The Guardian, and elsewhere.\nFreenet received the SUMA-Award 2014 for \"protection against total surveillance.\"\nFreesite.\nA \"freesite\" is a site hosted on the Freenet network. Because it contains only static content, it cannot contain any active content like server side scripts or databases. Freesites are coded in HTML and support as many features as the browser viewing the page allows; however, there are some exceptions where the Freenet software will remove parts of the code that may be used to reveal the identity of the person viewing the page (making a page access something on the internet, for example)."}
{"id": "10998", "revid": "10000761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10998", "title": "Fortified wine", "text": "Fortified wine is a wine to which a distilled spirit, usually brandy, has been added. In the course of some centuries,\nwinemakers have developed many different styles of fortified wine, including port, sherry, madeira, Marsala, Commandaria wine, and the aromatised wine vermouth.\nProduction.\nOne reason for fortifying wine was to preserve it, since ethanol is a natural antiseptic. Even though other preservation methods now exist, fortification continues to be used because the process can add distinct flavors to the finished product.\nAlthough grape brandy is most commonly added to produce fortified wines, the additional alcohol may also be neutral spirit that has been made from grapes, grain, sugar beets or sugarcane. Regional appellation laws may dictate the types of spirit that are permitted for fortification. For example, in the U.S. only spirits from fruit may be used.\nThe source of the additional alcohol and the method of its distillation can affect the flavour of the fortified wine. If neutral spirit is used, it will usually have been produced with a continuous still, rather than a pot still.\nWhen added to wine before the fermentation process is complete, the alcohol in the distilled beverage kills the yeast and leaves residual sugar behind. The end result is a wine that is both sweeter and stronger, normally containing about 20% alcohol by volume (ABV).\nDuring the fermentation process, yeast cells in the must continue to convert sugar into alcohol until the must reaches an alcohol level of 16\u201318%. At this level, the alcohol becomes toxic to the yeast and stalls its metabolism. If fermentation is allowed to run to completion, the resulting wine will (in most cases) be low in sugar and will be considered a dry wine. The earlier in the fermentation process that alcohol is added, the sweeter the resulting wine will be. For drier fortified wine styles, such as sherry, the alcohol is added shortly before or after the end of the fermentation.\nIn the case of some fortified wine styles (such as late harvest and botrytized wines), a naturally high level of sugar will inhibit the yeast. This causes fermentation to stop before the wine can become dry.\nVarieties.\nCommandaria wine.\nCommandaria is made in Cyprus' unique AOC region north of Limassol from high altitude vines of Mavro and Xynisteri, sun dried and aged in oak barrels. Recent developments have produced different styles of Commandaria, some of which are not fortified.\nMadeira wine.\nMadeira is a fortified wine made in the Madeira Islands. The wine is produced in a variety of styles ranging from dry wines which can be consumed on their own as an aperitif, to sweet wines more usually consumed with dessert. Madeira is deliberately heated and oxidised as part of its maturation process, resulting in distinctive flavours and an unusually long lifespan once a bottle is opened.\nMarsala wine.\nMarsala wine is a wine from Sicily that is available in both fortified and unfortified versions. It was first produced in 1772 by an English merchant, John Woodhouse, as an inexpensive substitute for sherry and port, and gets its name from the island's port, Marsala. The fortified version is blended with brandy to make two styles, the younger, slightly weaker \"Fine\", which is at least 17% abv and aged at least four months; and the \"Superiore\", which is at least 18%, and aged at least two years. The unfortified Marsala wine is aged in wooden casks for five years or more and reaches a strength of 18% by evaporation.\nMistelle.\nMistelle (; ; Spanish, Portuguese, Galician and , from Latin / \"mix\") is sometimes used as an ingredient in fortified wines, particularly Vermouth, Marsala and Sherry, though it is used mainly as a base for ap\u00e9ritifs such as the French Pineau des Charentes. It is produced by adding alcohol to non-fermented or partially fermented grape juice (or apple juice to make pommeau). The addition of alcohol stops the fermentation and, as a consequence Mistelle is sweeter than fully fermented grape juice in which the sugars turn to alcohol.\nMoscatel de Set\u00fabal.\nMoscatel de Set\u00fabal is a Portuguese wine produced around the Set\u00fabal Municipality on the Pen\u00ednsula de Set\u00fabal. The wine is made primarily from the Muscat of Alexandria grape and typically fortified with aguardente. The style was believed to have been invented by Jos\u00e9 Maria da Fonseca, the founder of the oldest table wine company in Portugal dating back to 1834.\nPort wine.\nPort wine (also known simply as port) is a fortified wine from the Douro Valley in the northern provinces of Portugal. It is typically a sweet red wine, but also comes in dry, semi-dry and white varieties.\nSherry.\nSherry is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the town of Jerez, Spain. The word \"sherry\" itself is an anglicisation of Jerez. In earlier times, sherry was known as \"sack\" (from the Spanish \"saca\", meaning \"a removal from the solera\"). In the European Union \"sherry\" is a protected designation of origin; therefore, all wine labelled as \"sherry\" must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, which is an area in the province of C\u00e1diz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda.\nAfter fermentation is complete, sherry is fortified with brandy. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine (for example) is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.\nSherry is produced in a variety of styles, ranging from dry, light versions such as finos to much darker and sometimes sweeter versions known as olorosos. Cream sherry is always sweet.\nVermouth.\nVermouth is a fortified wine flavoured with aromatic herbs and spices (\"aromatised\" in the trade) using closely guarded recipes (trade secrets). Some of the herbs and spices used may include cardamom, cinnamon, marjoram and chamomile. Some vermouth is sweetened; however, unsweetened or dry, vermouth tends to be bitter. The person credited with the second vermouth recipe, Antonio Benedetto Carpano from Turin, Italy, chose to name his concoction \"vermouth\" in 1786 because he was inspired by a German wine flavoured with wormwood, an herb most famously used in distilling absinthe. However, wine flavoured with wormwood goes back to ancient Rome. The modern German word \"Wermut\" (\"Wermuth\" in the spelling of Carpano's time) means both \"wormwood\" and \"vermouth\". The herbs were originally used to mask raw flavours of cheaper wines, imparting a slightly medicinal \"tonic\" flavor.\nVins doux naturels.\nVins doux naturels are lightly fortified wines typically made from white Muscat grapes or red Grenache grapes in the south of France. The production of vins doux naturels was perfected by Arnaud de Villeneuve at the University of Montpellier in the 13th century and they are now quite common in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France.\nAs the name suggests, Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, Muscat de Rivesaltes and Muscat de Frontignan are all made from the white Muscat grape, whilst Banyuls and Maury are made from red Grenache. Other wines, like those of Rivesaltes AOC, can be made from red or white grapes. Regardless of the grape, fermentation is stopped by the addition of up to 10% of a 190 proof (95%) grape spirit. The Grenache vins doux naturels can be made in an oxidised or unoxidised style whereas the Muscat wines are protected from oxidation to retain their freshness.\nLow-end fortified wines.\nInexpensive fortified wines, such as Thunderbird and Wild Irish Rose, became popular during the Great Depression for their relatively high alcohol content. The term \"wino\" was coined during this period to describe impoverished people who drank these wines solely for their inebriating effect.\nThese wines continue to be associated with the homeless, mainly because marketers have been aggressive in targeting low-income communities as ideal consumers of these beverages; organisations in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland have urged makers of inexpensive fortified wine, including E &amp; J Gallo Winery, to stop providing such products to liquor stores in impoverished areas. In 2005, the Seattle City Council asked the Washington State Liquor Control Board to prohibit the sale of certain alcohol products in an impoverished \"Alcohol Impact Area.\" Among the products sought to be banned were over two dozen beers, and six fortified wines: Cisco, Gino's Premium Blend, MD 20/20, Night Train, Thunderbird, and Wild Irish Rose. The Liquor Control Board approved these restrictions on August 30, 2006.\nGwaha-ju.\n\"Gwaha-ju\" is a fortified rice wine made in Korea.\nAlthough rice wine is not made from grapes, it has a similar alcohol content to grape wine, and the addition of the distilled spirit, soju, and other ingredients like ginseng, jujubes, ginger, etc., to the rice wine, bears similarity to the above-mentioned fortified wines.\nTerminology.\nFortified wines are often termed dessert wines in the United States to avoid association with hard drinking. The term \"vins de liqueur\" is used by the French.\nUnder European Union legislation, a liqueur wine is a fortified wine that contains 15\u201322% abv, with Total Alcoholic Strength no less than 17.5%, and that meets many additional criteria. Exemptions are allowed for certain quality liqueur wines."}

He also wrote science fiction novels, short stories and radio plays, and co-authored twelve books with his son, Geoffrey Hoyle. He spent most of his working life at the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge and served as its director for six years. He was one of the authors of the influential B2FH paper.\nEarly life and career.\nHoyle was born near Bingley in Gilstead, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. His father, Ben Hoyle, who was a violinist and worked in the wool trade in Bradford, served as a machine gunner in the First World War. His mother, Mabel Pickard, had studied music at the Royal College of Music in London and later worked as a cinema pianist. Hoyle was educated at Bingley Grammar School and read mathematics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.\nIn 1936 he won the Mayhew Prize (jointly with George Stanley Rushbrooke).\nIn late 1940, Hoyle left Cambridge to go to Portsmouth to work for the Admiralty on radar research, for example devising a method to get the altitude of the incoming aeroplanes. He was also put in charge of countermeasures against the radar guided guns found on the \"Graf Spee\". Britain's radar project employed more personnel than the Manhattan project, and was probably the inspiration for the large British project in \"The Black Cloud\". Two key colleagues in this war work were Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold, and the three had many and deep discussions on cosmology. The radar work paid for a couple of trips to North America, where he took the opportunity to visit astronomers. On one trip to the US he learned about supernovae at Caltech and Mount Palomar and, in Canada, the nuclear physics of plutonium implosion and explosion, noticed some similarity between the two and started thinking about supernova nucleosynthesis. He had an intuition at the time \"I will make a name for myself if this works out.\" Eventually (1954) his prescient and ground breaking paper came out. He also formed a group at Cambridge exploring stellar nucleosynthesis in ordinary stars and was bothered by the paucity of stellar carbon production in existing models. He noticed that one of the existing processes would be made a billion times more productive if the carbon-12 nucleus had a resonance at 7.7 MeV, but the nuclear physicists did not list such a one. On another trip he visited the nuclear physics group at Caltech, spending a few months of sabbatical there and persuaded them against their considerable scepticism to look for and find the Hoyle state in carbon-12, from which developed a full theory of stellar nucleosynthesis, co-authored by Hoyle with some members of the Caltech group.\nAfter the war, in 1945, Hoyle returned to Cambridge University, as a lecturer at St John's College, Cambridge. Hoyle's Cambridge years, 1945\u20131973, saw him rise to the top of world astrophysics theory, on the basis of a startling originality of ideas covering a very wide range of topics. In 1958, Hoyle was appointed to the illustrious Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy at Cambridge University. In 1967, he became the founding director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy (subsequently renamed the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, where Hoyle's innovative leadership quickly led to this institution becoming one of the premier groups in the world for theoretical astrophysics. In 1971 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject \"Astronomical Instruments and their Construction\". Hoyle was knighted in 1972. Hoyle resigned his Plumian professor position in 1972 and his directorship of the institute in 1973, with this move effectively cutting him off from most of his establishment power-base, connections and steady salary.\nAfter leaving Cambridge, Hoyle wrote many popular science and science fiction books, as well as presenting lectures around the world. Part of the motivation for this was simply to provide a means of support. Hoyle was still a member of the joint policy committee (since 1967), during the planning stage for the 150-inch Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales. He became chairman of the Anglo-Australian Telescope board in 1973, and presided at its inauguration in 1974 by Charles, Prince of Wales.\nDecline and death.\nAfter his resignation from Cambridge, Hoyle moved to the Lake District and occupied his time with a mix of treks across the moors, writing books, visiting research centres around the world, and working on science ideas that have been nearly-universally rejected. On 24 November 1997, while hiking across moorlands in west Yorkshire, near his childhood home in Gilstead, Hoyle fell down into a steep ravine called Shipley Glen. Roughly twelve hours later, Hoyle was found by a search dog. He was hospitalised for two months with pneumonia and kidney problems (both resulting from hypothermia), as well as a broken shoulder from the fall. Thereafter he entered a marked decline, suffering from memory and mental agility problems. In 2001, he suffered a series of strokes and died in Bournemouth on 20 August of that year.\nOrigin of nucleosynthesis.\nHoyle authored the first two research papers ever published on the synthesis of the chemical elements heavier than helium by nuclear reactions in stars. The first of these in 1946 showed that the cores of stars will evolve to temperatures of billions of degrees, much hotter than temperatures considered for thermonuclear origin of stellar power in main-sequence stars. Hoyle showed that at such high temperatures the element iron can become much more abundant than other heavy elements owing to thermal equilibrium among nuclear particles, explaining the high natural abundance of iron. This idea would later be called the e Process. Hoyle's second foundational nucleosynthesis publication, published in 1954, showed that the elements between carbon and iron cannot be synthesized by such equilibrium processes. He attributed those elements to specific nuclear fusion reactions between abundant constituents in concentric shells of evolved massive, pre-supernova stars. This startlingly modern picture is the accepted paradigm today for the supernova nucleosynthesis of these primary elements. In the mid-1950s, Hoyle became the leader of a group of very talented experimental and theoretical physicists who met in Cambridge: William Alfred Fowler, Margaret Burbidge, and Geoffrey Burbidge. This group systematized basic ideas of how all the chemical elements in our universe were created, with this now being a field called nucleosynthesis. Famously, in 1957, this group produced the B2FH paper (known for the initials of the four authors) in which the field of nucleosynthesis was organized into complementary nuclear processes. They also added much new material on the synthesis of heavy elements by neutron-capture reactions, the so-called s process and the r process. So influential did the B2FH paper become that for the remainder of the twentieth century it became the default citation of almost all researchers wishing to cite an accepted origin for nucleosynthesis theory, and as a result, the path-breaking Hoyle 1954 paper fell into obscurity. Historical research in the 21st century has brought Hoyle's 1954 paperback to scientific prominence. Those historical arguments were first presented to a gathering of nucleosynthesis experts attending a 2007 conference at Caltech organized after the deaths of both Fowler and Hoyle to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the publication of B2FH. Ironically the B2FH paper did not review Hoyle's 1954 supernova-shells attribution of the origin of elements between silicon and iron despite Hoyle's co-authorship of B2FH. Based on his many personal discussions with Hoyle Donald D. Clayton has attributed this seemingly inexplicable oversight in B2FH to the lack of proofreading by Hoyle of the draft composed at Caltech in 1956 by G.R. Burbidge and E.M. Burbidge.\nThe second of Hoyle's nucleosynthesis papers also introduced an interesting use of the anthropic principle, which was not then known by that name. In trying to work out the routes of stellar nucleosynthesis, Hoyle calculated that one particular nuclear reaction, the triple-alpha process, which generates carbon from helium, would require the carbon nucleus to have a very specific resonance energy and spin for it to work. The large amount of carbon in the universe, which makes it possible for carbon-based life-forms of any kind to exist, demonstrated to Hoyle that this nuclear reaction must work. Based on this notion, Hoyle therefore predicted the values of the energy, the nuclear spin and the parity of the compound state in the carbon nucleus formed by three alpha particles (helium nuclei), which was later borne out by experiment.\nThis energy level, while needed to produce carbon in large quantities, was statistically very unlikely to fall where it does in the scheme of carbon energy levels. Hoyle later wrote:\nHis co-worker William Alfred Fowler eventually won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1983 (with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar), but for some reason Hoyle's original contribution was overlooked by the electors, and many were surprised that such a notable astronomer missed out. Fowler himself in an autobiographical sketch affirmed Hoyle's pioneering efforts:\nRejection of the Big Bang.\nWhile having no argument with the Lema\u00eetre theory (later confirmed by Edwin Hubble's observations) that the universe was expanding, Hoyle disagreed on its interpretation. He found the idea that the universe had a beginning to be pseudoscience, resembling arguments for a creator, \"for it's an irrational process, and can't be described in scientific terms\" (see Kalam cosmological argument). Instead, Hoyle, along with Thomas Gold and Hermann Bondi (with whom he had worked on radar in the Second World War), in 1948 began to argue for the universe as being in a \"steady state\" and formulated their Steady State theory. The theory tried to explain how the universe could be eternal and essentially unchanging while still having the galaxies we observe moving away from each other. The theory hinged on the creation of matter between galaxies over time, so that even though galaxies get further apart, new ones that develop between them fill the space they leave. The resulting universe is in a \"steady state\" in the same manner that a flowing river is\u2014the individual water molecules are moving away but the overall river remains the same.\nThe theory was one alternative to the Big Bang which, like the Big Bang, agreed with key observations of the day, namely Hubble's red shift observations, and Hoyle was a strong critic of the Big Bang. He coined the term \"Big Bang\" on BBC radio's \"Third Programme\" broadcast on 28 March 1949. It was popularly reported by George Gamov and his opponents that Hoyle intended to be pejorative, and the script from which he read aloud was interpreted by his opponents to be \"vain, one-sided, insulting, not worthy of the BBC\". Hoyle explicitly denied that he was being insulting and said it was just a striking image meant to emphasize the difference between the two theories for the radio audience. In another BBC interview he said \"The reason why scientists like the \"big bang\" is because they are overshadowed by the Book of Genesis. It is deep within the psyche of most scientists to believe in the first page of Genesis\".\nHoyle had a famously heated argument with Martin Ryle of the Cavendish Radio Astronomy Group about Hoyle's steady state theory, which somewhat restricted collaboration between the Cavendish group and the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy during the 1960s.\nHoyle, unlike Gold and Bondi, offered an explanation for the appearance of new matter by postulating the existence of what he dubbed the \"creation field\", or just the \"C-field\", which had negative pressure in order to be consistent with the conservation of energy and drive the expansion of the universe. This C-field is the same as the later \"de Sitter solution\" for cosmic inflation, but the C-field model acts much slower than the de Sitter inflation model. They jointly argued that continuous creation was no more inexplicable than the appearance of the entire universe from nothing, although it had to be done on a regular basis. In the end, mounting observational evidence convinced most cosmologists that the steady state model was incorrect and that the Big Bang was the theory that agreed better with observations, although Hoyle continued to support and develop his theory. In 1993, in an attempt to explain some of the evidence against the steady state theory, he presented a modified version called \"quasi-steady state cosmology\" (QSS), but the theory is not widely accepted.\nThe evidence that resulted in the Big Bang's victory over the steady state model included the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1960s, and the distribution of \"young galaxies\" and quasars throughout the Universe in the 1980s indicate a more consistent age estimate of the universe. Hoyle died in 2001 never accepting the Big Bang theory.\nTheory of gravity.\nTogether with Narlikar, Hoyle developed a particle theory in the 1960s, the Hoyle\u2013Narlikar theory of gravity. It made predictions that were roughly the same as Einstein's general relativity, but it incorporated Mach's Principle, which Einstein had tried but failed to incorporate in his theory. The Hoyle-Narlikar theory fails several tests, including consistency with the microwave background. It was motivated by their belief in the steady state model of the universe.\nRejection of Earth-based abiogenesis.\nIn his later years, Hoyle became a staunch critic of theories of abiogenesis to explain the origin of life on Earth. With Chandra Wickramasinghe, Hoyle promoted the hypothesis that the first life on Earth began in space, spreading through the universe via panspermia, and that evolution on Earth is influenced by a steady influx of viruses arriving via comets. His belief that comets had a significant percentage of organic compounds was well ahead of his time, as the dominant views in the 1970s and 1980s were that comets largely consisted of water-ice, and the presence of organic compounds was then highly controversial. Wickramasinghe wrote in 2003: \"In the highly polarized polemic between Darwinism and creationism, our position is unique. Although we do not align ourselves with either side, both sides treat us as opponents. Thus we are outsiders with an unusual perspective\u2014and our suggestion for a way out of the crisis has not yet been considered.\"\nHoyle and Wickramasinghe advanced several instances where they say outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the 1918 flu pandemic, and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease. For the 1918 flu pandemic, they hypothesized that cometary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations\u2014a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. In 1982 Hoyle presented \"Evolution from Space\" for the Royal Institution's Omni Lecture. After considering what he thought of as a very remote possibility of Earth-based abiogenesis he concluded:\nPublished in his 1982/1984 books \"Evolution from Space\" (co-authored with Chandra Wickramasinghe), Hoyle calculated that the chance of obtaining the required set of enzymes for even the simplest living cell without panspermia was one in 1040,000. Since the number of atoms in the known universe is infinitesimally tiny by comparison (1080), he argued that Earth as life's place of origin could be ruled out. He claimed:\nApparently, Hoyle had not heard of the RNA world or the evolution of proteins from simple peptides, hence his calculations were not compatible with modern molecular evolution.\nThough Hoyle declared himself an atheist, this apparent suggestion of a guiding hand led him to the conclusion that \"a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and ... there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature.\" He would go on to compare the random emergence of even the simplest cell without panspermia to the likelihood that \"a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein\" and to compare the chance of obtaining even a single functioning protein by chance combination of amino acids to a solar system full of blind men solving Rubik's Cubes simultaneously. This is known as \"the junkyard tornado\", or \"Hoyle\u2019s Fallacy\". Those who advocate the intelligent design (ID) belief sometimes cite Hoyle's work in this area to support the claim that the universe was fine tuned in order to allow intelligent life to be possible.\nOther controversies.\nWhile Hoyle was well-regarded for his works on nucleosynthesis and science popularization, he held controversial positions on a wide range of scientific issues, often in direct opposition to the prevailing theories of the scientific community. Paul Davies describes how he \"loved his maverick personality and contempt for orthodoxy\", quoting Hoyle as saying \"I don't care what they think\" about his theories on discrepant redshift, and \"it is better to be interesting and wrong than boring and right\".\nHoyle often expressed anger against the labyrinthine and petty politics at Cambridge and frequently feuded with members and institutions of all levels of the British astronomy community, leading to his resignation from Cambridge in September 1971 over the way he thought Donald Lynden-Bell was chosen to replace retiring professor Roderick Oliver Redman behind his back. According to biographer Simon Mitton, Hoyle was crestfallen because he felt that his colleagues at Cambridge were unsupportive.\nIn addition to his views on steady state theory and panspermia, Hoyle also supported the following controversial hypotheses and speculations:\nNobel Physics Prizes.\nHoyle was also at the centre of two unrelated controversies involving the politics for selecting the winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics. The first came when the 1974 prize went, in part, to Antony Hewish for his leading role in the discovery of pulsars. Promptly Hoyle made an off-the-cuff remark to a reporter in Montreal that \"Yes, Jocelyn Bell was the actual discoverer, not Hewish, who was her supervisor, so she should have been included.\" This remark received widespread international coverage. Worried about being misunderstood and by British libel laws, Hoyle carefully composed a letter of explanation to \"The Times\".\nThe second controversy came when the 1983 prize went in part to William Alfred Fowler \"for his theoretical and experimental studies of the nuclear reactions of importance in the formation of the chemical elements in the universe.\" The controversy arose because Hoyle had been the inventor of the theory of nucleosynthesis in the stars with two research papers published shortly after WWII. So some suspicion arose that Hoyle was denied the third share of this prize because of his earlier public disagreement with the 1974 award. British scientist Harry Kroto later said that the Nobel Prize is not just an award for a piece of work, but a recognition of a scientist's overall reputation and Hoyle's championing many disreputable and disproven ideas may have invalidated him. In \"Nature\", editor John Maddox called it \"shameful\" that Fowler had been rewarded with a Nobel prize and Hoyle had not.\nMedia appearances.\nHoyle appeared in a series of radio talks on astronomy for the BBC in the 1950s; these were collected in the book \"The Nature of the Universe\", and he went on to write a number of other popular science books.\nIn the play \"Sur la route de Montalcino\", the character of Fred Hoyle confronts Georges Lema\u00eetre on a fictional journey to the Vatican in 1957.\nHoyle also appeared in the 1973 short film \"Take the World From Another Point of View\".\nIn the 2004 television movie \"Hawking\", Fred Hoyle is played by Peter Firth. In the movie, Stephen Hawking (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) publicly confronts Hoyle at a Royal Society lecture in summer 1964, about a mistake he found in his latest publication.\nHonours.\nAwards\nNamed after him\nFonds.\nThe Fred Hoyle Collection at St John's College Library contains \"a pair of walking boots, five boxes of photographs, two ice axes, some dental X-rays, a telescope, ten large film reels and an unpublished opera\" in addition to 150 document boxes of papers.\nBibliography.\nScience fiction.\nHoyle also wrote science fiction. In his first novel, \"The Black Cloud\", most intelligent life in the universe takes the form of interstellar gas clouds; they are surprised to learn that intelligent life can also form on planets. He wrote a television series, \"A for Andromeda\", which was also published as a novel. His play \"Rockets in Ursa Major\" had a professional production at the Mermaid Theatre in 1962.\nMost of these are independent of each other. \"Andromeda Breakthrough\" is a sequel to \"A for Andromeda\" and \"Into Deepest Space\" is a sequel to \"Rockets in Ursa Major\". The four Ladybird Books are intended for children.\nSome stories of the anthology \"Element 79\" are fantasy, in particular \"Welcome to Slippage City\" and \"The Judgement of Aphrodite\". Both introduce mythological characters.\n\"The Telegraph\" (UK) called him a \"masterful\" science fiction writer."}

In the 17th century, chefs Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne and Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style.\nCheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and \"appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\" (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.\nFrench cuisine was made important in the 20th century by Auguste Escoffier to become the modern \"haute cuisine\"; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary character to be found in the regions of France and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks.\nCulinary tourism and the \"Guide Michelin\" helped to acquaint people with the \"cuisine bourgeoise\" of the urban elites and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.\nKnowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards and culinary education. In November 2010, French gastronomy was added by the UNESCO to its lists of the world's \"intangible cultural heritage\".\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn French medieval cuisine, banquets were common among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but served in a style called \"service en confusion\", or all at once. Food was generally eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used.\nPies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, and it was not until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed.\nMeals often ended with an \"issue de table\", which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of \"drag\u00e9es\" (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.\nThe ingredients of the time varied greatly according to the seasons and the church calendar, and many items were preserved with salt, spices, honey, and other preservatives. Late spring, summer, and autumn afforded abundance, while winter meals were more sparse. Livestock were slaughtered at the beginning of winter. Beef was often salted, while pork was salted and smoked. Bacon and sausages would be smoked in the chimney, while the tongue and hams were brined and dried. Cucumbers were brined as well, while greens would be packed in jars with salt. Fruits, nuts and root vegetables would be boiled in honey for preservation. Whale, dolphin and porpoise were considered fish, so during Lent, the salted meats of these sea mammals were eaten.\nArtificial freshwater ponds (often called \"stews\") held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry was kept in special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds.\nKitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time\u2014they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale.\nSweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and \"verjus\" combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial to make use of nutrients.\nVisual display was prized. Brilliant colors were obtained by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from \"Crozophora tinctoria\" or \"Heliotropium europaeum\".\nGold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as \"tourte parmerienne\" which was a pastry dish made to look like a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.\nThe most well known French chef of the Middle Ages was Guillaume Tirel, also known as Taillevent. Taillevent worked in numerous royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to Philip VI, then the Dauphin who was son of John II. The Dauphin became King Charles V of France in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, \"marmites\", on it.\nAncien R\u00e9gime.\nParis was the central hub of culture and economic activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as \"Les Halles\", \"la M\u00e9gisserie\", those found along \"Rue Mouffetard\", and similar smaller versions in other cities were very important to the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the guild system, which developed in the Middle Ages. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government as well as by the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.\nThere were two groups of guilds\u2014first, those that supplied the raw materials: butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods: bakers, pastry cooks, sauce makers, poulterers, and caterers. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the \"charcutiers\" and \"r\u00f4tisseurs\" (purveyors of roasted meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials.\nThe guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed a high level of income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the guild hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks' guild regulations allowed for this movement.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the New World. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show Catherine de' Medici (1519\u20131589?) serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner. The dish called cassoulet has its roots in the New World discovery of haricot beans, which are central to the dish's creation, but had not existed outside of the Americas until the arrival of European colonizers.\n\"Haute cuisine\" (, \"high cuisine\") has foundations during the 17th century with a chef named La Varenne. As author of works such as \"Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois\", he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His book includes the earliest known reference to roux using pork fat. The book contained two sections, one for meat days, and one for fasting. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers. La Varenne also published a book on pastry in 1667 entitled \"Le Parfait confitvrier\" (republished as \"Le Confiturier fran\u00e7ois\") which similarly updated and codified the emerging \"haute cuisine\" standards for desserts and pastries.\nChef Fran\u00e7ois Massialot wrote \"Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois\" in 1691, during the reign of Louis XIV. The book contains menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a marinade is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.\nThe successive updates of \"Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois\" include important refinements such as adding a glass of wine to fish stock. Definitions were also added to the 1703 edition. The 1712 edition, retitled \"Le Nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois\", was increased to two volumes, and was written in a more elaborate style with extensive explanations of technique. Additional smaller preparations are included in this edition as well, leading to lighter preparations, and adding a third course to the meal. Ragout, a stew still central to French cookery, makes its first appearance as a single dish in this edition as well; prior to that, it was listed as a garnish.\nLate 18th century \u2013 early 19th century.\nShortly before the French Revolution, dishes like \"\" gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine produced by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on \"vol-au-vent\" created under the influence of Queen Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, the Polish-born wife of Louis XV. This recipe is still popular today, as are other recipes from Queen Marie Leszczy\u0144ska like \"consomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la Reine\" and \"filet d'aloyau brais\u00e9 \u00e0 la royale\". Queen Marie is also credited with introducing lentils to the French diet and Polonaise garnishing.\nThe French Revolution was integral to the expansion of French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item they wished.\nBread was a significant food source among peasants and the working class in the late 18th century, with many of the nation's people being dependent on it. In French provinces, bread was often consumed three times a day by the people of France. According to Brace, bread was referred to as the basic dietary item for the masses, and it was also used as a foundation for soup. In fact, bread was so important that harvest, interruption of commerce by wars, heavy flour exploration, and prices and supply were all watched and controlled by the French Government. Among the underprivileged, constant fear of famine was always prevalent. From 1725 to 1789, there were fourteen years of bad yields to blame for low grain supply. In Bordeaux, during 1708\u20131789, thirty-three bad harvests occurred.\nMarie-Antoine Car\u00eame was born in 1784, five years before the Revolution. He spent his younger years working at a \"p\u00e2tisserie\" until he was discovered by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, who would later cook for Napoleon Bonaparte. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Car\u00eame had become known for his \"pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es\", which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.\nMore important to Car\u00eame's career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking was his sauces, which he named mother sauces. Often referred to as fonds, meaning \"foundations\", these base sauces, \"espagnole\", \"velout\u00e9\", and \"b\u00e9chamel\", are still known today. Each of these sauces was made in large quantities in his kitchen, then formed the basis of multiple derivatives. Car\u00eame had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire.\nIn his writings, souffl\u00e9s appear for the first time. Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that existed beforehand. Central to his codification of the cuisine were \"Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais\" (1822), \"Le Cuisinier parisien\" (1828) and \"L'Art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle\" (1833\u20135).\nLate 19th century \u2013 early 20th century.\nGeorges Auguste Escoffier is commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of \"haute cuisine\" and organizing what would become the national cuisine of France. His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s-1890s. The Savoy Hotel managed by C\u00e9sar Ritz was an early hotel in which Escoffier worked, but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921. He created a system of \"parties\" called the brigade system, which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations.\nThese five stations included the \"garde manger\" that prepared cold dishes; the \"entremettier\" prepared starches and vegetables, the \"r\u00f4tisseur\" prepared roasts, grilled and fried dishes; the \"saucier\" prepared sauces and soups; and the \"p\u00e2tissier\" prepared all pastry and desserts items.\nThis system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on one's own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish. An example used is \"oeufs au plat Meyerbeer\", the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish, while in the new system, the eggs would be prepared by the \"entremettier\", kidney grilled by the \"r\u00f4tisseur\", truffle sauce made by the \"saucier\" and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants.\nEscoffier also simplified and organized the modern menu and structure of the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his \"Livre des menus\" in 1912. This type of service embraced the \"service \u00e0 la russe\" (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which F\u00e9lix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of \"Le Guide Culinaire\" in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Phil\u00e9as Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.\n\"Le Guide Culinaire\" deemphasized the use of heavy sauces and leaned toward lighter \"fumets\", which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose function is to add to the flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Car\u00eame, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's \"Le Viandier\", which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of \"haute cuisine\".\nExpensive ingredients would replace the common ingredients, making the dishes much less humble. The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself, who invented many new dishes, such as \"p\u00eache Melba\". Escoffier updated \"Le Guide Culinaire\" four times during his lifetime, noting in the foreword to the book's first edition that even with its 5,000 recipes, the book should not be considered an \"exhaustive\" text, and that even if it were at the point when he wrote the book, \"it would no longer be so tomorrow, because progress marches on each day.\"\nThis period is also marked by the appearance of the \"nouvelle cuisine\". The term \"nouvelle cuisine\" has been used many times in the history of French cuisine which emphasized the freshness, lightness and clarity of flavor and inspired by new movements in world cuisine. In the 1740s, Menon first used the term, but the cooking of Vincent La Chapelle and Fran\u00e7ois Marin was also considered modern. In the 1960s, Henri Gault and Christian Millau revived it to describe the cooking of Paul Bocuse, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, Michel Gu\u00e9rard, Roger Verg\u00e9 and Raymond Oliver. These chefs were working toward rebelling against the \"orthodoxy\" of Escoffier's cuisine. Some of the chefs were students of Fernand Point at the \"Pyramide\" in Vienne, and had left to open their own restaurants. Gault and Millau \"discovered the formula\" contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking.\nThe first characteristic was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and p\u00e2t\u00e9s was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as \"espagnole\" and \"b\u00e9chamel\" thickened with flour based \"roux\" in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of \"haute cuisine\" dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth, and finally, the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.\nSome have speculated that a contributor to \"nouvelle cuisine\" was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation. By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the \"haute cuisine\" style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.\nNational cuisine.\nThere are many dishes that are considered part of French national cuisine today.\nA meal often consists of three courses, \"hors d'\u0153uvre\" or \"entr\u00e9e\" (introductory course, sometimes soup), \"plat principal\" (main course), \"fromage\" (cheese course) or \"dessert\", sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert.\nRegional cuisine.\nFrench regional cuisine is characterized by its extreme diversity and style. Traditionally, each region of France has its own distinctive cuisine.\nParis and \u00cele-de-France.\nParis and \u00cele-de-France are central regions where almost anything from the country is available, as all train lines meet in the city. Over 9,000 restaurants exist in Paris and almost any cuisine can be obtained here. High-quality Michelin Guide-rated restaurants proliferate here.\nChampagne, Lorraine, and Alsace.\nGame and ham are popular in Champagne, as well as the special sparkling wine simply known as \"Champagne\". Fine fruit preserves are known from Lorraine as well as the quiche Lorraine. Alsace is influenced by the German cuisine, especially the one from the Palatinate and Baden region. As such, beers made in the area are similar to the style of bordering Germany. Dishes like \"choucroute\" (French for \"sauerkraut\") are also popular. Many \"Eaux de vie\" (distilled alcohol from fruit) also called schnaps are from this region, due to a wide variety of local fruits (cherry, raspberry, pear, grapes) and especially prunes (mirabelle, plum).[9]:259,295\nNord Pas-de-Calais, Picardy, Normandy, and Brittany.\nThe coastline supplies many crustaceans, sea bass, monkfish and herring. Normandy has top-quality seafood, such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has a supply of lobster, crayfish and mussels.\nNormandy is home to a large population of apple trees; apples are often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and chicory. Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well.\nThe produce of these northern regions is also considered some of the best in the country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's \"galettes\", called \"jalet\", which is where this dish originated.\nLoire Valley and central France.\nHigh-quality fruits come from the Loire Valley and central France, including cherries grown for the liqueur \"Guignolet\" and \"Belle Angevine\" pears. The strawberries and melons are also of high quality.\nFish are seen in the cuisine, often served with a \"beurre blanc\" sauce, as well as wild game, lamb, calves, Charolais cattle, \"G\u00e9line\" fowl, and goat cheeses.\nYoung vegetables are used often, as are the specialty mushrooms of the region, \"champignons de Paris\". Vinegars from Orl\u00e9ans are a specialty ingredient used as well.\nBurgundy and Franche-Comt\u00e9.\nBurgundy and Franche-Comt\u00e9 are known for their wines. Pike, perch, river crabs, snails, game, redcurrants, blackcurrants are from both Burgundy and Franche-Comt\u00e9.\nAmongst savorous specialties accounted in the \"Cuisine franc-comtoise\" from the Franche-Comt\u00e9 region are ', ', trout, smoked meats and cheeses such as Mont d'Or, Comt\u00e9 and Morbier which are best eaten hot or cold, the exquisite ' and the special dessert '.\nCharolais beef, poultry from Bresse, sea snail, honey cake, Chaource and Epoisses cheese are specialties of the local cuisine of Burgundy. Dijon mustard is also a specialty of Burgundy cuisine. \"Cr\u00e8me de cassis\" is a popular liquor made from the blackcurrants. Oils are used in the cooking here, types include nut oils and rapeseed oil.\nAuvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes.\nThe area covers the old province of Dauphin\u00e9, once known as the \"larder\" of France, that gave its name to \"gratin dauphinois\", traditionally made in a large baking dish rubbed with garlic. Successive layers of potatoes, salt, pepper and milk are piled up to the top of the dish. It is then baked in the oven at low temperature for 2 hours.\nFruit and young vegetables are popular in the cuisine from the Rh\u00f4ne valley, as are great wines like Hermitage AOC, Crozes-Hermitage AOC and Condrieu AOC. Walnuts and walnut products and oil from Noix de Grenoble AOC, lowland cheeses, like St. Marcellin, St. F\u00e9licien and Bleu du Vercors-Sassenage.\nPoultry from Bresse, guinea fowl from Dr\u00f4me and fish from the Dombes, a light yeast-based cake, called Pogne de Romans and the regional speciality, \"Raviole du Dauphin\u00e9\", and there is the short-crust \"Suisse\", a Valence biscuit speciality.\nLakes and mountain streams in Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes are key to the cuisine as well. Lyon and Savoy supply sausages while the Alpine regions supply their specialty cheeses like Beaufort, Abondance, Reblochon, Tomme and Vacherin.\n\"M\u00e8res lyonnaises\" are female restaurateurs particular to this region who provide local gourmet establishments. Celebrated chefs from this region include Fernand Point, Paul Bocuse, the Troisgros brothers and Alain Chapel.\nThe Chartreuse Mountains are the source of the green and yellow Digestif liquor, Chartreuse produced by the monks of the Grande Chartreuse.\nSince the 2014 administrative reform, the ancient area of Auvergne is now part of the region. One of its leading chefs is Regis Marcon.\nPoitou-Charentes and Limousin.\nOysters come from the Ol\u00e9ron-Marennes basin, while mussels come from the Bay of Aiguillon.\nHigh-quality produce comes from the region's hinterland, especially goat cheese. This region and in the Vend\u00e9e is grazing ground for \"Parthenaise\" cattle, while poultry is raised in Challans.\nThe region of Poitou-Charentes purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. Cognac is also made in the region along the Charente River. \nLimousin is home to the Limousin cattle, as well as sheep. The woodlands offer game and mushrooms. The southern area around Brive draws its cooking influence from P\u00e9rigord and Auvergne to produce a robust cuisine.\nBordeaux, P\u00e9rigord, Gascony, and Basque country.\nBordeaux is known for its wine, with certain areas offering specialty grapes for wine-making. Fishing is popular in the region for the cuisine, sea fishing in the Bay of Biscay, trapping in the Garonne and stream fishing in the Pyrenees.\nThe Pyrenees also has lamb, such as the ', as well as sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the \"Blonde d'Aquitaine\", ', ', and '.\nFree-range chicken, turkey, pigeon, capon, goose and duck prevail in the region as well. Gascony and P\u00e9rigord cuisines includes \"p\u00e2t\u00e9s\", \"terrines\", \"confits\" and \"\". This is one of the regions notable for its production of \"foie gras\", or fattened goose or duck liver.\nThe cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based. Armagnac is also from this region, as are prunes from Agen.\nToulouse, Quercy, and Aveyron.\nGers, a department of France, is within this region and has poultry, while La Montagne Noire and Lacaune area offer hams and dry sausages.\nWhite corn is planted heavily in the area both for use in fattening ducks and geese for foie gras and for the production of \"\", a cornmeal porridge. Haricot beans are also grown in this area, which are central to the dish \"cassoulet\".\nThe finest sausage in France is \"saucisse de Toulouse\", which also part of \"cassoulet\" of Toulouse. The Cahors area produces a specialty \"black wine\" as well as truffles and mushrooms.\nThis region also produces milk-fed lamb. Unpasteurized ewe's milk is used to produce Roquefort in Aveyron, while in Laguiole is producing unpasteurized cow's milk cheese. Salers cattle produce milk for cheese, as well as beef and veal products.\nThe volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well. Cab\u00e9cou cheese is from Rocamadour, a medieval settlement erected directly on a cliff, in the rich countryside of .\nThis area is one of the region's oldest milk producers; it has chalky soil, marked by history and human activity, and is favourable for the raising of goats.\nRoussillon, Languedoc, and C\u00e9vennes.\nRestaurants are popular in the area known as \"Le Midi\". Oysters come from the \u00c9tang de Thau, to be served in the restaurants of Bouzigues, M\u00e8ze, and S\u00e8te. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of S\u00e8te, ', ' and \"rouille de seiche\".\nIn the Languedoc \"jambon cru\", sometimes known as \"jambon de montagne\" is produced. High quality \"Roquefort\" comes from the \"brebis\" (sheep) on the Larzac plateau.\nThe Les C\u00e9vennes area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, \"p\u00e2t\u00e9s\" and goat cheeses. Catalan influence can be seen in the cuisine here with dishes like \"brandade\" made from a pur\u00e9e of dried cod wrapped in mangold leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific \"Catalan\" style known as a \"cargolade\". Wild boar can be found in the more mountainous regions of the \"Midi\".\nProvence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur.\nThe Provence and C\u00f4te d'Azur region is rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits and herbs; the region is one of the largest suppliers of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in \"Haute Provence\". Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region.\nSeafood is widely available throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in \"Poulet Proven\u00e7al\", which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served.\nThe cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and \"fougasse\".\nRice is grown in the Camargue, which is the northernmost rice growing area in Europe, with Camargue red rice being a specialty. Anibal Camous, a Marseillais who lived to be 104, maintained that it was by eating garlic daily that he kept his \"youth\" and brilliance. When his eighty-year-old son died, the father mourned: \"I always told him he wouldn't live long, poor boy. He ate too little garlic!\" (\"cited by chef Philippe Gion\")\nCorsica.\nGoats and sheep proliferate on the island of Corsica, and lamb are used to prepare dishes such as \"\", \"ragouts\" and roasts. Cheeses are also produced, with \"brocciu\" being the most popular.\nChestnuts, growing in the Castagniccia forest, are used to produce flour, which is used in turn to make bread, cakes and \"polenta\". The forest provides acorns used to feed the pigs and boars that provide much of the protein for the island's cuisine. Fresh fish and seafood are common.\nThe island's pork is used to make fine hams, sausage and other unique items including \"coppa\" (dried rib cut), ' (dried pork fillet), ' (smoked and dried liverwurst), \"salumu\" (a dried sausage), \"salcietta\", \"Panzetta\", bacon, and \"\" (farmer's ham).\nClementines (which hold an AOC designation), lemons, nectarines and figs are grown there. Candied citron is used in nougats, while and the aforementioned \"brocciu\" and chestnuts are also used in desserts.\nCorsica offers a variety of wines and fruit liqueurs, including Cap Corse, Patrimonio, C\u00e9dratine, Bonapartine, \"\", \"vins de fruit\", , and \"eau-de-vie de ch\u00e2taigne\".\nFrench Guiana.\nFrench Guianan cuisine or Guianan cuisine is a blend of the different cultures that have settled in French Guiana. Creole and Chinese restaurants are common in major cities such as Cayenne, Kourou and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. Many indigenous animal species such as caiman and tapir are used in spiced stews.\nSpecialties by season.\nFrench cuisine varies according to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruits and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.\nWith the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned \"hypermarch\u00e9\", these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, but they are still observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. Crayfish, for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season. Moreover, they do not freeze well.\nFoods and ingredients.\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown vegetables, such as \"pomme de terre\" (potato), \"bl\u00e9\" (wheat), \"haricots verts\" (a type of French green bean), \"carotte\" (carrot), \"poireau\" (leek), \"navet\" (turnip), \"aubergine\" (eggplant), \"courgette\" (zucchini), and \"\u00e9chalotte\" (shallot).\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown fungi, such as \"truffe\" (truffle), \"champignon de Paris\" (button mushroom), \"chanterelle ou girolle\" (chanterelle), \"pleurote (en hu\u00eetre)\" (oyster mushrooms), and \"c\u00e8pes\" (porcini).\nCommon fruits include oranges, tomatoes, tangerines, peaches, apricots, apples, pears, plums, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, redcurrants, blackberries, grapes, grapefruit, and blackcurrants.\nVarieties of meat consumed include \"poulet\" (chicken), \"pigeon\" (squab), \"canard\" (duck), \"oie\" (goose, the source of foie gras), \"b\u0153uf\" (beef), \"veau\" (veal), \"porc\" (pork), \"agneau\" (lamb), \"mouton\" (mutton), \"caille\" (quail), \"cheval\" (horse), \"grenouille\" (frog), and \"escargot\" (snails). Commonly consumed fish and seafood include cod, canned sardines, fresh sardines, canned tuna, fresh tuna, salmon, trout, mussels, herring, oysters, shrimp and calamari.\nEggs are fine quality and often eaten as: omelettes, hard-boiled with mayonnaise, scrambled plain, scrambled \"haute cuisine\" preparation, \"\".\nHerbs and seasonings vary by region, and include \"fleur de sel\", \"herbes de Provence\", tarragon, rosemary, marjoram, lavender, thyme, fennel, and sage.\nFresh fruit and vegetables, as well as fish and meat, can be purchased either from supermarkets or specialty shops. Street markets are held on certain days in most localities; some towns have a more permanent covered market enclosing food shops, especially meat and fish retailers. These have better shelter than the periodic street markets.\nStructure of meals.\nBreakfast.\n\"Le petit d\u00e9jeuner\" (breakfast) is traditionally a quick meal consisting of \"tartines\" (slices) of French bread with butter and honey or jam (sometimes brioche), along with \"caf\u00e9 au lait\" (also called \"caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me\"), or black coffee, or tea and rarely hot chicory. Children often drink hot chocolate in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts. \"Croissants\", \"pain aux raisins\" or \"pain au chocolat\" (also named \"chocolatine\" in the south-west of France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. Breakfast of some kind is always served in caf\u00e9s opening early in the day.\nThere are also savoury dishes for breakfast. An example is \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner gaulois\" or \"petit d\u00e9jeuner fermier\" with the famous long narrow bread slices topped with soft white cheese or boiled ham, called \"mouillettes\", which is dipped in a soft-boiled egg and some fruit juice and hot drink.\nAnother variation called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner chasseur\", meant to be very hearty, is served with \"p\u00e2t\u00e9\" and other \"charcuterie\" products. A more classy version is called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner du voyageur\", where delicatessens serve gizzard, bacon, salmon, omelet, or \"croque-monsieur\", with or without soft-boiled egg and always with the traditional coffee/tea/chocolate along fruits or fruit juice. When the egg is cooked sunny-side over the \"croque-monsieur\", it is called a \"croque-madame\".\nIn \"Germinal\" and other novels, \u00c9mile Zola also reported the \"briquet\": two long bread slices stuffed with butter, cheese and or ham. It can be eaten as a standing/walking breakfast, or meant as a \"second\" one before lunch.\nIn the movie \"Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis\", Philippe Abrams (Kad Merad) and Antoine Bailleul (Dany Boon) share together countless breakfasts consisting of \"tartines de Maroilles\" (a rather strong cheese) along with their hot chicory.\nLunch.\n\"Le d\u00e9jeuner\" (lunch) is a two-hour mid-day meal or a one-hour lunch break. In some smaller towns and in the south of France, the two-hour lunch may still be customary. Sunday lunches are often longer and are taken with the family. Restaurants normally open for lunch at noon and close at 2:30\u00a0pm. Some restaurants are closed on Monday during lunch hours.\nIn large cities, a majority of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serves complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch to eat. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and \"traiteurs\"; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three courses of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, is eating sandwiches followed by a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets at budget prices.\nDinner.\n\"Le d\u00eener\" (dinner) often consists of three courses, \"hors d'\u0153uvre\" or \"entr\u00e9e\" (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), \"plat principal\" (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. Most of the time the bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30\u00a0pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00\u00a0pm and 11:00\u00a0pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.\nBeverages and drinks.\nIn French cuisine, beverages that precede a meal are called \"ap\u00e9ritifs\" (literally: \"that opens the appetite\"), and can be served with \"amuse-bouches\" (literally: \"mouth amuser\"). Those that end it are called \"digestifs\".\nThe \"ap\u00e9ritif\" varies from region to region: Pastis is popular in the south of France, Cr\u00e9mant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called \"Blanc-cassis\", is a common and popular \"ap\u00e9ritif\"-cocktail made with a measure of \"cr\u00e8me de cassis\" (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase \"Kir Royal\" is used when white wine is replaced with a \"Champagne\" wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an \"ap\u00e9ritif\", accompanied by \"amuse-bouches\". Some \"ap\u00e9ritifs\" can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.\n\"Digestifs\" are traditionally stronger, and include Cognac, Armagnac, Calvados, \"Eau de vie\" and fruit alcohols.\nChristmas.\nA typical French Christmas dish is turkey with chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and \"foie gras\". The Yule log is a very French tradition during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal in reference to the twelve apostles and Christ.\nFood establishments.\nHistory.\nThe modern restaurant has its origins in French culture. Prior to the late 18th century, diners who wished to \"dine out\" would visit their local guild member's kitchen and have their meal prepared for them. However, guild members were limited to producing whatever their guild registry delegated to them. These guild members offered food in their own homes to steady clientele that appeared day-to-day but at set times. The guest would be offered the meal \"table d'h\u00f4te\", which is a meal offered at a set price with very little choice of dishes, sometimes none at all.\nThe first steps toward the modern restaurant were locations that offered \"restorative\" bouillons, or \"restaurants\"\u2014these words being the origin of the name \"restaurant\". This step took place during the 1760s\u20131770s. These locations were open at all times of the day, featuring ornate tableware and reasonable prices. These locations were meant more as meal replacements for those who had \"lost their appetites and suffered from jaded palates and weak chests.\"\nIn 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, pastry chef to the future Louis XVIII, opened one of the most popular restaurants of the time\u2014the \"Grande Taverne de Londres\"\u2014in the arcades of the Palais-Royal. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing monarchy of France, in the period leading up to the French Revolution. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and the substantial discretionary income of the French Directory's \"nouveau riche\" helped keep these new restaurants in business.\nRestaurant staff.\nLarger restaurants and hotels in France employ extensive staff and are commonly referred to as either the \"kitchen brigade\" for the kitchen staff or \"dining room brigade\" system for the dining room staff. This system was created by Georges Auguste Escoffier. This structured team system delegates responsibilities to different individuals who specialize in certain tasks. The following is a list of positions held both in the kitchen and dining rooms brigades in France:"}

The five flavors of the spices (sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and umami (savoriness)) refers to the five traditional Chinese elements.\nIngredients.\nWhile there are many variants, a common mix is:\nOther recipes may contain anise seed, ginger root, nutmeg, turmeric, \"Amomum villosum\" pods (\"sh\u0101r\u00e9n\" ), \"Amomum cardamomum\" pods (\"b\u00e1id\u00f2uk\u00f2u\" ), licorice, Mandarin orange peel or galangal.\nIn Southern China, \"Cinnamomum loureiroi\" and Mandarin orange peel are commonly used as substitutes for \"Cinnamomum cassia\" and cloves respectively. These ingredients collectively produce southern five-spice powders' distinctive, slightly different flavor profile. In one study, the potential antioxidant capacities of Chinese five-spice powder (consisting of Szechuan pepper, fennel seed, cinnamon, star anise, and clove) with varying proportion of individual spice ingredients was investigated through four standard methods. The results suggest that clove is the major contributor to the high antioxidant capacities of the five-spice powder whereas the other four ingredients contribute to the flavor.\nUse.\nFive spice may be used with fatty meats such as pork, duck or goose. It is used as a spice rub for chicken, duck, pork and seafood, in red cooking recipes, or added to the breading for fried foods. Five spice is used in recipes for Cantonese roasted duck, as well as beef stew. It is used as a marinade for Vietnamese broiled chicken. The five-spice powder mixture has followed the Chinese diaspora and has been incorporated into other national cuisines throughout Asia.\nIn Hawaii, some restaurants place a shaker of the spice on each patron's table. A seasoned salt can be easily made by dry-roasting common salt with five-spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.\nFive-spice powder can also add complexity and savoriness to sweets and savory dishes alike. It has a traditional use as an antiseptic and used to cure indigestion. "}

It records information about the basic shape, or holes, of the topological space. The fundamental group is the first and simplest homotopy group. The fundamental group is a homotopy invariant\u2014topological spaces that are homotopy equivalent (or the stronger case of homeomorphic) have isomorphic fundamental groups.\nIntuition.\nStart with a space (for example, a surface), and some point in it, and all the loops both starting and ending at this point\u2014paths that start at this point, wander around and eventually return to the starting point. Two loops can be combined together in an obvious way: travel along the first loop, then along the second.\nTwo loops are considered equivalent if one can be deformed into the other without breaking. The set of all such loops with this method of combining and this equivalence between them is the fundamental group for that particular space.\nHistory.\nHenri Poincar\u00e9 defined the fundamental group in 1895 in his paper \"Analysis situs\". The concept emerged in the theory of Riemann surfaces, in the work of Bernhard Riemann, Poincar\u00e9, and Felix Klein. It describes the monodromy properties of complex-valued functions, as well as providing a complete topological classification of closed surfaces.\nDefinition.\nThroughout this article, \"X\" is a topological space. A typical example is a surface such as the one depicted at the right. Moreover, formula_1 is a point in \"X\" called the \"base-point\". (As is explained below, its role is rather auxiliary.) The idea of the definition of the homotopy group is to measure how many (broadly speaking) curves on \"X\" can be deformed into each other. The precise definition depends on the notion of the homotopy of loops, which is explained first.\nHomotopy of loops.\nGiven a topological space \"X\", a \"loop based at formula_1\" is defined to be a continuous function (also known as a continuous map)\nsuch that the starting point formula_4 and the end point formula_5 are both equal to formula_1.\nA \"homotopy\" is a continuous interpolation between two loops. More precisely, a homotopy between two loops formula_7 (based at the same point formula_1) is a continuous map\nsuch that\nIf such a homotopy \"h\" exists, formula_18 and formula_19 are said to be \"homotopic\". The relation \"formula_18 is homotopic to formula_19\" is an equivalence relation so that the set of equivalence classes can be considered:\nThis set (with the group structure described below) is called the \"fundamental group\" of the topological space \"X\" at the base point formula_1. The purpose of considering the equivalence classes of loops up to homotopy, as opposed to the set of all loops (the so-called loop space of \"X\") is that the latter, while being useful for various purposes, is a rather big and unwieldy object. By contrast the above quotient is, in many cases, more manageable and computable.\nGroup structure.\nBy the above definition, formula_24 is just a set. It becomes a group (and therefore deserves the name fundamental \"group\") using the concatenation of loops. More precisely, given two loops formula_25, their product is defined as the loop\nThus the loop formula_27 first follows the loop formula_28 with \"twice the speed\" and then follows formula_29 with \"twice the speed\".\nThe product of two homotopy classes of loops formula_30 and formula_31 is then defined as formula_32. It can be shown that this product does not depend on the choice of representatives and therefore gives a well-defined operation on the set formula_24. This operation turns formula_24 into a group. Its neutral element is the constant loop, which stays at formula_1 for all times \"t\". The inverse of a (homotopy class of a) loop is the same loop, but traversed in the opposite direction. More formally,\nGiven three based loops formula_37 the product\nis the concatenation of these loops, traversing formula_28 and then formula_29 with quadruple speed, and then formula_41 with double speed. By comparison,\ntraverses the same paths (in the same order), but formula_28 with double speed, and formula_44 with quadruple speed. Thus, because of the differing speeds, the two paths are not identical. The associativity axiom\ntherefore crucially depends on the fact that paths are considered up to homotopy. Indeed, both above composites are homotopic, for example, to the loop that traverses all three loops formula_46 with triple speed. The set of based loops up to homotopy, equipped with the above operation therefore does turn formula_24 into a group.\nDependence of the base point.\nAlthough the fundamental group in general depends on the choice of base point, it turns out that, up to isomorphism (actually, even up to \"inner\" isomorphism), this choice makes no difference as long as the space \"X\" is path-connected. For path-connected spaces, therefore, many authors write formula_48 instead of formula_24.\nConcrete examples.\nThis section lists some basic examples of fundamental groups. To begin with, in Euclidean space (formula_50) or any convex subset of formula_51 there is only one homotopy class of loops, and the fundamental group is therefore the trivial group with one element. More generally, any star domain and, yet more generally any contractible space has a trivial fundamental group. Thus, the fundamental group does not distinguish between such spaces. \nThe 2-sphere.\nA path-connected space whose fundamental group is trivial is called simply connected. \nFor example, the 2-sphere formula_52 depicted on the right, and also all the higher-dimensional spheres are simply-connected. The figure illustrates a homotopy contracting one particular loop to the constant loop. This idea can be adapted to all loops formula_18 such that there is a point formula_54 that is in the image of formula_55 However, since there are loops such that formula_56 (constructed from the Peano curve, for example), a complete proof requires more careful analysis with tools from algebraic topology, such as the Seifert\u2013van Kampen theorem or the cellular approximation theorem.\nThe circle.\nThe circle (also known as the 1-sphere)\nis not simply connected. Instead, each homotopy class consists of all loops that wind around the circle a given number of times (which can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of winding). The product of a loop that winds around \"m\" times and another that winds around \"n\" times is a loop that winds around formula_58 times. Therefore, the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to formula_59 the additive group of integers. This fact can be used to give proofs of the Brouwer fixed point theorem and the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem in dimension 2.\nThe figure eight.\nThe fundamental group of the figure eight is the free group on two letters. The idea to prove this is as follows: choosing the base point to be the point where the two circles meet (dotted in black in the picture at the right), any loop formula_18 can be decomposed as\nwhere \"a\" and \"b\" are the two loops winding around each half of the figure as depicted, and the exponents formula_62 are integers. Unlike formula_63 the fundamental group of the figure eight is \"not\" abelian: the two ways of composing \"a\" and \"b\" are not homotopic to each other:\nMore generally, the fundamental group of a bouquet of \"r\" circles is the free group on \"r\" letters. \nThe fundamental group of a wedge sum of two path connected spaces \"X\" and \"Y\" can be computed as the free product of the individual fundamental groups:\nThis generalizes the above observations since the figure eight is the wedge sum of two circles.\nThe fundamental group of the plane punctured at \"n\" points is also the free group with \"n\" generators. The \"i\"-th generator is the class of the loop that goes around the \"i\"-th puncture without going around any other punctures.\nGraphs.\nThe fundamental group can be defined for discrete structures too. In particular, consider a connected graph , with a designated vertex \"v\"0 in \"V\". The loops in \"G\" are the cycles that start and end at \"v0\". Let \"T\" be a spanning tree of \"G\". Every simple loop in \"G\" contains exactly one edge in \"E\" \\ \"T\"; every loop in \"G\" is a concatenation of such simple loops. Therefore, the fundamental group of a graph is a free group, in which the number of generators is exactly the number of edges in \"E\" \\ \"T\". This number equals . \nFor example, suppose \"G\" has 16 vertices arranged in 4 rows of 4 vertices each, with edges connecting vertices that are adjacent horizontally or vertically. Then \"G\" has 24 edges overall, and the number of edges in each spanning tree is , so the fundamental group of \"G\" is the free group with 9 generators. Note that \"G\" has 9 \"holes\", similarly to a bouquet of 9 circles, which has the same fundamental group.\nKnot groups.\n\"Knot groups\" are, by definition the fundamental group of the complement of a knot \"K\" embedded in formula_66 For example, the knot group of the trefoil knot is known to be the braid group formula_67 which gives another example of a non-abelian fundamental group. The Wirtinger presentation explicitly describes knot groups in terms of generators and relations based on a diagram of the knot. Therefore knot groups have some usage in knot theory to distinguish between knots: if formula_68 is not isomorphic to some other knot group formula_69 of another knot \"K\"', then \"K\" can not be transformed into formula_70 Thus the trefoil knot can not be continuously transformed into the circle (also known as the unknot), since the latter has knot group formula_71. There are, however, knots that can not be deformed into each other, but have isomorphic knot groups.\nOriented surfaces.\nThe fundamental group of a genus \"n\" orientable surface can be computed in terms of generators and relations as\nThis includes the torus, being the case of genus 1, whose fundamental group is\nTopological groups.\nThe fundamental group of a topological group \"X\" (with respect to the base point being the neutral element) is always commutative. In particular, the fundamental group of a Lie group is commutative. In fact, the group structure on \"X\" endows formula_48 with another group structure: given two loops formula_18 and formula_19 in \"X\", another loop formula_77 can defined by using the group multiplication in \"X\": \nThis binary operation formula_79 on the set of all loops is \"a priori\" independent from the one described above. However, the Eckmann\u2013Hilton argument shows that it does in fact agree with the above concatenation of loops, and moreover that the resulting group structure is abelian. \nAn inspection of the proof shows that, more generally, formula_48 is abelian for any H-space \"X\", i.e., the multiplication need not have an inverse, nor does it have to be associative. For example, this shows that the fundamental group of a loop space of another topological space \"Y\", formula_81 is abelian. Related ideas lead to Heinz Hopf's computation of the cohomology of a Lie group.\nFunctoriality.\nIf formula_82 is a continuous map, formula_83 and formula_84 with formula_85 then every loop in \"X\" with base point formula_1 can be composed with \"f\" to yield a loop in \"Y\" with base point formula_87 This operation is compatible with the homotopy equivalence relation and with composition of loops. The resulting group homomorphism, called the induced homomorphism, is written as formula_88 or, more commonly,\nThis mapping from continuous maps to group homomorphisms is compatible with composition of maps and identity morphisms. In the parlance of category theory, the formation of associating to a topological space its fundamental group is therefore a functor\nfrom the category of topological spaces together with a base point to the category of groups. It turns out that this functor does not distinguish maps that are homotopic relative to the base point: if \"f\", \"g\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\" are continuous maps with \"f\"(\"x\"0) = \"g\"(\"x\"0) = \"y\"0, and \"f\" and \"g\" are homotopic relative to {\"x\"0}, then \"f\"\u2217 = \"g\"\u2217. As a consequence, two homotopy equivalent path-connected spaces have isomorphic fundamental groups:\nFor example, the inclusion of the circle in the punctured plane\nis a homotopy equivalence and therefore yields an isomorphism of their fundamental groups.\nThe fundamental group functor takes products to products and coproducts to coproducts. That is, if \"X\" and \"Y\" are path connected, then\nAbstract results.\nAs was mentioned above, computing the fundamental group of even relatively simple topological spaces tends to be not entirely trivial, but requires some methods of algebraic topology. \nRelationship to first homology group.\nThe abelianization of the fundamental group can be identified with the first homology group of the space. \nA special case of the Hurewicz theorem asserts that the first singular homology group formula_94 is, colloquially speaking, the closest approximation to the fundamental group by means of an abelian group. In more detail, mapping the homotopy class of each loop to the homology class of the loop gives a group homomorphism\nfrom the fundamental group of a topological space \"X\" to its first singular homology group formula_96 This homomorphism is not in general an isomorphism since the fundamental group may be non-abelian, but the homology group is, by definition, always abelian. This difference is, however, the only one: if \"X\" is path-connected, this homomorphism is surjective and its kernel is the commutator subgroup of the fundamental group, so that formula_94 is isomorphic to the abelianization of the fundamental group.\nGlueing topological spaces.\nGeneralizing the statement above, for a family of path connected spaces formula_98 the fundamental group formula_99 is the free product of the fundamental groups of the formula_100 This fact is a special case of the Seifert\u2013van Kampen theorem, which allows to compute, more generally, fundamental groups of spaces that are glued together from other spaces. For example, the 2-sphere formula_101 can be obtained by glueing two copies of slightly overlapping half-spheres along a neighborhood of the equator. In this case the theorem yields formula_102 is trivial, since the two half-spheres are contractible and therefore have trivial fundamental group. The fundamental groups of surfaces, as mentioned above, can also be computed using this theorem.\nIn the parlance of category theory, the theorem can be concisely stated by saying that the fundamental group functor takes pushouts (in the category of topological spaces) along inclusions to pushouts (in the category of groups).\nCoverings.\nGiven a topological space \"B\", a continuous map \nis called a \"covering\" or \"E\" is called a \"covering space\" of \"B\" if every point \"b\" in \"B\" admits an open neighborhood \"U\" such that there is a homeomorphism between the preimage of \"U\" and a disjoint union of copies of \"U\" (indexed by some set \"I\"),\nin such a way that formula_105 is the standard projection map formula_106\nUniversal covering.\nA covering is called a universal covering if \"E\" is, in addition to the preceding condition, simply connected. It is universal in the sense that all other coverings can be constructed by suitably identifying points in \"E\". Knowing a universal covering \nof a topological space \"X\" is helpful in understanding its fundamental group in several ways: first, formula_48 identifies with the group of deck transformations, i.e., the group of homeomorphisms formula_109 that commute with the map to \"X\", i.e., formula_110\nAnother relation to the fundamental group is that formula_111 can be identified with the fiber formula_112 For example, the map\n(or, equivalently, formula_114) is a universal covering. The deck transformations are the maps formula_115 for formula_116 This is in line with the identification formula_117 in particular this proves the above claim formula_118\nAny path connected, locally path connected and locally simply connected topological space \"X\" admits a universal covering. An abstract construction proceeds analogously to the fundamental group by taking pairs (\"x\",\u00a0\u03b3), where \"x\" is a point in \"X\" and \u03b3 is a homotopy class of paths from \"x\"0 to \"x\". The passage from a topological space to its universal covering can be used in understanding the geometry of \"X\". For example, the uniformization theorem shows that any simply connected Riemann surface is (isomorphic to) either formula_119 formula_120 or the upper half plane. General Riemann surfaces then arise as quotients of group actions on these three surfaces.\nThe quotient of an action of a (discrete) group \"G\" on a simply connected space \"Y\" has fundamental group \nAs an example, the real \"n\"-dimensional real projective space formula_122 is obtained as the quotient of the \"n\"-dimensional sphere formula_123 by the antipodal action of the group formula_124 sending formula_125 to formula_126 As formula_123 is simply connected for \"n\" \u2265 2, it is a universal cover of formula_122 in these cases, which implies formula_129 for \"n\" \u2265 2.\nLie groups.\nLet \"G\" be a connected, simply connected compact Lie group, for example, the special unitary group SU(\"n\"), and let \u0393 be a finite subgroup of \"G\". Then the homogeneous space \"X\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"G\"/\u0393 has fundamental group \u0393, which acts by right multiplication on the universal covering space \"G\". Among the many variants of this construction, one of the most important is given by locally symmetric spaces \"X\"\u00a0=\u00a0\u0393\\\"G\"/\"K\", where\nIn this case the fundamental group is \u0393 and the universal covering space \"G\"/\"K\" is actually contractible (by the Cartan decomposition for Lie groups).\nAs an example take \"G\"\u00a0=\u00a0SL(2, R), \"K\"\u00a0=\u00a0SO(2) and \u0393 any torsion-free congruence subgroup of the modular group SL(2, Z).\nFrom the explicit realization, it also follows that the universal covering space of a path connected topological group \"H\" is again a path connected topological group \"G\". Moreover, the covering map is a continuous open homomorphism of \"G\" onto \"H\" with kernel \u0393, a closed discrete normal subgroup of \"G\":\nSince \"G\" is a connected group with a continuous action by conjugation on a discrete group \u0393, it must act trivially, so that \u0393 has to be a subgroup of the center of \"G\". In particular \u03c01(\"H\") = \u0393 is an abelian group; this can also easily be seen directly without using covering spaces. The group \"G\" is called the \"universal covering group\" of\u00a0\"H\".\nAs the universal covering group suggests, there is an analogy between the fundamental group of a topological group and the center of a group; this is elaborated at Lattice of covering groups.\nFibrations.\n\"Fibrations\" provide a very powerful means to compute homotopy groups. A fibration \"f\" the so-called \"total space\", and the base space \"B\" has, in particular, the property that all its fibers formula_131 are homotopy equivalent and therefore can not be distinguished using fundamental groups (and higher homotopy groups), provided that \"B\" is path-connected. Therefore, the space \"E\" can be regarded as a \"twisted product\" of the base space \"B\" and the fiber formula_132 The great importance of fibrations to the computation of homotopy groups stems from a long exact sequence\nprovided that \"B\" is path-connected. The term formula_134 is the second homotopy group of \"B\", which is defined to be the set of homotopy classes of maps from formula_101 to \"B\", in direct analogy with the definition of formula_136\nIf \"E\" happens to be path-connected and simply connected, this sequence reduces to an isomorphism\nwhich generalizes the above fact about the universal covering (which amounts to the case where the fiber \"F\" is also discrete). If instead \"F\" happens to be connected and simply connected, it reduces to an isomorphism\nWhat is more, the sequence can be continued at the left with the higher homotopy groups formula_139 of the three spaces, which gives some access to computing such groups in the same vein.\nClassical Lie groups.\nSuch fiber sequences can be used to inductively compute fundamental groups of compact classical Lie groups such as the special unitary group formula_140 with formula_141 This group acts transitively on the unit sphere formula_142 inside formula_143 The stabilizer of a point in the sphere is isomorphic to formula_144 It then can be shown that this yields a fiber sequence\nSince formula_146 the sphere formula_142 has dimension at least 3, which implies \nThe long exact sequence then shows an isomorphism\nSince formula_150 is a single point, so that formula_151 is trivial, this shows that formula_152 is simply connected for all formula_153\nThe fundamental group of noncompact Lie groups can be reduced to the compact case, since such a group is homotopic to its maximal compact subgroup. These methods give the following results:\nA second method of computing fundamental groups applies to all connected compact Lie groups and uses the machinery of the maximal torus and the associated root system. Specifically, let formula_154 be a maximal torus in a connected compact Lie group formula_155 and let formula_156 be the Lie algebra of formula_157 The exponential map\nis a fibration and therefore its kernel formula_159 identifies with formula_160 The map\ncan be shown to be surjective with kernel given by the set \"I\" of integer linear combination of coroots. This leads to the computation \nThis method shows, for example, that any connected compact Lie group for which the associated root system is of type formula_163 is simply connected. Thus, there is (up to isomorphism) only one connected compact Lie group having Lie algebra of type formula_163; this group is simply connected and has trivial center.\nEdge-path group of a simplicial complex.\nWhen the topological space is homeomorphic to a simplicial complex, its fundamental group can be described explicitly in terms of generators and relations.\nIf \"X\" is a connected simplicial complex, an \"edge-path\" in \"X\" is defined to be a chain of vertices connected by edges in \"X\". Two edge-paths are said to be \"edge-equivalent\" if one can be obtained from the other by successively switching between an edge and the two opposite edges of a triangle in \"X\". If \"v\" is a fixed vertex in \"X\", an \"edge-loop\" at \"v\" is an edge-path starting and ending at \"v\". The edge-path group \"E\"(\"X\",\u00a0\"v\") is defined to be the set of edge-equivalence classes of edge-loops at \"v\", with product and inverse defined by concatenation and reversal of edge-loops.\nThe edge-path group is naturally isomorphic to \u03c01(|\"X\"|,\u00a0\"v\"), the fundamental group of the geometric realisation |\"X\"| of \"X\". Since it depends only on the 2-skeleton \"X\"2 of \"X\" (that is, the vertices, edges, and triangles of \"X\"), the groups \u03c01(|\"X\"|,\"v\") and \u03c01(|\"X\"2|,\u00a0\"v\") are isomorphic.\nThe edge-path group can be described explicitly in terms of generators and relations. If \"T\" is a maximal spanning tree in the 1-skeleton of \"X\", then \"E\"(\"X\",\u00a0\"v\") is canonically isomorphic to the group with generators (the oriented edge-paths of \"X\" not occurring in \"T\") and relations (the edge-equivalences corresponding to triangles in \"X\"). A similar result holds if \"T\" is replaced by any simply connected\u2014in particular contractible\u2014subcomplex of \"X\". This often gives a practical way of computing fundamental groups and can be used to show that every finitely presented group arises as the fundamental group of a finite simplicial complex. It is also one of the classical methods used for topological surfaces, which are classified by their fundamental groups.\nThe \"universal covering space\" of a finite connected simplicial complex \"X\" can also be described directly as a simplicial complex using edge-paths. Its vertices are pairs (\"w\",\u03b3) where \"w\" is a vertex of \"X\" and \u03b3 is an edge-equivalence class of paths from \"v\" to \"w\". The \"k\"-simplices containing (\"w\",\u03b3) correspond naturally to the \"k\"-simplices containing \"w\". Each new vertex \"u\" of the \"k\"-simplex gives an edge \"wu\" and hence, by concatenation, a new path \u03b3\"u\" from \"v\" to \"u\". The points (\"w\",\u03b3) and (\"u\", \u03b3\"u\") are the vertices of the \"transported\" simplex in the universal covering space. The edge-path group acts naturally by concatenation, preserving the simplicial structure, and the quotient space is just \"X\".\nIt is well known that this method can also be used to compute the fundamental group of an arbitrary topological space. This was doubtless known to Eduard \u010cech and Jean Leray and explicitly appeared as a remark in a paper by Andr\u00e9 Weil; various other authors such as Lorenzo Calabi, Wu Wen-ts\u00fcn, and Nodar Berikashvili have also published proofs. In the simplest case of a compact space \"X\" with a finite open covering in which all non-empty finite intersections of open sets in the covering are contractible, the fundamental group can be identified with the edge-path group of the simplicial complex corresponding to the nerve of the covering.\nRelated concepts.\nHigher homotopy groups.\nRoughly speaking, the fundamental group detects the 1-dimensional hole structure of a space, but not holes in higher dimensions such as for the 2-sphere. Such \"higher-dimensional holes\" can be detected using the higher homotopy groups formula_165, which are defined to consist of homotopy classes of (basepoint-preserving) maps from formula_123 to \"X\". For example, the Hurewicz theorem implies that the \"n\"-th homotopy group of the \"n\"-sphere is (for all formula_167) are\nAs was mentioned in the above computation of formula_169 of classical Lie groups, higher homotopy groups can be relevant even for computing fundamental groups.\nLoop space.\nThe set of based loops (as is, i.e., not taken up to homotopy) in a pointed space \"X\", endowed with the compact open topology, is known as the loop space, denoted formula_170 The fundamental group of \"X\" is in bijection with the set of path components of its loop space:\nFundamental groupoid.\nThe \"fundamental groupoid\" is a variant of the fundamental group that is useful in situations where the choice of a base point formula_83 is undesirable. It is defined by first considering the category of paths in formula_173 i.e., continuous functions\nwhere \"r\" is an arbitrary non-negative real number. Since the length \"r\" is variable in this approach, such paths can be concatenated as is (i.e., not up to homotopy) and therefore yield a category. Two such paths formula_175 with the same endpoints and length \"r\", resp. \"r\"' are considered equivalent if there exist real numbers formula_176 such that formula_177 and formula_178 are homotopic relative to their end points, where formula_179 The category of paths up to this equivalence relation is denoted formula_180 Each morphism in formula_181 is an isomorphism, with inverse given by the same path traversed in the opposite direction. Such a category is called a groupoid. It reproduces the fundamental group since\nMore generally, one can consider the fundamental groupoid on a set \"A\" of base points, chosen according to the geometry of the situation; for example, in the case of the circle, which can be represented as the union of two connected open sets whose intersection has two components, one can choose one base point in each component. The van Kampen theorem admits a version for fundamental groupoids which gives, for example, another way to compute the fundamental group(oid) of formula_183\nLocal systems.\nGenerally speaking, representations may serve to exhibit features of a group by its actions on other mathematical objects, often vector spaces. Representations of the fundamental group have a very geometric significance: any \"local system\" (i.e., a sheaf formula_184 on \"X\" with the property that locally in a sufficiently small neighborhood \"U\" of any point on \"X\", the restriction of \"F\" is a constant sheaf of the form formula_185) gives rise to the so-called monodromy representation, a representation of the fundamental group on an \"n\"-dimensional formula_186-vector space. Conversely, any such representation on a path-connected space \"X\" arises in this manner. This equivalence of categories between representations of formula_48 and local systems is used, for example, in the study of differential equations, such as the Knizhnik\u2013Zamolodchikov equations.\n\u00c9tale fundamental group.\nIn algebraic geometry, the so-called \u00e9tale fundamental group is used as a replacement for the fundamental group. Since the Zariski topology on an algebraic variety or scheme \"X\" is much coarser than, say, the topology of open subsets in formula_51 it is no longer meaningful to consider continuous maps from an interval to \"X\". Instead, the approach developed by Grothendieck consists in constructing formula_189 by considering all finite \u00e9tale covers of \"X\". These serve as an algebro-geometric analogue of coverings with finite fibers. \nThis yields a theory applicable in situation where no great generality classical topological intuition whatsoever is available, for example for varieties defined over a finite field. Also, the \u00e9tale fundamental group of a field is its (absolute) Galois group. On the other hand, for smooth varieties \"X\" over the complex numbers, the \u00e9tale fundamental group retains much of the information inherent in the classical fundamental group: the former is the profinite completion of the latter.\nFundamental group of algebraic groups.\nThe fundamental group of a root system is defined, in analogy to the computation for Lie groups. This allows to define and use the fundamental group of a semisimple linear algebraic group \"G\", which is a useful basic tool in the classification of linear algebraic groups.\nFundamental group of simplicial sets.\nThe homotopy relation between 1-simplices of a simplicial set \"X\" is an equivalence relation if \"X\" is a Kan complex but not necessarily so in general. Thus, formula_169 of a Kan complex can be defined as the set of homotopy classes of 1-simplices. The fundamental group of an arbitrary simplicial set \"X\" are defined to be the homotopy group of its topological realization, formula_191 i.e., the topological space obtained by glueing topological simplices as prescribed by the simplicial set structure of \"X\"."}

Language features include structured programming, reflection (the ability to examine and modify program structure during execution), concatenative programming (functions are composed with juxtaposition) and extensibility (the programmer can create new commands). Although not an acronym, the language's name is sometimes spelled with all capital letters as FORTH, following the customary usage during its earlier years.\nA procedural programming language without type checking, Forth features both interactive execution of commands (making it suitable as a shell for systems that lack a more formal operating system) and the ability to compile sequences of commands for later execution. For much of Forth's existence, the standard technique was to compile to threaded code, but there are modern implementations that generate optimized machine code like other language compilers.\nForth is used in the Open Firmware boot loader, in space applications such as the Philae spacecraft, and in other embedded systems which involve interaction with hardware. The bestselling 1986 computer game \"Starflight\", from Electronic Arts, was written with a custom Forth.\nThe free software Gforth implementation is actively maintained, as are several commercially supported systems.\nOverview.\nForth is a simple, yet extensible language; its modularity and extensibility permit writing significant programs.\nA Forth environment combines the compiler with an interactive shell, where the user defines and runs subroutines called \"words\". Words can be interactively defined, tested, redefined, and debugged without recompiling or restarting the whole program. All syntactic elements, including variables and basic operators, are defined as words. Ideally running the program has the same effect as manually re-entering the source.\nThe Forth philosophy emphasizes the use of small, simple words. Words for bigger tasks call upon many smaller words that each accomplish a distinct sub-task. A large Forth program is a hierarchy of words. These words, being distinct modules that communicate (pass data) implicitly via a stack mechanism, can be prototyped, built and tested independently. The highest level of Forth code may resemble an English-language description of the application. Forth has been called a \u201cmeta-application language\u201d: a language that can be used to create problem-oriented languages.\nUses.\nForth has been used successfully in large, complex projects, while applications developed by competent, disciplined professionals have proven to be easily maintained on evolving hardware platforms over decades of use. Forth has a niche both in astronomical and space applications. Forth is still used in some embedded systems because of its portability, efficient memory use, short development times, and high execution speed. It has been implemented efficiently on modern reduced instruction set computers, and processors that use Forth as machine language have been produced. Other uses of Forth include the Open Firmware boot ROMs used by Apple, IBM, Sun, and OLPC XO-1.\nHistory.\nForth evolved from Charles H. Moore's personal programming system, which had been in continuous development since 1968. Forth was first exposed to other programmers in the early 1970s, starting with Elizabeth Rather at the United States National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). After their work at NRAO, Charles Moore and Elizabeth Rather formed FORTH, Inc. in 1973, refining and porting Forth systems to dozens of other platforms in the next decade.\nForth is so-named, because in 1968 \"the file holding the interpreter was labeled FOURTH, for 4th (next) generation software, but the IBM 1130 operating system restricted file names to five characters.\" Moore saw Forth as a successor to compile-link-go third-generation programming languages, or software for \"fourth generation\" hardware.\nA Forth system has often been used to bring up new hardware. For example, Forth was the first resident software on the new Intel 8086 chip in 1978 and MacFORTH was the first resident development system for the 128K Macintosh in 1984.\nFORTH, Inc.'s microFORTH was developed for the Intel 8080, Motorola 6800, Zilog Z80, and RCA 1802 microprocessors, starting in 1976. MicroFORTH was later used by hobbyists to generate Forth systems for other architectures, such as the 6502 in 1978. Common practice was codified in the de facto standards FORTH-79 and FORTH-83 in the years 1979 and 1983, respectively. These standards were unified by ANSI in 1994, commonly referred to as Forth.\nForth became popular in the early 1980s because it was well suited to the limited memory of microcomputers. The ease of implementing the language led to many implementations. The British Jupiter ACE home computer has Forth in its ROM-resident operating system. Insoft GraFORTH is a version of Forth with graphics extensions for the Apple II.\nThe Canon Cat used Forth for its system programming, and Rockwell produced single-chip microcomputers with resident Forth kernels, the R65F11 and R65F12. ASYST was a Forth expansion for measuring and controlling on PCs.\nAs of 2018, the source for the original 1130 version of FORTH has been recovered, and is now being updated to run on a restored or emulated 1130 system.\nProgrammer's perspective.\nForth relies on explicit use of a data stack and reverse Polish notation which is commonly used in calculators from Hewlett-Packard. In RPN, the operator is placed after its operands, as opposed to the more common infix notation where the operator is placed between its operands. Postfix notation makes the language easier to parse and extend; Forth's flexibility makes a static BNF grammar inappropriate, and it does not have a monolithic compiler. Extending the compiler only requires writing a new word, instead of modifying a grammar and changing the underlying implementation.\nUsing RPN, one can get the result of the mathematical expression codice_1 this way:\n 25 10 * 50 + CR .\n 300 ok\nFirst the numbers 25 and 10 are put on the stack.\n&lt;br&gt;The word codice_2 takes the top two numbers from the stack, multiplies them, and puts the product back on the stack.\nThen the number 50 is placed on the stack.\n&lt;br&gt;The word codice_3 adds the top two values, pushing the sum. codice_4 (carriage return) starts the output on a new line. Finally, codice_5 prints the result. As everything has completed successfully, the Forth system prints codice_6.\nEven Forth's structural features are stack-based. For example:\n : FLOOR5 ( n -- n' ) DUP 6 &lt; IF DROP 5 ELSE 1 - THEN ;\nThe colon indicates the beginning of a new definition, in this case a new word (again, \"word\" is the term used for a subroutine) called codice_7. The text in parentheses is a comment, advising that this word expects a number on the stack and will return a possibly changed number (on the stack).\nThe subroutine uses the following commands: codice_8 duplicates the number on the stack; codice_9 pushes a 6 on top of the stack; codice_10 compares the top two numbers on the stack (6 and the codice_8ed input), and replaces them with a true-or-false value; codice_12 takes a true-or-false value and chooses to execute commands immediately after it or to skip to the codice_13; codice_14 discards the value on the stack; codice_15 pushes a 5 on top of the stack; and codice_16 ends the conditional.\nThe codice_7 word is equivalent to this function written in the C programming language using the '?:'\nint floor5(int v) {\n return (v &lt; 6) ? 5 : (v - 1);\nThis function is written more succinctly as:\n : FLOOR5 ( n -- n' ) 1- 5 MAX ;\nThis can be run as follows:\n 1 FLOOR5 CR .\n 5 ok\n 8 FLOOR5 CR .\n 7 ok\nFirst a number (1 or 8) is pushed onto the stack, codice_7 is called, which pops the number again and pushes the result. codice_4 moves the output to a new line (again, this is only here for readability). Finally, a call to codice_5 pops the result and prints.\nFacilities.\nForth's grammar has no official specification. Instead, it is defined by a simple algorithm. The interpreter reads a line of input from the user input device, which is then parsed for a word using spaces as a delimiter; some systems recognise additional whitespace characters. When the interpreter finds a word, it looks the word up in the \"dictionary\". If the word is found, the interpreter executes the code associated with the word, and then returns to parse the rest of the input stream. If the word isn't found, the word is assumed to be a number and an attempt is made to convert it into a number and push it on the stack; if successful, the interpreter continues parsing the input stream. Otherwise, if both the lookup and the number conversion fail, the interpreter prints the word followed by an error message indicating that the word is not recognised, flushes the input stream, and waits for new user input.\nThe definition of a new word is started with the word codice_21 (colon) and ends with the word codice_22 (semi-colon). For example,\n : X DUP 1+ . . ;\nwill compile the word codice_23, and makes the name findable in the dictionary. When executed by typing codice_24 at the console this will print codice_25.\nMost Forth systems include an assembler that allows one to specify words using the processor's facilities at its lowest level. Mostly the assembler is tucked away in a separate namespace (\"wordlist\") as relatively few users want to use it. Forth assemblers may use a reverse-polish syntax in which the parameters of an instruction precede the instruction, but designs vary widely and are specific to the Forth implementation. A typical reverse-polish assembler prepares the operands on the stack and have the mnemonic copy the whole instruction into memory as the last step. A Forth assembler is by nature a macro assembler, so that it is easy to define an alias for registers according to their role in the Forth system: e.g. \"datastackpointer\" for the register used as a stack pointer.\nOperating system, files, and multitasking.\nMost Forth systems run under a host operating system such as Microsoft Windows, Linux or a version of Unix and use the host operating system's file system for source and data files; the ANSI Forth Standard describes the words used for I/O. All modern Forth systems use normal text files for source, even if they are embedded. An embedded system with a resident compiler gets its source via a serial line.\nClassic Forth systems traditionally use neither operating system nor file system. Instead of storing code in files, source code is stored in disk blocks written to physical disk addresses. The word codice_26 is employed to translate the number of a 1K-sized block of disk space into the address of a buffer containing the data, which is managed automatically by the Forth system. Block use has become rare since the mid-1990s. In a hosted system those blocks too are allocated in a normal file in any case.\nMultitasking, most commonly cooperative round-robin scheduling, is normally available (although multitasking words and support are not covered by the ANSI Forth Standard). The word codice_27 is used to save the current task's execution context, to locate the next task, and restore its execution context. Each task has its own stacks, private copies of some control variables and a scratch area. Swapping tasks is simple and efficient; as a result, Forth multitaskers are available even on very simple microcontrollers, such as the Intel 8051, Atmel AVR, and TI MSP430.\nOther non-standard facilities include a mechanism for issuing calls to the host OS or windowing systems, and many provide extensions that employ the scheduling provided by the operating system. Typically they have a larger and different set of words from the stand-alone Forth's codice_27 word for task creation, suspension, destruction and modification of priority.\nSelf-compilation and cross compilation.\nA full-featured Forth system with all source code will compile itself, a technique commonly called meta-compilation or self-hosting, by Forth programmers (although the term doesn't exactly match meta-compilation as it is normally defined). The usual method is to redefine the handful of words that place compiled bits into memory. The compiler's words use specially named versions of fetch and store that can be redirected to a buffer area in memory. The buffer area simulates or accesses a memory area beginning at a different address than the code buffer. Such compilers define words to access both the target computer's memory, and the host (compiling) computer's memory.\nAfter the fetch and store operations are redefined for the code space, the compiler, assembler, etc. are recompiled using the new definitions of fetch and store. This effectively reuses all the code of the compiler and interpreter. Then, the Forth system's code is compiled, but this version is stored in the buffer. The buffer in memory is written to disk, and ways are provided to load it temporarily into memory for testing. When the new version appears to work, it is written over the previous version.\nNumerous variations of such compilers exist for different environments. For embedded systems, the code may instead be written to another computer, a technique known as cross compilation, over a serial port or even a single TTL bit, while keeping the word names and other non-executing parts of the dictionary in the original compiling computer. The minimum definitions for such a Forth compiler are the words that fetch and store a byte, and the word that commands a Forth word to be executed. Often the most time-consuming part of writing a remote port is constructing the initial program to implement fetch, store and execute, but many modern microprocessors have integrated debugging features (such as the Motorola CPU32) that eliminate this task.\nStructure of the language.\nThe basic data structure of Forth is the \"dictionary\" which maps \"words\" to executable code or named data structures. The dictionary is laid out in memory as a tree of linked lists with the links proceeding from the latest (most recently) defined word to the oldest, until a sentinel value, usually a NULL pointer, is found. A context switch causes a list search to start at a different leaf. A linked list search continues as the branch merges into the main trunk leading eventually back to the sentinel, the root.\nThere can be several dictionaries. In rare cases such as meta-compilation a dictionary might be isolated and stand-alone.\nThe effect resembles that of nesting namespaces and can overload keywords depending on the context.\nA defined word generally consists of \"head\" and \"body\" with the head consisting of the \"name field\" (NF) and the \"link field\" (LF), and body consisting of the \"code field\" (CF) and the \"parameter field\" (PF).\nHead and body of a dictionary entry are treated separately because they may not be contiguous. For example, when a Forth program is recompiled for a new platform, the head may remain on the compiling computer, while the body goes to the new platform. In some environments (such as embedded systems) the heads occupy memory unnecessarily. However, some cross-compilers may put heads in the target if the target itself is expected to support an interactive Forth.\nDictionary entry.\nThe exact format of a dictionary entry is not prescribed, and implementations vary. However, certain components are almost always present, though the exact size and order may vary. Described as a structure, a dictionary entry might look this way:\n structure\n byte: flag \\ 3bit flags + length of word's name\n char-array: name \\ name's runtime length isn't known at compile time\n address: previous \\ link field, backward ptr to previous word\n address: codeword \\ ptr to the code to execute this word\n any-array: parameterfield \\ unknown length of data, words, or opcodes\n end-structure forthword\nThe name field starts with a prefix giving the length of the word's name (typically up to 32 bytes), and several bits for flags. The character representation of the word's name then follows the prefix. Depending on the particular implementation of Forth, there may be one or more NUL ('\\0') bytes for alignment.\nThe link field contains a pointer to the previously defined word. The pointer may be a relative displacement or an absolute address that points to the next oldest sibling.\nThe code field pointer will be either the address of the word which will execute the code or data in the parameter field or the beginning of machine code that the processor will execute directly. For colon defined words, the code field pointer points to the word that will save the current Forth instruction pointer (IP) on the return stack, and load the IP with the new address from which to continue execution of words. This is the same as what a processor's call/return instructions do.\nStructure of the compiler.\nThe compiler itself is not a monolithic program. It consists of Forth words visible to the system, and usable by a programmer. This allows a programmer to change the compiler's words for special purposes.\nThe \"compile time\" flag in the name field is set for words with \"compile time\" behavior. Most simple words execute the same code whether they are typed on a command line, or embedded in code. When compiling these, the compiler simply places code or a threaded pointer to the word.\nThe classic examples of compile-time words are the control structures such as codice_12 and codice_30. Almost all of Forth's control structures and almost all of its compiler are implemented as compile-time words. Apart from some rarely used control flow words only found in a few implementations, such as a conditional return, all of Forth's control flow words are executed during compilation to compile various combinations of primitive words along with their branch addresses. For instance, codice_12 and codice_30, and the words that match with those, set up codice_33 (unconditional branch) and codice_34 (pop a value off the stack, and branch if it is false). Counted loop control flow words work similarly but set up combinations of primitive words that work with a counter, and so on. During compilation, the data stack is used to support control structure balancing, nesting, and back-patching of branch addresses. The snippet:\n ... DUP 6 &lt; IF DROP 5 ELSE 1 - THEN ...\nwould be compiled to the following sequence inside a definition:\n ... DUP LIT 6 &lt; ?BRANCH 5 DROP LIT 5 BRANCH 3 LIT 1 - ...\nThe numbers after codice_33 represent relative jump addresses. codice_36 is the primitive word for pushing a \"literal\" number onto the data stack.\nCompilation state and interpretation state.\nThe word codice_21 (colon) parses a name as a parameter, creates a dictionary entry (a \"colon definition\") and enters compilation state. The interpreter continues to read space-delimited words from the user input device. If a word is found, the interpreter executes the \"compilation semantics\" associated with the word, instead of the \"interpretation semantics\". The default compilation semantics of a word are to append its interpretation semantics to the current definition.\nThe word codice_22 (semi-colon) finishes the current definition and returns to interpretation state. It is an example of a word whose compilation semantics differ from the default. The interpretation semantics of codice_22 (semi-colon), most control flow words, and several other words are undefined in Forth, meaning that they must only be used inside of definitions and not on the interactive command line.\nThe interpreter state can be changed manually with the words codice_40 (left-bracket) and codice_41 (right-bracket) which enter interpretation state or compilation state, respectively. These words can be used with the word codice_42 to calculate a value during a compilation and to insert the calculated value into the current colon definition. codice_42 has the compilation semantics to take an object from the data stack and to append semantics to the current colon definition to place that object on the data stack.\nIn Forth, the current state of the interpreter can be read from the flag codice_44 which contains the value true when in compilation state and false otherwise. This allows the implementation of so-called \"state-smart words\" with behavior that changes according to the current state of the interpreter.\nImmediate words.\nThe word codice_45 marks the most recent colon definition as an \"immediate word\", effectively replacing its compilation semantics with its interpretation semantics. Immediate words are normally executed during compilation, not compiled, but this can be overridden by the programmer in either state. codice_22 is an example of an immediate word. In Forth, the word codice_47 takes a name as a parameter and appends the compilation semantics of the named word to the current definition even if the word was marked immediate. Forth-83 defined separate words codice_48 and codice_49 to force the compilation of non-immediate and immediate words, respectively.\nUnnamed words and execution tokens.\nIn Forth, unnamed words can be defined with the word codice_50 which compiles the following words up to the next codice_22 (semi-colon) and leaves an \"execution token\" on the data stack. The execution token provides an opaque handle for the compiled semantics, similar to the function pointers of the C programming language.\nExecution tokens can be stored in variables. The word codice_52 takes an execution token from the data stack and performs the associated semantics. The word codice_53 (compile-comma) takes an execution token from the data stack and appends the associated semantics to the current definition.\nThe word codice_54 (tick) takes the name of a word as a parameter and returns the execution token associated with that word on the data stack. In interpretation state, codice_55 is equivalent to codice_56.\nParsing words and comments.\nThe words codice_21 (colon), codice_47, codice_54 (tick) are examples of \"parsing words\" that take their arguments from the user input device instead of the data stack. Another example is the word codice_60 (paren) which reads and ignores the following words up to and including the next right parenthesis and is used to place comments in a colon definition. Similarly, the word codice_61 (backslash) is used for comments that continue to the end of the current line. To be parsed correctly, codice_60 (paren) and codice_61 (backslash) must be separated by whitespace from the following comment text.\nStructure of code.\nIn most Forth systems, the body of a code definition consists of either machine language, or some form of threaded code. The original Forth which follows the informal FIG standard (Forth Interest Group), is a TIL (Threaded Interpretive Language). This is also called indirect-threaded code, but direct-threaded and subroutine threaded Forths have also become popular in modern times. The fastest modern Forths, such as SwiftForth, VFX Forth, and iForth, compile Forth to native machine code.\nData objects.\nWhen a word is a variable or other data object, the CF points to the runtime code associated with the defining word that created it. A defining word has a characteristic \"defining behavior\" (creating a dictionary entry plus possibly allocating and initializing data space) and also specifies the behavior of an instance of the class of words constructed by this defining word. Examples include:\nForth also provides a facility by which a programmer can define new application-specific defining words, specifying both a custom defining behavior and instance behavior. Some examples include circular buffers, named bits on an I/O port, and automatically indexed arrays.\nData objects defined by these and similar words are global in scope. The function provided by local variables in other languages is provided by the data stack in Forth (although Forth also has real local variables). Forth programming style uses very few named data objects compared with other languages; typically such data objects are used to contain data which is used by a number of words or tasks (in a multitasked implementation).\nForth does not enforce consistency of data type usage; it is the programmer's responsibility to use appropriate operators to fetch and store values or perform other operations on data.\nProgramming.\nWords written in Forth are compiled into an executable form. The classical \"indirect threaded\" implementations compile lists of addresses of words to be executed in turn; many modern systems generate actual machine code (including calls to some external words and code for others expanded in place). Some systems have optimizing compilers. Generally speaking, a Forth program is saved as the memory image of the compiled program with a single command (e.g., RUN) that is executed when the compiled version is loaded.\nDuring development, the programmer uses the interpreter in REPL mode to execute and test each little piece as it is developed. Most Forth programmers therefore advocate a loose top-down design, and bottom-up development with continuous testing and integration.\nThe top-down design is usually separation of the program into \"vocabularies\" that are then used as high-level sets of tools to write the final program. A well-designed Forth program reads like natural language, and implements not just a single solution, but also sets of tools to attack related problems.\nCode examples.\n\u201cHello, World!\u201d.\nOne possible implementation:\n : HELLO ( -- ) CR .\" Hello, World!\" ;\n HELLO &lt;cr&gt;\n Hello, World!\nThe word codice_4 (Carriage Return) causes the following output to be displayed on a new line. The parsing word codice_70 (dot-quote) reads a double-quote delimited string and appends code to the current definition so that the parsed string will be displayed on execution. The space character separating the word codice_70 from the string codice_72 is not included as part of the string. It is needed so that the parser recognizes codice_70 as a Forth word.\nA standard Forth system is also an interpreter, and the same output can be obtained by typing the following code fragment into the Forth console:\n CR .( Hello, World!)\ncodice_74 (dot-paren) is an immediate word that parses a parenthesis-delimited string and displays it. As with the word codice_70 the space character separating codice_74 from codice_72 is not part of the string.\nThe word codice_4 comes before the text to print. By convention, the Forth interpreter does not start output on a new line. Also by convention, the interpreter waits for input at the end of the previous line, after an codice_79 prompt. There is no implied \"flush-buffer\" action in Forth's codice_4, as sometimes is in other programming languages.\nMixing states of compiling and interpreting.\nHere is the definition of a word codice_81 which when executed emits the single character codice_82:\n : EMIT-Q 81 ( the ASCII value for the character 'Q' ) EMIT ;\nThis definition was written to use the ASCII value of the codice_82 character (81) directly. The text between the parentheses is a comment and is ignored by the compiler. The word codice_84 takes a value from the data stack and displays the corresponding character.\nThe following redefinition of codice_81 uses the words codice_40 (left-bracket), codice_41 (right-bracket), codice_88 and codice_42 to temporarily switch to interpreter state, calculate the ASCII value of the codice_82 character, return to compilation state and append the calculated value to the current colon definition:\n : EMIT-Q [ CHAR Q ] LITERAL EMIT ;\nThe parsing word codice_88 takes a space-delimited word as parameter and places the value of its first character on the data stack. The word codice_92 is an immediate version of codice_88. Using codice_92, the example definition for codice_81 could be rewritten like this:\n : EMIT-Q [CHAR] Q EMIT ; \\ Emit the single character 'Q'\nThis definition used codice_61 (backslash) for the describing comment.\nBoth codice_88 and codice_92 are predefined in Forth. Using codice_45 and codice_47, codice_92 could have been defined like this:\n : [CHAR] CHAR POSTPONE LITERAL ; IMMEDIATE\nA complete RC4 cipher program.\nIn 1987, Ron Rivest developed the RC4 cipher-system for RSA Data Security, Inc. The code is extremely simple and can be written by most programmers from the description:\nWe have an array of 256 bytes, all different. Every time the array is used it changes by swapping two bytes. The swaps are controlled by counters \"i\" and \"j\", each initially 0. To get a new \"i\", add 1. To get a new \"j\", add the array byte at the new \"i\". Exchange the array bytes at \"i\" and \"j\". The code is the array byte at the sum of the array bytes at \"i\" and \"j\". This is XORed with a byte of the plaintext to encrypt, or the ciphertext to decrypt. The array is initialized by first setting it to 0 through 255. Then step through it using \"i\" and \"j\", getting the new \"j\" by adding to it the array byte at \"i\" and a key byte, and swapping the array bytes at \"i\" and \"j\". Finally, \"i\" and \"j\" are set to 0. All additions are modulo 256.\nThe following Standard Forth version uses Core and Core Extension words only.\n0 value ii 0 value jj\n0 value KeyAddr 0 value KeyLen\ncreate SArray 256 allot \\ state array of 256 bytes\n jj SArray get_byte\n ii SArray get_byte jj SArray set_byte\n ii SArray set_byte\n 256 min TO KeyLen TO KeyAddr\n 256 0 DO i i SArray set_byte LOOP\n reset_ij\n BEGIN\n ii KeyArray get_byte jj + j_update\n swap_s_ij\n ii 255 &lt; WHILE\n ii i_update\n REPEAT\n reset_ij\n ii i_update jj j_update\n swap_s_ij\n ii SArray get_byte jj SArray get_byte + as_byte SArray get_byte xor\nThis is one of many ways to test the code:\nhex\ncreate AKey 61 c, 8A c, 63 c, D2 c, FB c,\nAKey 5 rc4_init\n2C F9 4C EE DC 5 test \\ output should be: F1 38 29 C9 DE\nImplementations.\nBecause the Forth virtual machine is simple to implement and has no standard reference implementation, there are numerous implementations of the language. In addition to supporting the standard varieties of desktop computer systems (POSIX, Microsoft Windows, macOS), many of these Forth systems also target a variety of embedded systems. Listed here are some of the more prominent systems which conform to the 1994 Forth standard."}

He was a man of broad knowledge, an expert in Newtonianism, architecture and opera. He was a friend of Frederick the Great and leading authors of his times: Voltaire, Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens, Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis and the atheist Julien Offray de La Mettrie. Lord Chesterfield, Thomas Gray, George Lyttelton, Thomas Hollis, Metastasio, Benedict XIV and Heinrich von Br\u00fchl were among his correspondents.\nEarly life.\nAlgarotti was born in Venice as the son of a rich merchant. His father and uncle were art collectors. Unlike his older brother Bonomo he did not step into the company, but decided to become an author. Francesco studied natural sciences and mathematics in Rome and Bologna under Francesco Maria Zanotti and in 1728 he experimented with optics. (Zanotti became a lifelong friend.) He was educated in his native Venice and in Rome and Bologna. His youthful curiosity led him to travel extensively, and he visited Paris for the first time in his early 20s. There his urbanity, his brilliant conversation, his good looks, and his versatile intelligence promptly made an impression on such intellectuals as Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis and Voltaire. Two years later he was in London, where he was made a fellow of the Royal Society. He became embroiled in a lively bisexual love-triangle with the politician John Hervey, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Algarotti left for Italy and finished his \"Neutonianismo per le dame\" (\"Newtonism for Ladies\") (1737 \u2013 dedicated to Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle) \u2013 a work consisting of information on astronomy, physics, mathematics, women and science and education.\nPersonal life and career.\nAlgarotti had made acquaintance with Antiochus Kantemir, a Moldavian diplomat, poet and composer. He was invited to visit Russia for the wedding of Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick. In 1739 he left with Lord Baltimore from Sheerness to Newcastle upon Tyne. Because of a heavy storm the ship sheltered in Harlingen. Algarotti was discovering \"this new city\", which he called the great window ... to which Russia looks on Europe. Returning from Saint Petersburg, they visited Frederick the Great in Rheinsberg. Algarotti had obligations in England and came back the year after. Then Algarotti went together with Frederick to K\u00f6nigsberg where he was crowned.\nFrederick, who was impressed with this walking encyclopedia, made him and his brother Bonomo Prussian counts in 1740. Algarotti accompanied Frederick to Bayreuth, Kehl, Strasbourg and Moyland Castle where they met with Voltaire, who was taking baths in Kleve for his health. In 1741 Algarotti went to Turin as his diplomat. Frederick had offered him a salary, but Algarotti refused. First, he went to Dresden and Venice, where he bought 21 paintings, a few by Jean-\u00c9tienne Liotard and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo for the court of Augustus III of Poland. Algarotti did not succeed in inducing the Kingdom of Sardinia to launch a treacherous attack upon Austria.\nAlgarotti and the other arts.\nAlgarotti's choice of works reflects the encyclopedic interests of the Neoclassic era; he was uninterested in developing a single unitary stylistic collection, and envisioned a modern museum, a catalog of styles from across the ages. For contemporary commissions, he wrote up a list of paintings he recommended commissioning, including history paintings from Tiepolo, Pittoni, and Piazzetta; scenes with animals from Castiglione, and veduta with ruins from Pannini. He wanted \"suggetti graziosi e leggeri\" from Balestra, Boucher, and Donato Creti. Other artists he supported were Giuseppe Nogari, Bernardo Bellotto, and Francesco Pavona.\nIn 1747 Algarotti went back to Potsdam and became court chamberlain, but left to visit the archeological diggings at Herculaneum. In 1749 he moved to Berlin. Algarotti was involved in finishing the architectural designs of Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff who had fallen ill. In February 1753, after several years residing in Prussia, he returned to Italy, living most of the time in Bologna. In 1759 Algarotti was involved in a new opera-style in the city of Parma. He influenced Guillaume du Tillot and the Duke of Parma.\nAlgarotti's \"Essay on the Opera\" (1755) was a major influence on the librettist Carlo Innocenzo Frugoni and the composer Tommaso Traetta, and in the development of Gluck's reformist ideology. Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of \"opera seria\", with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music, ballet or staging. The drama itself should \"delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense\". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist Calzabigi, writing their \"Orfeo ed Euridice\".\nIn 1762 Algarotti moved to Pisa, where he died of tuberculosis. Frederick the Great, who several times had needed Algarotti for writing texts in Latin, sent in a text for a monument to his memory on the Campo Santo."}

In 1515 he traveled to Ethiopia as part of the Portuguese embassy to emperor Lebna Dengel accompanied by returning Ethiopian ambassador Matheus. The embassy arrived only in 1520 to Ethiopia where he joined long sought Portuguese envoy P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3. There he remained six years, returning to Lisbon in 1526-27 having written a report entitled \"Verdadeira Informa\u00e7\u00e3o das Terras do Preste Jo\u00e3o das Indias\" (\"A True Relation of the Lands of Prester John of the Indies\").\n1515 embassy to Ethiopia.\nFrancisco \u00c1lvares was a chaplain-priest and almoner to King Manuel I of Portugal. He was sent in 1515 as part of the Portuguese embassy to the n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st (Emperor of Ethiopia), accompanied by the Ethiopian ambassador Matheus. Their first attempt to reach the port of Massawa failed due to the actions of Lopo Soares de Albergaria, governor of Portuguese India, which got no closer than the Dahlak Archipelago and was aborted with the death of the Portuguese ambassador, old Duarte Galv\u00e3o at Kamaran. \u00c1lvares and Mattheus were forced to wait until the arrival of Soares' replacement, Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, who successfully sent the embassy on, with Dom Rodrigo de Lima replacing Duarte Galv\u00e3o. The party at last reached Massawa on April 9, 1520, and reached the court of Lebna Dengel where he befriended several Europeans who had gained the favor of the Emperor, which included P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3 and Nicolao Branceleon. Father \u00c1lvares remained six years in Ethiopia, returning to Lisbon in either 1526 or 1527.\nIn 1533 he was allowed to accompany Dom Martinho de Portugal to Rome on an embassy to Pope Clement VII, to whom Father \u00c1lvares delivered the letter Lebna Dengel had written to the Pope. The precise date of Francisco \u00c1lvares death, like that of his birth, is unknown, but the writer of the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article concludes it was later than 1540, in which year an account of his travels were published at Lisbon. In the introduction of their translation of \u00c1lvares work, C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford furnish evidence that points to \u00c1lvares death in Rome, and admit that he may have died before his work was published.\n\u00c1lvares' writings.\nIn 1540, Lu\u00eds Rodrigues published a version of \u00c1lvares account in a one volume folio, entitled \"Verdadeira Informa\u00e7\u00e3o das Terras do Preste Jo\u00e3o das Indias\" (\"A True Relation of the Lands of Prester John of the Indies\"). C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford cite evidence, based in part on the earlier work of Professor Roberto Almagia, showing that Rodrigues's publication is only a part of \u00c1lvares's entire account. Another version of what \u00c1lvares wrote was included in an anthology of travel narratives, \"Navigationi et Viaggi\" assembled and published by Giovanni Battista Ramusio, and published in 1550. Almagia also identified three manuscripts in the Vatican Library which contain versions of excerpts from the original manuscript.\nFrancisco \u00c1lvares' work has been translated into English at least twice. The first time was the work of the Henry Stanley, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley for the Hakluyt Society in 1881. This translation was revised and augmented with notes by C. F. Beckingham and G. W. B. Huntingford, \"The Prester John of the Indies\" (Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1961).\nThe author of the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article was critical of the information it contained, believing it should \"be received with caution, as the author is prone to exaggerate, and does not confine himself to what came within his own observation.\" Beckingham and Huntingford, however, have a higher opinion of \u00c1lvares testimony, stating that not only is it \"incomparably more detailed than any earlier account of Ethiopia that has survived; it is also a very important source for Ethiopian history, for it was written just before the country was devastated by the Muslim Somali and pagan Galla invasions of the second quarter of the sixteenth century.\" He provides the first recorded and detailed descriptions of Axum and Lalibela.

They took their name from a prophecy in the Book of Daniel that four ancient monarchies (Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman) would precede the kingdom of Christ. They also referred to the year 1666 and its relationship to the biblical Number of the Beast indicating the end of earthly rule by carnal human beings. They were one of a number of nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around this time.\nRestoration.\nAfter the Restoration on 14 October 1660 Major-General Thomas Harrison was the first person to be found guilty of the regicide of Charles I. He had been the seventeenth of fifty-nine commissioners (judges) to sign the death warrant of the king in 1649. He was the first regicide to be hanged, drawn and quartered because he was considered by the new government to represent a continued real threat to the re-established order. This threat was realised when, on 6 January 1661, fifty Fifth Monarchists, headed by a wine-cooper named Thomas Venner, and thought to have been hiding out in Norton Folgate, made an effort to attain possession of London in the name of \"King Jesus\". Most of the fifty were either killed or taken prisoner, and on 19 and 21 January Venner and ten others were hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason.\nThe failure of Venner's Rising led to repressive legislation to suppress non-conformist sects. Although some physical events such as the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London continued to encourage belief in \"the end of the world\" ruled by carnal human beings, the doctrine of the sect either died out or became merged in a milder form of Millenarianism."}

He designed Continental paper money, the first United States coin, and two early versions of the American flag, one for the United States and one for the United States Navy. He was also one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, as a delegate from New Jersey. He served in various roles in the early United States government including as a member of the Second Continental Congress and as a member of the Navy Board. He later became the first federal judge of the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania on September 30, 1789.\nEducation and career.\nBorn on October 2, 1737 (Gregorian), September 21, 1737 (Julian) in Philadelphia, Province of Pennsylvania, British America, Hopkinson received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1757 from the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) and an Artium Magister degree in 1760 from the same institution. He was the first native American composer of a secular song in 1759. He was Secretary of a Commission of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania which made a treaty between the Province and certain Indian tribes in 1761. He entered private practice in Philadelphia, Province of Pennsylvania from 1761 to 1766. He was Collector of Customs in Salem, Province of New Jersey in 1763. Hopkinson spent from May 1766 to August 1767 in England in hopes of becoming Commissioner of Customs for North America. Although unsuccessful, he spent time with the future Prime Minister Lord North, Hopkinson's cousin James Johnson and the painter Benjamin West. He was a merchant in Philadelphia, Province of Pennsylvania, who sold varieties of fabric and port wine, starting in 1768. Additionally, in 1768 he was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society, and would go on to serve as the Society's Curator from 1776 to 1782. He was Collector of Customs for New Castle, Delaware Colony from 1772 to 1773. He resumed private practice in Bordentown from 1773 to 1774. He was a member of the New Jersey Provincial Council from 1774 to 1776. He was a member of the Executive Council of New Jersey from January 13, 1775, to November 15, 1775. He was admitted to practice before the bar of the Supreme Court of New Jersey on May 8, 1775. He was elected an Associate Justice of that court in 1776, but declined the office. He was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress (Continental Congress) from June 22, 1776, to November 30, 1776. He was a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. He was a member of the Navy Board in Philadelphia from 1776 to 1777. He was Treasurer for the Continental Loan Office in Philadelphia from 1778 to 1781. He was Judge of the Admiralty Court of Pennsylvania from 1779 to 1789. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Convention which ratified the United States Constitution.\nFederal judicial service.\nHopkinson was nominated by President George Washington on September 24, 1789, to the United States District Court for the District of Pennsylvania, to a new seat authorized by . He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 26, 1789, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on May 9, 1791, due to his death in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of a sudden apoplectic seizure. He was interred in Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia.\nPersonal life.\nHopkinson was the son of Thomas Hopkinson and Mary Johnson Hopkinson. He married Ann Borden on September 1, 1768. They would have five children. He was the father of Joseph Hopkinson, who was a member of the United States House of Representatives and also became a federal judge.\nCultural contributions.\nHopkinson wrote popular airs and political satires (\"jeux d'esprit\") in the form of poems and pamphlets. Some were widely circulated, and powerfully assisted in arousing and fostering the spirit of political independence that issued in the American Revolution. His principal writings are \"A Pretty Story . . .\" (1774), a satire about King George, \"The Prophecy\" (1776), and \"The Political Catechism\" (1777).\nOther notable essays are \"Typographical Method of conducting a Quarrel\", \"Essay on White Washing\", and \"Modern Learning\". Many of his writings can be found in \"Miscellaneous Essays and Occasional Writings\", published at Philadelphia in three volumes in 1792 (see Bibliography).\nHopkinson began to play the harpsichord at age seventeen and, during the 1750s, hand-copied arias, songs, and instrumental pieces by many European composers. He is credited as being the first American born composer to commit a composition to paper with his 1759 composition \"My Days Have Been So Wondrous Free.\" By the 1760s he was good enough on the harpsichord to play with professional musicians in concerts. Some of his more notable songs include \"The Treaty\", \"The Battle of the Kegs\", and \"The New Roof, a song for Federal Mechanics\". He also played organ at Philadelphia's Christ Church and composed or edited a number of hymns and psalms including: \"A Collection of Psalm Tunes with a few Anthems and Hymns Some of them Entirely New, for the Use of the United Churches of Christ Church and St. Peter's Church in Philadelphia\" (1763), \"A psalm of thanksgiving, Adapted to the Solemnity of Easter: To be performed on Sunday, the 30th of March, 1766, at Christ Church, Philadelphia\" (1766), and \"The Psalms of David, with the Ten Commandments, Creed, Lord's Prayer, &amp;c. in Metre\" (1767). In the 1780s, Hopkinson modified a glass harmonica to be played with a keyboard and invented the Bellarmonic, an instrument that utilized the tones of metal balls.\nAt his alma mater, University of Pennsylvania, one of the buildings in the Fisher-Hassenfeld College House is named after him.\nGreat Seal of the United States.\nOn March 25, 1780, Congress created a second committee to design the Great Seal of the United States. Before he worked as a consultant to a committee working on the design of the Great Seal. Hopkinson had designed the Great Seal of New Jersey with assistance from Pierre Eugene du Simitiere in 1776.\nFourteen men worked on the Great Seal of the United States, including two other consultants \u2013 Pierre Eugene du Simitiere (first Great Seal committee) and William Barton (third committee). The Seal was not finalized until June 20, 1782.\nOn today's Great Seal of the United States, the 13 stars (constellation) representing the 13 original states have five points. They are arranged in the shape of a larger star with six points. The constellation comprising 13 smaller stars symbolizes the national motto, \"E pluribus unum.\" Originally, the design had individual stars with six points, but this was changed in 1841 when a new die was cast. This seal is now impressed upon the reverse of the United States one-dollar bill. The reverse of the seal, designed by William Barton, contains an unfinished pyramid below a radiant eye. The unfinished pyramid was an image used by Hopkinson when he designed the Continental $50 currency bill.\nUnited States Flag.\nOn Saturday, June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Stars and Stripes as the first official national flag of the newly independent United States (later celebrated as Flag Day). The resolution creating the flag came from the Continental Marine Committee. Hopkinson became a member of the committee in 1776. At the time of the flag's adoption, he was the Chairman of the Navy Board, which was under the Marine Committee. Today, that office and responsibility/power would be residing in the United States Secretary of the Navy.\nHopkinson is recognized as the designer of the Flag of the United States, and the journals of the Continental Congress support this. On May 25, 1780, Hopkinson wrote a letter to the Continental Board of Admiralty mentioning several patriotic designs he had completed during the previous three years. One was his Board of Admiralty seal, which contained a shield of seven red and six white stripes on a blue field. Others included the Treasury Board seal, \"7 devices for the Continental Currency,\" and \"the Flag of the United States of America.\" Hopkinson noted that he hadn't asked for any compensation for the designs, but was now looking for a reward: \"a Quarter Cask of the public Wine.\" The board sent that letter on to Congress. While the request for the wine might seem comical in today's world, in the Revolutionary War period, the quarter cask of wine would not be subject to inflation.\nHopkinson submitted another bill on June 24 for his \"drawings and devices.\" In this second letter, Hopkinson did not mention designing the flag of the United States. Instead, the first item listed was \"the great Naval Flag of the United States\" along with the other contributions. This flag with its red outer stripes was designed to show up well on ships at sea. A parallel flag for the national flag was most likely intended by Hopkinson with white outer stripes as on the Great Seal of the United States and on the Bennington flag, which commemorated 50th anniversary of the founding of the United States (1826). Ironically, the Navy flag was preferred as the national flag. For the various designs, Hopkinson asked for cash in the amount of \u00a32,700. The Auditor General, James Milligan, commissioned an evaluation of the request for payment. The report from the commissioner of the Chamber of Accounts said that the bill was reasonable and ought to be paid. Congress used the usual bureaucratic tactics of asking for an itemized bill for payment in cash. Hopkinson requested \u00a39 for the naval flag. A committee investigated Hopkinson's charges that his payment was being delayed for arbitrary reasons. The Treasury Board turned down the request in an October 27, 1780, report to Congress. The Board cited several reasons for its action, including the fact that Hopkinson \"was not the only person consulted on those exhibitions of Fancy [that were incidental to the Board (among them, the U.S. flag, the Navy flag, the Admiralty seal, and the Great Seal with a reverse)], and therefore cannot claim the sole merit of them and not entitled in this respect to the full sum charged.\" The reference to the work of others is most probably a reference to his work on the Great Seal. For that work, he was not the only contributor, but served as a consultant to the second committee that worked on the Great Seal of the United States. Therefore, he would not be eligible to be paid for the Great Seal. Furthermore, the Great Seal project was still a work in progress. No known committee of the Continental Congress was ever documented with the assignment to design the national flag or naval flag. Hence, there was no evidence of collaboration with others on Hopkinson's flag design.\nThere is no known sketch of a Hopkinson flag\u2014either U.S. or naval\u2014in existence today. However, he incorporated elements of the two flags he designed in his rough sketches of the Great Seal of the United States and his design for the Admiralty Board Seal. The rough sketch of his second Great Seal proposal has 7 white stripes and 6 red stripes. The impression of Hopkinson's Admiralty Board Seal has a chevron with 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes. The Great Seal reflects Hopkinson's design for a governmental flag and the Admiralty Board Seal reflects Hopkinson's design for a naval flag. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. Both flags were intended to have 13 stripes. Because the original stars used in the Great Seal had six points, Hopkinson's U.S. flag might also have intended the use of 6-pointed stars. This is bolstered by his original sketch for the Great Seal that featured a U.S. flag with six-pointed asterisks for stars."}

He was the younger son of emperor Theodosius I and his first wife Aelia Flaccilla, and brother of Arcadius, who ruled the eastern half of the empire from 395, when their father died, until his death in 408. In 410, during Honorius's reign over the western Roman Empire, Rome was sacked for the first time in almost 800 years.\nEven by the standards of the rapidly declining Western Empire, Honorius's reign was precarious and chaotic. His early reign was supported by his principal general, Stilicho, who was successively Honorius's guardian (during his childhood) and his father-in-law (after the emperor became an adult).\nEmperor.\nEarly reign.\nAfter holding the consulate at the age of two, Honorius was declared \"Augustus\" by his father Theodosius I, and thus co-ruler, on 23 January 393 after the death of Valentinian II and the usurpation of Eugenius. When Theodosius died, in January 395, Honorius and Arcadius divided the Empire, so that Honorius became Western Roman Emperor at the age of ten.\nDuring the early part of his reign Honorius depended on the military leadership of the general Stilicho, who had been appointed by Theodosius and was of mixed Vandal and Roman ancestry. To strengthen his bonds with the young emperor, Stilicho married his daughter Maria to him. The epithalamion written for the occasion by Stilicho's court poet Claudian survives. Honorius was also influenced by the Popes of Rome. So it was that Pope Innocent I may have convinced Honorius to write to his brother, condemning the deposition of John Chrysostom in 407.\nAt first Honorius based his capital in Milan, but when the Visigoths under King Alaric I entered Italy in 401 he moved his capital to the coastal city of Ravenna, which was protected by a ring of marshes and strong fortifications. While the new capital was easier to defend, it was poorly situated to allow Roman forces to protect Central Italy from the increasingly regular threat of barbarian incursions. It was significant that the Emperor's residence remained in Ravenna until the overthrow of the last western Roman Emperor in 476. That was probably the reason why Ravenna was chosen not only as the capital of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy, but also for the seat of the Byzantine exarchs as well.\nStilicho and the defense of Italy.\nHonorius' reign was plagued by almost constant barbarian incursions into Gaul, Italy and Hispania. At the same time, a host of usurpers rose up due to the apparent inability of the Emperor to see to the Empire's defences.\nThe first crisis faced by Honorius was a revolt led by Gildo, the \"Comes Africae\" and \"Magister utriusque militiae per Africam\", in Northern Africa, which lasted for two years (397\u2013398). It was eventually subdued by Stilicho, under the local command of Mascezel, the very brother of Gildo.\nThe next crisis was the Visigothic invasion of Italy in 402 under the formidable command of their king, Alaric. Stilicho was absent in Raetia in the latter months of 401, when Alaric, who was also the Eastern Empire's magister militum in Illyricum, suddenly marched with a large army through the Julian Alps and entered Italy.\nStilicho hurried back to protect Honorius and the legions of Gaul and Britain were summoned to defend Italy. Honorius, slumbering at Milan, was caught unaware and quickly fled to Asti, only to be pursued by Alaric, who marched into Liguria. Stilicho defeated Alaric at Pollentia, on the river Tanarus on Easter Day (6 April 402). Alaric retreated to Verona, where Stilicho attacked him again. The Visigoths, weakened, were allowed to retreat back to Illyricum. In 405 Stilicho met an invasion of Italy led across the Danube by Radagaisus. They brought devastation to the heart of the Empire, until Stilicho defeated them in 406 and recruited most of them into his forces. Then, in 405/6, a tribal confedration, composed of Suevians, Vandals, Alans and Goths crossed the frozen Rhine and invaded Gaul.\nThe situation in Britain was even more difficult. The British provinces were isolated, lacking support from the Empire, and the soldiers supported the revolts of Marcus (406\u2013407), Gratian (407), and Constantine III. Constantine invaded Gaul in 407, occupying Arles, and while Constantine was in Gaul, his son Constans ruled over Britain. By 410, Britain was effectively told to look after its own affairs and expect no aid from Rome.\nThere was good reason for this as the western empire was effectively overstretched due to the massive invasion of Alans, Suebi and Vandals who, although they had been repulsed from Italy in 406, moved into Gaul on 31 December 406, and arrived in Hispania in 409. In early 408, Stilicho attempted to strengthen his position at court by marrying his second daughter, Thermantia, to Honorius after the death of the Empress Maria in 407 making Honorius the last Western Roman Emperor to have multiple wives. Another invasion by Alaric was prevented in 408 by Stilicho when he forced the Roman Senate to pay 4,000 pounds of gold to persuade the Goths to leave Italy.\nHonorius, in the meantime, was at Bononia, on his way from Ravenna to Ticinum, when the news reached him of his brother's death in May 408. He at first was planning to go to Constantinople to help set up the court during the transition from Arcadius to Theodosius II. Summoned from Ravenna for advice, Stilicho advised Honorius not to go, and proceeded to go himself. In Stilicho's absence, a minister named Olympius gained the confidence of Honorius. He convinced the emperor that his Arian father-in-law was conspiring with the barbarians to overthrow him.\nOn his return to Ravenna, Honorius ordered the arrest and execution of Stilicho. With Stilicho's fall, Honorius moved against all of his former father-in-law's allies, killing and torturing key individuals and ordering the confiscation of the property of anyone who had borne any office while Stilicho was in command. Honorius's wife Thermantia, daughter of Stilicho, was taken from the imperial throne and given over to her mother; Eucherius, the son of Stilicho, was put to death. The purge also massacred the families of Stilicho's foederati troops, and they defected en masse to Alaric.\nIn 409, Alaric returned to Italy to claim more gold and land to settle in, as feudatory vassals of the Empire, which Stilicho had promised him. Honorius refused to fulfill his former general's promises and Alaric marched on Rome, which bought him off after a short siege with Rome on the verge of famine.\nA palace revolution in Honorius' court led meanwhile to a change of ministers, and those hostile to the Goths were replaced by officers favorable to Alaric, who began peace negotiations. While the embassy was absent, a new change occurred at Ravenna, and Honorius disclaimed the peace which was on the verge of being concluded. The enraged Alaric returned to Rome and forced the Senate to elect Priscus Attalus as emperor, who ratified Alaric's former treaty with Stilicho.\nIn 410, the Eastern Roman Empire sent six legions (6,000 men; due to changes in tactics, legions of this period were about 1,000 soldiers, down from the 6,000-soldier legions of the Republic and early Empire periods) from Ravenna to aid Honorius, but Alaric ambushed the legions on the way, and only a handful of them reached Rome. To counter Attalus, Honorius tried to negotiate with Alaric in addition to restricting grain shipments to Rome from North Africa. Attalus dispatched an army to conquer Africa and restore the grain supply to Rome, but the governor, Heraclian, who was loyal to Honorius, wiped out this force as soon as it landed on the coast. As Rome was dependent on North African grain for sustenance, the populace was faced with the prospect of famine, and they blamed Attalus for the impending calamity. Growing desperate, Attalus searched for means of pacifying the people, but found himself, in consequence of conciliatory expenditures, incapable of satisfying his debt to Alaric, and thus alienated both Romans and Goths. In turn he came out to be exploited in political terms.\nConfronted with the increasing unpopularity and truculence of Attalus, Alaric dethroned him in 410 and proposed to renew negotiations with Honorius. Honorius, overconfident at Attalus' fall and the victory of his general Heraclian over Attalus' African expeditionary force, refused negotiation, and declared Alaric the eternal enemy of the Republic. The infuriated Alaric turned on the defenseless Rome and sacked the city.\nConstantius and the beginning of erosion of the Western Empire.\nThe revolt of Constantine III in the west continued through this period. In 409, Gerontius, Constantine III's general in Hispania, rebelled against him, proclaimed Maximus Emperor, and besieged Constantine at Arles. Honorius now found himself an able commander, Constantius, who defeated Maximus and Gerontius, and then Constantine, in 411.\nGaul was again a source of troubles for Honorius: just after Constantius's troops had returned to Italy, Jovinus revolted in northern Gaul, with the support of Alans, Burgundians, and the nobility of Gallic descent. Jovinus tried to negotiate with the invading Goths of Ataulf (412), but his proclamation of his brother Sebastianus as Augustus made Ataulf seek alliance with Honorius. Honorius had Ataulf defeat and execute Jovinus in 413. At the same time, Heraclianus raised the standard of revolt in North Africa, but failed during an invasion of Italy. Defeated, he fled back to Carthage and was killed.\nIn 414, Constantius attacked Ataulf, who proclaimed Priscus Attalus emperor again. Constantius drove Ataulf into Hispania, and Attalus, having again lost Visigoth support, was captured and deposed once again. In the eleventh consulship of Honorius and the second of Constantius, the Emperor entered Rome in triumph, with Attalus at the wheels of his chariot. Honorius punished Attalus by cutting off his right finger and thumb, inflicting the same fate with which Attalus had threatened Honorius. Remembering how Attalus had suggested that Honorius should retire to some small island, he returned the favor by banishing Attalus to the island of Lipara.\nNortheastern Gaul became subject to even greater Frankish influence, while a treaty signed in 418 granted to the Visigoths southwestern Gaul, the former Gallia Aquitania. Under the influence of Constantius, Honorius issued the Edict of 418, which was designed to enable the Empire to retain a hold on the lands which were to be surrendered to the Goths. This edict relaxed the administrative bonds that connected all the Seven Provinces (The Maritime Alps, Narbonensis Prima, Narbonensis Secunda, Novempopulania, Aquitania Prima, Aquitania Secunda and Viennensis) with the central government. It removed the imperial governors and allowed the inhabitants, as a dependent federation, to conduct their own affairs, for which purpose representatives of all the towns were to meet every year in Arles.\nIn 417, Constantius married Honorius's sister, Galla Placidia, much against her will. In 421, Honorius recognized him as co-emperor Constantius III; however, when the announcement of his elevation was sent to Constantinople, Theodosius refused to recognise him. Constantius, enraged, began preparations for a military conflict with the eastern empire but before he could commence it, he died early in 422.\nIn 420\u2013422, another Maximus (or perhaps the same) gained and lost power in Hispania. By the time of Honorius's death in 423, Britain, Spain and Gaul had been ravaged by barbarians. In his final years, Honorius reportedly developed a physical attraction to his half-sister, and in order to escape his unwelcome attentions, Galla Placidia and her children, the future emperor Valentinian III and his sister, Honoria, fled to Constantinople.\nDeath.\nHonorius died of edema on 15 August 423, leaving no heir. In the subsequent interregnum Joannes was nominated Emperor. The following year, however, the Eastern Emperor Theodosius II installed his cousin Valentinian III, son of Galla Placidia and Constantius III, as Emperor.\nThe Mausoleum of Honorius was located on the Vatican Hill, accessed from the transept of the Old Saint Peter's Basilica. It was first used for Maria. Probably Thermantia and Honorius's sister Galla Placidia, and perhaps other imperial family members, were later buried there. In the 8th century it was transformed into a church, the Chapel of St Petronilla, which held the relics of the saint and was demolished when the New St Peter's was erected.\nSack of Rome.\nThe most notable event of his reign was the assault and Sack of Rome on 24 August 410 by the Visigoths under Alaric.\nThe city had been under Visigothic siege since shortly after Stilicho's deposition and execution in the summer of 408. Lacking a strong general to control the by-now mostly Germanic Roman army, Honorius could do little to attack Alaric's forces directly, and apparently adopted the only strategy he could in the situation: wait passively for the Visigoths to grow weary and spend the time marshalling what forces he could. Unfortunately, this course of action appeared to be the product of Honorius' indecisive character and he suffered much criticism for it both from contemporaries and later historians.\nWhether this plan could have worked is perhaps debatable. In any case, it was overtaken by events. Stricken by starvation, somebody opened Rome's defenses to Alaric and the Goths poured in. The city had not been under the control of a foreign force since an invasion of Gauls some eight centuries before. The sack itself was notably mild as sacks go. For example, churches and religious statuary went unharmed. The psychological blow to the contemporary Roman world was considerably more painful. The shock of this event reverberated from Britain to Jerusalem, and inspired Augustine to write his magnum opus, \"The City of God\".\nThe year 410 also saw Honorius reply to a British plea for assistance against local barbarian incursions, called the \"Rescript of Honorius\". Preoccupied with the Visigoths, Honorius lacked any military capability to assist the distant province. According to the sixth century Byzantine scholar Zosimus, \"Honorius wrote letters to the cities in Britain, bidding them to guard themselves.\" This sentence is located randomly in the middle of a discussion of southern Italy; no further mention of Britain is made, which has led some modern academics to suggest that the rescript does not apply to Britain, but to Bruttium in Italy.\nAssessments.\nIn his \"History of the Wars\", Procopius mentions a story (which Edward Gibbon disbelieved) where, on hearing the news that Rome had \"perished\", Honorius was initially shocked; thinking the news was in reference to a favourite chicken he had named \"Roma\".\n\"At that time they say that the Emperor Honorius in Ravenna received the message from one of the eunuchs, evidently a keeper of the poultry, that Rome had perished. And he cried out and said, 'And yet it has just eaten from my hands!' For he had a very large cock, Rome by name; and the eunuch comprehending his words said that it was the city of Rome which had perished at the hands of Alaric, and the emperor with a sigh of relief answered quickly: 'But I thought that my fowl Rome had perished.' So great, they say, was the folly with which this emperor was possessed.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\u2014Procopius, \"The Vandalic War (III.2.25\u201326)\"With regard of Procopius' tale, recently, T. Kov\u00e1cs proved that the fowl and Rome were not two entities but one, the possibility of being a monarch ruling over the Eastern and the Western sides of the empire. Honorius\u2019 rooster, indeed, symbolized his father\u2019s (Theodosius the Great) rise to the throne, his rule over both the Eastern and the Western halves of the Roman Empire. \nSummarising Procopius' account of Honorius's reign, the historian J.B. Bury wrote: \"His name would be forgotten among the obscurest occupants of the Imperial throne were it not that his reign coincided with the fatal period in which it was decided that western Europe was to pass from the Roman to the Teuton.\" After listing the disasters of those 28 years, Bury concluded:\"[Honorius] himself did nothing of note against the enemies who infested his realm, but personally he was extraordinarily fortunate in occupying the throne till he died a natural death and witnessing the destruction of the multitude of tyrants who rose up against him.\"\nHonorius issued a decree during his reign, prohibiting men from wearing trousers in Rome. The last known gladiatoral games took place during the reign of Honorius, who banned the practice in 399 and again in 404, reportedly due to the martyrdom of a Christian monk named Telemachus while he was protesting a gladiator fight."}

In acoustics, a formant is usually defined as a broad peak, or local maximum, in the spectrum. For harmonic sounds, with this definition, the formant frequency is sometimes taken as that of the harmonic partial that is most augmented by a resonance. The difference between these two definitions resides in whether \"formants\" characterise the production mechanisms of a sound or the produced sound itself. In practice, the frequency of a spectral peak differs from the associated resonance frequency, except when, by luck, harmonics are aligned with the resonance frequency.\nA room can be said to have formants characteristic of that particular room, due to the way sound reflects from its walls and objects. Room formants of this nature reinforce themselves by emphasizing specific frequencies and absorbing others, as exploited, for example, by Alvin Lucier in his piece \"I Am Sitting in a Room\".\nHistory.\nFrom an acoustic point of view, phonetics had a serious problem with the idea that the effective length of vocal tract changed vowels. It was unclear how they could depend on frequencies when everyone from bass to soprano can make the same vowels. There had to be some way to normalize the frequencies. Hermann suggested a solution to this problem in 1894, coining the term \u201cformant\u201d. A vowel, according to him, is a special acoustic phenomenon, depending on the intermittent production of a special partial, or \u201cformant\u201d, or \u201ccharacteristique\u201d. The frequency of the \u201cformant\u201d may vary a little without altering the character of the vowel. For \"a\", for example, the \u201cformant\u201d may vary from 350 to 440\u00a0Hz even in the same person.\nPhonetics.\nFormants are distinctive frequency components of the acoustic signal produced by speech, musical instruments or singing. The information that humans require to distinguish between speech sounds can be represented purely quantitatively by specifying peaks in the amplitude or frequency spectrum.\nMost of these formants are produced by tube and chamber resonance, but a few whistle tones derive from periodic collapse of Venturi effect low-pressure zones. The formant with the lowest frequency is called \"F\"1, the second \"F\"2, and the third \"F\"3. Most often the two first formants, \"F\"1 and \"F\"2, are sufficient to identify the vowel. The relationship between the perceived vowel quality and the first two formant frequencies can be appreciated by listening to \"artificial vowels\" that are generated by passing a click train (to simulate the glottal pulse train) through a pair of bandpass filters (to simulate vocal tract resonances).\nNasal consonants usually have an additional formant around 2500\u00a0Hz. The liquid usually has an extra formant at 1500\u00a0Hz, whereas the English \"r\" sound () is distinguished by a very low third formant (well below 2000\u00a0Hz).\nPlosives (and, to some degree, fricatives) modify the placement of formants in the surrounding vowels. Bilabial sounds (such as and in \"ball\" or \"sap\") cause a lowering of the formants; velar sounds ( and in English) almost always show \"F\"2 and \"F\"3 coming together in a 'velar pinch' before the velar and separating from the same 'pinch' as the velar is released; alveolar sounds (English and ) cause fewer systematic changes in neighbouring vowel formants, depending partially on exactly which vowel is present. The time course of these changes in vowel formant frequencies are referred to as 'formant transitions'.\nIf the fundamental frequency of the underlying vibration is higher than a resonance frequency of the system, then the formant usually imparted by that resonance will be mostly lost. This is most apparent in the example of soprano opera singers, who sing high enough that their vowels become very hard to distinguish.\nControl of resonances is an essential component of the vocal technique known as overtone singing, in which the performer sings a low fundamental tone, and creates sharp resonances to select upper harmonics, giving the impression of several tones being sung at once.\nSpectrograms may be used to visualise formants. In spectrograms, it can be hard to distinguish formants from naturally occurring harmonics when one sings. However, one can hear the natural formants in a vowel shape through atonal techniques such as vocal fry.\nFormant estimation.\nFormants, whether they are seen as acoustic resonances of the vocal tract, or as local maxima in the speech spectrum, like band-pass filters, are defined by their frequency and by their spectral width.\nDifferent methods exist to obtain this information. Formant frequencies, in their acoustic definition, can be estimated from the frequency spectrum of the sound, using a spectrogram (in the figure) or a spectrum analyzer. However, to estimate the acoustic resonances of the vocal tract (i.e. the speech definition of formants) from a speech recording, one can use \"linear predictive coding\". An intermediate approach consists in extracting the spectral envelope by neutralizing the fundamental frequency, and only then looking for local maxima in the spectral envelope.\nFormant plots.\nThe first two formants are important in determining the quality of vowels, and are frequently said to correspond to the open/close and front/back dimensions (which have traditionally, though not entirely accurately, been associated with the shape and position of the tongue). Thus the first formant \"F\"1 has a higher frequency for an open vowel (such as ) and a lower frequency for a closed vowel (such as or ); and the second formant \"F\"2 has a higher frequency for a front vowel (such as ) and a lower frequency for a back vowel (such as ). as can be seen in Fig. 1. Vowels will almost always have four or more distinguishable formants; sometimes there are more than six. However, the first two formants are most important in determining vowel quality, and this is often displayed in terms of a plot of the first formant against the second formant, though this is not sufficient to capture some aspects of vowel quality, such as rounding. An example of how the vowels of a language or dialect may be plotted on a traditional auditory vowel chart and also on a formant plot may be seen in the case of Norwegian.\nMany writers have addressed the problem of finding an optimal alignment of the positions of vowels on formant plots with those on the conventional vowel quadrilateral. The pioneering work of Ladefoged used the Mel scale because this scale was claimed to correspond more closely to the auditory scale of pitch than to the acoustic measure of fundamental frequency expressed in Hertz as in Fig. 1. Two alternatives to the Mel scale are the Bark scale and the ERB-rate scale. A comparison of these three scales is shown by Hayward, p.\u00a0141, and formant plots based on the Hertz scale and on the Bark scale are compared on p.\u00a0153. Another strategy for improving formant plots that has been widely adopted is to plot on the horizontal axis not the value of F2 but the difference between F1 and F2 for a given vowel.\nSinger's formant.\nStudies of the frequency spectrum of trained classical singers, especially male singers, indicate a clear formant around 3000\u00a0Hz (between 2800 and 3400\u00a0Hz) that is absent in speech or in the spectra of untrained singers. It is thought to be associated with one or more of the higher resonances of the vocal tract. It is this increase in energy at 3000\u00a0Hz which allows singers to be heard and understood over an orchestra. This formant is actively developed through vocal training, for instance through so-called \"voce di strega\" or \"witch's voice\" exercises and is caused by a part of the vocal tract acting as a resonator. In classical music and vocal pedagogy, this phenomenon is also known as \"squillo\".\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Human voice]]\n[[Category:Sound synthesis types]]\n[[Category:Acoustics]]"}

{"id": "11028", "revid": "20611691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11028", "title": "Film stock", "text": "Film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation. It is recorded on by a movie camera, developed, \nedited, and projected onto a screen using a movie projector. It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum.\nIn black-and-white photographic film there is usually one layer of silver salts. When the exposed grains are developed, the silver salts are converted to metallic silver, which blocks light and appears as the black part of the film negative. Color film has at least three sensitive layers. Dyes, which adsorb to the surface of the silver salts, make the crystals sensitive to different colors. Typically the blue-sensitive layer is on top, followed by the green and red layers. During development, the exposed silver salts are converted to metallic silver, just as with black-and-white film. But in a color film, the by-products of the development reaction simultaneously combine with chemicals known as color couplers that are included either in the film itself or in the developer solution to form colored dyes. Because the by-products are created in direct proportion to the amount of exposure and development, the dye clouds formed are also in proportion to the exposure and development. Following development, the silver is converted back to silver salts in the \"bleach step\". It is removed from the film in the \"fix step\" and is sometimes recovered for subsequent use or sale. Fixing leaves behind only the formed color dyes, which combine to make up the colored visible image. Later color films, like Kodacolor II, have as many as 12 emulsion layers, with upwards of 20 different chemicals in each layer. Photographic film and film stock tend to be similar in composition and speed, but often not in other parameters such as frame size and length.\nHistory.\n1888\u20131899: Before standardization.\nEarly motion picture experiments in the 1880s were performed using a fragile paper roll film, with which it was difficult to view a single, continuously moving image without a complex apparatus. The first transparent and flexible film base material was celluloid, which was discovered and refined for photographic use by John Carbutt, Hannibal Goodwin, and George Eastman. Eastman Kodak made celluloid film commercially available in 1889; Thomas Henry Blair, in 1891, was his first competitor. The stock had a frosted base to facilitate easier viewing by transmitted light. Emulsions were orthochromatic. By November 1891 William Dickson, at Edison's laboratory, was using Blair's stock for Kinetoscope experiments. Blair's company supplied film to Edison for five years. Between 1892 and 1893, Eastman experienced problems with production. Because of patent lawsuits in 1893, Blair left his American company and established another in Britain. Eastman became Edison's supplier of film.\nBlair's new company supplied European filmmaking pioneers, including Birt Acres, Robert Paul, George Albert Smith, Charles Urban, and the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers. By 1896, the new movie projector required a fully transparent film base that Blair's American operation could not supply. Eastman shortly thereafter bought the company out and became the leading supplier of film stock. Louis Lumi\u00e8re worked with Victor Planchon to adapt the Lumi\u00e8re \"Blue Label\" (Etiquette Bleue) photographic plate emulsion for use on celluloid roll film, which began in early 1896.\nEastman's first motion picture film stock was offered in 1889. At first the film was the same as photographic film. By 1916, separate \"Cine Type\" films were offered. From 1895, Eastman supplied their motion picture roll film in rolls of 65 feet, while Blair's rolls were 75 feet. If longer lengths were needed, the unexposed negative rolls could be cemented in a darkroom, but this was largely undesirable by most narrative filmmakers. The makers of Actuality films were much more eager to undertake this method, however, in order to depict longer actions. They created cemented rolls as long as 1,000 feet. American Mutoscope and Biograph was the first known company to use such film for the Jeffries-Sharkey fight on November 3, 1899.\n1900\u20131919: Toward the standard picture film.\nAs the quantity of film and filmmakers grew, the demand for standardization increased. Between 1900 and 1910, film formats gradually became standardized and film stocks improved. A number of film gauges were made. Eastman increased the length of rolls to 200 feet without major adjustments to the emulsion, retaining a large market share. Lumi\u00e8re reformulated its stock to match the speed of Eastman film, naming it 'Etiquette Violette' (Violet Label). Blair sold his English company to Path\u00e9 in 1907 and retired to the US. Path\u00e9 began to supplement its operation in 1910 by purchasing film prints, stripping the emulsion from the film base and re-coating it. 35mm film began to become the dominant gauge because of the commonality of Edison's and Lumi\u00e8re's cameras. Consumers usually purchased unperforated film and had to punch it by perforators that were often imprecise, causing difficulty in making prints for the opposite perforation format. In 1908, the perforators began to be made by Bell and Howell. Eastman Kodak used the Bell and Howell's machine to perforate its films. In 1909, Edison's organization of the Motion Picture Patents Trust agreed to what would become the standard: 35\u00a0mm gauge, with Edison perforations and a 1.33 aspect ratio.\nAgfa began to produce motion picture film in 1913, but remained a largely local supplier until World War I boycotts of popular French, American and Italian film stocks allowed the UFA film studio to flourish, boosting Agfa's orders. All film stocks were manufactured on a nitrate film base, which is highly flammable. Nitrate film fires were virtually impossible to extinguish. A significant number of fatal accidents occurred in theatrical projection booths, where the heat of the projector lamp made ignition a possibility. Amateur filmmaking (home movies) slowly developed during this period. Kodak developed a heat-resistant 'safety base' for home projection.\nIn 1909, tests showed cellulose diacetate to be a viable replacement base, and Kodak began selling acetate-base films the following year in 22\u00a0mm widths for Edison's work on the Home Kinetoscope, which was commercially released in 1912. Eastman Kodak introduced a non-flammable 35\u00a0mm film stock in 1909. The plasticizers used to make the film flexible evaporated quickly, making the film dry and brittle, causing splices to part and perforations to tear. In 1911 the major American film studios returned to using nitrate stock. More amateur formats began to use acetate-based film, and several, including Kodak's own 16 mm format, were designed specifically to be manufactured with safety base. Kodak released Cine Negative Film Type E in 1916 and Type F (later known as Negative Film Par Speed Type 1201) in 1917. As both of these orthochromatic films were no faster than previous offerings, the improvements were in granularity and sharpness.\n1920s: Diversification of film sensitivity.\nFilm stock manufacturers began to diversify their products. Each manufacturer had previously offered one negative stock (usually orthochromatic) and one print stock. In 1920, a variant of Type F film known as X-back was introduced to counteract the effects of static electricity on the film, which can cause sparking and create odd exposure patterns on the film. A resin backing was used on the film, which rendered the film too opaque to allow focusing through the back of the film, a common technique for many cameras of that era. The X-back stock was popular on the east coast of the US. Other manufacturers were established in the 1920s, including American E.I. Dupont de Nemours in 1926 and Belgian Gevaert in 1925. Panchromatic film stock became more common. Created in 1913 for use in early color film processes such as Kinemacolor, panchromatic was first used in a black-and-white film for exterior sequences in \"Queen of the Sea\" (1918) and originally available as a special order product. The stock's increased sensitivity to red light made it an attractive option for day for night shooting. Kodak financed a feature in 1922, shot entirely with panchromatic stock, \"The Headless Horseman\", to promote the film when Kodak introduced it as a standard option. Panchromatic film stock increased costs and no motion pictures were produced on it in their entirety for several years. The cross-cutting between panchromatic and orthochromatic stocks caused continuity problems with costume tones and panchromatic film was often avoided.\nOrthochromatic film remained dominant until the mid-1920s due to Kodak's lack of competition in the panchromatic market. In 1925, Gevaert introduced an orthochromatic stock with limited color sensitivity and a fully panchromatic stock, Pan-23. In 1926, Kodak lowered the price of panchromatic stock to parity with its orthochromatic offering and the panchromatic stock began to overtake the orthochromatic stock's market share within a few years. As similar panchromatic film stocks were also manufactured by Agfa and Path\u00e9, making the shift to panchromatic stocks largely complete by 1928, Kodak discontinued orthochromatic stock in 1930.\nColour films.\nExperiments with colour films were made as early as the late 19th century, but practical colour film was not commercially viable until 1908, and for amateur use when Kodak introduced Kodachrome for 16\u00a0mm in 1935 and 8\u00a0mm in 1936. Commercially successful colour processes used special cameras loaded with black-and-white separation stocks rather than colour negative. Kinemacolor (1908\u20131914), Technicolor processes 1 through 4 (1917\u20131954), and Cinecolor used one, two or three strips of monochrome film stock sensitized to certain primary colours or exposed behind colour filters in special cameras. Technicolor introduced a colour reversal stock, called Monopack, for location shooting in 1941; it was ultimately a 35\u00a0mm version of Kodachrome that could be used in standard motion picture cameras.\nEastman Kodak introduced their first 35mm colour negative stock, Eastman Colour Negative film 5247, in 1950. A higher quality version in 1952, Eastman Colour Negative film 5248, was quickly adopted by Hollywood for colour motion picture production, replacing both the expensive three-strip Technicolor process and Monopack.\nClassification and properties.\nThere are several variables in classifying stocks; in practice, one orders raw stock by a code number, based on desired sensitivity to light.\nBase.\nA piece of film consists of a light-sensitive emulsion applied to a tough, transparent base, sometimes attached to anti-halation backing or \"rem-jet\" layer (now only on camera films). Originally the highly flammable cellulose nitrate was used. In the 1930s, film manufacturers introduced \"safety film\" with a cellulose triacetate plastic base. All amateur film stocks were safety film, but the use of nitrate persisted for professional releases. Kodak discontinued the manufacture of nitrate base in 1951, and the industry transitioned entirely to safety film in 1951 in the United States and by 1955 internationally. Since the late 1990s, almost all release prints have used polyester film stock.\nEmulsion.\nThe emulsion consists of silver halide grains suspended in a gelatin colloid; in the case of color film, there are three layers of silver halide, which are mixed with color couplers and interlayers that filter specific light spectra. These end up creating yellow, cyan, and magenta layers in the negative after development.\nChemistry.\nDevelopment chemicals applied to an appropriate film can produce either a positive (showing the same densities and colors as the subject) or negative image (with dark highlights, light shadows, and, in principle, complementary colors). The first films were darkened by light: negative films. Later films that produce a positive image became known as reversal films; processed transparent film of this type can be projected onto a screen. Negative images need to be transferred onto photographic paper or other substrate which reverses the image again, producing a final positive image. Creating a positive image from a negative film can also be done by scanning the negative to create a computer file which can then be reversed by software.\nImage record.\nDifferent emulsions and development processes exist for a variety of image recording possibilities: the two most common of which are black and white, and color. However, there are also variant types, such as infrared film (in black and white or false color); specialist technical films, such as those used for X-rays; and obsolete processes, such as orthochromatic film. Generally, however, the vast majority of stock used today is \"normal\" (visible spectrum) color, although \"normal\" black and white also commands a significant minority percentage.\nPhysical characteristics.\nFilm is also classified according to its gauge and the arrangement of its perforations\u2014 gauges range from 8 mm to 70 mm or more, while perforations may vary in shape, pitch, and positioning. The film is also distinguished by how it is wound with regard to perforations and base or emulsion side, as well as whether it is packaged around a core, a daylight spool, or within a cartridge. Depending on the manufacturing processes and camera equipment, lengths can vary anywhere from 25 to 2000 feet. Common lengths include 25 feet for 8\u00a0mm, 50 feet for Super 8, 100 and 400 feet for 16\u00a0mm, 400 and 1000 feet for 35\u00a0mm, and 1000 for 65/70\u00a0mm.\nResponsivity.\nA critical property of a stock is its film speed, determined by ASA or its sensitivity to light listed by a measurement on the raw stock which must be chosen with care. Speed determines the range of lighting conditions under which the film can be shot, and is related to granularity and contrast, which influence the look of the image. The stock manufacturer will usually give an exposure index (EI) number equal to the ASA which they recommend exposing for. However, factors such as forced or non-standard development (such as bleach bypass or cross processing), compensation for filters or shutter angle, as well as intended under- and over-exposure may cause the cinematographer to actually \"rate\" the stock differently from the EI. This new rating is not a change to the stock itself\u00a0\u2014 it is merely a way of calculating exposure without figuring out the compensation after each light reading.\nColour temperature.\nAnother important quality of colour film stock in particular is its colour balance, which is defined by the colour temperature at which it accurately records white. Tungsten lighting is defined at 3200 K, which is considered \"warmer\" in tone and shifted towards orange; daylight is defined at 5600 K, which is considered \"colder\" and shifted towards blue. This means that unfiltered tungsten stock will look normal shot under tungsten lights, but blue if shot during daylight. Conversely, daylight stock shot in daylight will look normal, but orange if shot under tungsten lights. Colour temperature issues such as these can be compensated for by other factors such as lens filters and colour gels placed in front of the lights. The colour temperature of a film stock is generally indicated next to the film speed number\u00a0\u2014 e.g. 500T stock is colour film stock with an ASA of 500 and balanced for tungsten light; 250D would have an ASA of 250 and be balanced for daylight. While black-and-white film has no colour temperature itself, the silver halide grains themselves tend to be slightly more responsive to blue light, and therefore will have daylight and tungsten speeds\u00a0\u2014 e.g. Kodak's Double-X stock is rated 250D/200T, since the tungsten light will give slightly less exposure than an equivalent amount of daylight.\nDeterioration.\nAll plastic is subject to deterioration through physical or chemical means, and thus, motion picture film is at risk for the same reason. Films deteriorate over time, which can damage individual frames or even lead to the entire film being destroyed. Cellulose nitrate, cellulose diacetate and triacetate are known to be unstable media: improperly preserved film can deteriorate in a period of time much faster than many photographs or other visual presentations. Cellulose nitrate, because of its unstable chemistry, eventually breaks down, releasing nitric acid, further catalyzing the decomposition. In the final stage of celluloid decomposition, the film has turned into a rust-like powder. Likewise, tri-acetate stock is also vulnerable to deterioration. Because of the small gauge of the film, owners of home-made films often find that their film can become shrunken and brittle to the point where the film is unwatchable in the space of a few years. In general, decaying acetate film breaks down into acetic acid, and similar to celluloid decomposition, leads to an auto-catylictic breakdown of the base that cannot be reversed. The result of the acetic acid released is a strong odor of vinegar, which is why the decay process in the archival community is known as \"vinegar syndrome\". Modern polyester-based stocks are far more stable by comparison and are rated to last hundreds of years if stored properly.\nIntermediate and print stocks.\nThe distinction between camera stocks and print stocks involves a difference in the recording process. When the work print or edit master has been approved, the Original Camera Negative (OCN) is assembled by a negative cutter using the edited work print or EDL (edit decision list) as a guide. A series of Answer Prints are then made from the OCN. During the Answer Print stage, corrections in the film's density and color are corrected (timed) to the filmmakers' tastes. Interpositive (IP) prints are struck from the OCN, checked to make sure they look the same as the custom timed Answer Print, and then each IP is used to make one or more Dupe Negative (DN) copies. The release prints are then generated from the DN(s). Recently, with the development of digital intermediate (DI), it has become possible to completely edit, composite visual effects, and color grade the image digitally at full resolution and bit-depth. In this workflow, the answer print is generated digitally and then written out to the IP stage using a laser film printer.\nDue to the specialized nature of the exposure and the higher degree of control afforded by the film lab equipment, these intermediate and release stocks are specially designed solely for these applications and are generally not feasible for camera shooting. Because intermediates only function to maintain the image information accurately across duplication, each manufacturer tends to only produce one or two different intermediate stocks. Similarly, release print stocks usually are available only in two varieties: a \"normal\" print or a deluxe print (on more-costly print film like Kodak Vision Premiere) with slightly greater saturation and contrast.\nDecline.\nUse of film remained the dominant form of cinematography until the early 21st century when digital formats supplanted the use of film in many applications. This has also led to the replacement of film projectors with digital projection.\nHowever, digital formats are sometimes deliberately altered to achieve a film look, such as adding film grain or other noise for artistic effect."}

The form calculates the total taxable income of the taxpayer and determines how much is to be paid or refunded by the government. \nIncome tax returns for individual calendar year taxpayers are due by Tax Day, which is usually April 15 of the next year, except when April 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. In those circumstances, the returns are due on the next business day. An automatic extension until October 15 to file Form 1040 can be obtained by filing Form 4868.\nForm 1040 consists of two pages (23 lines in total) not counting attachments. The first page collects information about the taxpayer(s) and dependents. In particular, the taxpayer specifies his/her filing status on this page. The second page reports income, calculates the allowable deductions and credits, figures the tax due given adjusted income, and applies funds already withheld from wages or estimated payments made towards the tax liability. On the right side of the first page is the presidential election campaign fund checkoff, which allows individuals to designate that the federal government give $3 of the tax it receives to the Presidential election campaign fund. Altogether, 142 million individual income tax returns were filed for the tax year 2018 (filing season 2019), 92% of which were filed electronically.\nFiling requirements.\nWho must file?\nForm 1040 (or a variant thereof) is the main tax form filed by individuals who are deemed residents of the United States for tax purposes. The corresponding main form filed by businesses is Form 1120, also called the U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return.\nAn individual is considered a resident of the United States for tax purposes if he or she is a citizen of the United States or a resident alien of the United States for tax purposes. An individual is a resident alien of the United States if he or she passes either the Substantial Presence Test or the Green Card Test, although there are also some other cases; individuals who have taxable income in the United States but fail the criteria for being resident aliens must file as nonresident aliens for tax purposes. While residents of the United States for tax purposes file Form 1040, nonresident aliens must file Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ. There is also a \"dual status alien\" for aliens whose status changed during the year.\nResident aliens of the United States for tax purposes must generally file if their income crosses a threshold where their taxable income is likely to be positive, but there are many other cases where it may be legally desirable to file. For instance, even if not required, individuals can file a return in order to receive a refund on withheld income or to receive certain credits (e.g. earned income tax credit).\nFiling modalities.\nThe form may be filed either by paper or online.\nPaper filing.\nPaper filing is the universally accepted filing method. Form 1040, along with its variants, schedules, and instructions, can be downloaded as PDFs from the Internal Revenue Service website. Finalized versions of the forms for the tax year (which in the US is the same as the calendar year) are released near the end of January of the following year.\nPaper forms can be filled and saved electronically using a compatible PDF reader, and then printed. This way, it is easy to keep electronic copies of one's filled forms despite filing by paper. Alternatively, they can be printed out and filled by hand. A combination of the approaches may also be used, with some content filled in electronically and additional content written in by hand. As a general rule, where possible, it makes sense to fill electronically, but in some cases filling by hand may be necessary (for instance, if additional notes of explanation need to be added, or the font used for electronic filling is too large to fit the information in the space provided.\nThe only parts of the form that cannot be filled electronically are the signature lines.\nThe paper Form 1040, along with all relevant schedules and additional forms, must be sent in a single packet by mail or courier to an IRS address determined by the US state the taxpayer is filing from and whether or not a payment is enclosed.\nThe IRS accepts returns that are stapled or paperclipped together. However, any check or payment voucher, as well as accompanying Form 1040-V, must \"not\" be stapled or paperclipped with the rest of the return, since payments are processed separately.\nElectronic filing.\nThe IRS allows US residents for tax purposes to file electronically in three ways:\nMany paid tax preparers are required to file individual tax returns electronically, and most tax compliance software file electronically on the taxpayer's behalf. Even the tax preparers who are not so required, must file Form 8948 if they choose paper filing, providing an explanation for why they are not filing electronically.\nComparison.\nIf one is not eligible for IRS Free File, it might cost hundreds of dollars to file electronically, whereas paper filing has no costs beyond those of printing and mailing. Furthermore, the available existing electronic filing options may not offer sufficient flexibility with respect to arranging one's tax return, adding attachments, or putting written notes of explanation that can help preempt IRS questions. Filing electronically also exposes the taxpayer's data to the risk of accidental loss or identity theft.\nSignature requirement.\nForm 1040 must be signed and dated in order to be considered valid. If filing jointly with a spouse, both must sign and date. If a return is submitted electronically, individuals must use either a Self-Select PIN or Practitioner PIN.\nSubstitute return.\nIf an individual decides not to file a return, the IRS may (after it has sent several reminders) file a substitute return.\nVariants.\nFor filing the regular tax return, in addition to the standard Form 1040, there are currently three variants: the 1040-NR 1040-SR, and 1040-X.\nForm 1040-NR is used by taxpayers who are considered \"non-resident aliens\" for tax purposes.\nForm 1040-SR is used by taxpayers who are 65 or older. Its creation was mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and it was first used for filing taxes for the 2019 tax year. Seniors may continue to use the standard 1040 for tax filing if they prefer.\nForm 1040-X (officially, the \"Amended U.S. Individual Tax Return\") is used to make corrections on Form 1040, Form 1040A, and Form 1040EZ tax returns that have been previously filed (note: forms 1040-A and 1040-EZ were discontinued starting with tax year 2018, but a 1040X may still be filed amending one of these tax forms filed for previous years).\nAccompanying payments.\nForm 1040-V.\nThe 1040-V (officially, the \"Payment Voucher for Form 1040\") is used as an optional payment voucher to be sent in along with a payment for any balance due on the \"Amount you owe\" line of the 1040.\nThe form is entirely optional. The IRS will accept payment without the 1040V form. However including the 1040-V allows the IRS to process payments more efficiently.\nForm 1040-V and any accompanying payment should be included in the same packet as the tax return, but should \"not\" be stapled or paper-clipped along with the tax return, since it is processed separately.\nSchedules and extra forms.\nSince 1961 Form 1040 has had various separate attachments to the form. These attachments are usually called \"schedules\" because prior to the 1961, the related sections were schedules on the main form identified by letter. Form 1040 currently has 20 attachments, which may need to be filed depending on the taxpayer. For 2009 and 2010 there was an additional form, , due to the \"Making Work Pay\" provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\"the stimulus\").\nStarting in 2018, 1040 was \"simplified\" by separating out 6 new schedules numbers Schedule 1 through Schedule 6 to make parts of the main form optional. The new schedules had the prior old 1040 line numbers to make transition easier.\nIn addition to the listed schedules, there are dozens of other forms that may be required when filing a personal income tax return. Typically these will provide additional details for deductions taken or income earned that are listed either on form 1040 or its subsequent schedules.\nIn 2014 there were two additions to Form 1040 due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2014the premium tax credit and the individual mandate.\nIn most situations, other Internal Revenue Service or Social Security Administration forms such as Form W-2 must be attached to the Form 1040, in addition to the Form 1040 schedules. There are over 100 other specialized forms that may need to be completed along with Schedules and the Form 1040. However, Form 1099 need not be attached if no tax was withheld. In general, employer-sent forms are used to substantiate claims of withholding, so only forms that involve withholding need to be attached.\nEstimated payments and withholding.\nFor most individuals, withholding is the main way through which taxes are paid. However, income that is not subject to withholding must be estimated using Form 1040-ES. (It may be possible to avoid filing Form 1040-ES by increasing one's withholding and instead filing a Form W-4.)\nEstimated payments can be made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System.\nPayments, refunds, and penalties.\nThere is a three-year limit to when individuals can claim a tax refund. However, payments that are due must be paid immediately.\nIn addition it is possible to apply one's refunds to next year's taxes and also to change one's mind later.\nAn automatic extension until October 15 to file Form 1040 can be obtained by filing Form 4868. There is a penalty for not filing a tax return by April 15 that depends on whether the individual got a filing extension and the amount of unpaid taxes. However, since the maximum penalty is 25% of unpaid taxes, if an individual has paid all their taxes, there is no penalty for not filing.\nIn addition to making sure that one pays one's taxes for the year by Tax Day, it is also important to make sure that one has paid partial taxes throughout the tax year in the form of estimated tax payments or employer tax withholding. If one has not done so, then a tax penalty may be assessed. The minimum amount of estimated taxes that need to be paid to avoid penalties depends on a variety of factors, including one's income in the tax year in question as well as one's income in the previous year (in general, if one pays 90% of the current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's tax liability during the tax year, one is not subject to estimated tax penalty even if this year's taxes are higher, but there are some caveats to that rule). Employer withholding is also treated differently from estimated tax payment, in that for the latter, the time of the year when the payment was made matters, whereas for the former, all that matters is how much has been withheld as of the end of the year (though there are other restrictions on how one can adjust one's withholding pattern that need to be enforced by the employer).\nWhen filing Form 1040, the penalty for failing to pay estimated taxes must be included on the form (on line 79) and included in the total on line 78 (if a net payment is due). The taxpayer is not required to compute other interest and penalties (such as penalty for late filing or late payment of taxes). If the taxpayer does choose to compute these, the computed penalty can be listed on the bottom margin of page 2 of the form, but should not be included on the amount due line (line 78).\nRelationship with state tax returns.\nEach state has separate tax codes in addition to federal taxes. Form 1040 is only used for federal taxes, and state taxes should be filed separately based on the individual state's form. Some states do not have any income tax. Although state taxes are filed separately, many state tax returns will reference items from Form 1040. For example, California's 540 Resident Income Tax form makes a reference to Form 1040's line 37 in line 13.\nCertain tax filing software, such as TurboTax, will simultaneously file state tax returns using information filled in on the 1040 form.\nThe Federal government allows individuals to deduct their state income tax or their state sales tax from their federal tax through Schedule A of Form 1040, but not both. In addition to deducting either income tax or sales tax, an individual can further deduct any state real estate taxes or private property taxes.\nOMB control number controversy.\nOne argument used by tax protesters against the legitimacy of the 1040 Form is the OMB Control Number of the Paperwork Reduction Act argument. Tax protesters contend that Form 1040 does not contain an \"OMB Control Number\" which is issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act.\nThe relevant clauses of the Paperwork Reduction Act state that:\nThe Courts have responded to the OMB Control Number arguments with the following arguments. 1) Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return has contained the OMB Control number since 1981. 2) As ruled in a number of cases, the absence of an OMB Control number does not eliminate the legal obligation to file or pay taxes.\nCases involving the OMB Control Number Argument include:\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit argues that the provisions on the Paperwork Reduction Act are not relevant as the act applies only to information requests made after December 31, 1981 and tax returns starting from 1981 contained an OMB Control Number.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the convicted taxpayer's OMB control number argument by stating \"Finally, we have no doubt that the IRS has complied with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Form 1040 bears a control number from OMB, as do the other forms the IRS commonly distributes to taxpayers. That this number has been constant since 1981 does not imply that OMB has shirked its duty.\" \nIn this Case, IRS agents who had calculated Mr. Lawrence's tax liability had made an error and it was discovered that Mr. Lawrence owed less taxes than originally determined. Lawrence asked the trial court to order the government to reimburse him for his legal fees, to which the trial court ruled against him. He appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, contending that the government's conduct against him had been \"vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith.\" and also raising the OMB Control Number Argument.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the OMB argument stating that\nAccording to Lawrence, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) required the Internal Revenue Service to display valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) numbers on its Form 1040\u2026. Lawrence argues that the PRA by its terms prohibits the government from imposing a criminal penalty upon a citizen for the failure to complete a form where the information request at issue does not comply with the PRA... Yet Lawrence conceded at oral argument that no case from this circuit establishes such a proposition, and in fact Lawrence cites no caselaw from any jurisdiction that so holds. In contrast, the government referenced numerous cases supporting its position that the PRA does not present a defense to a criminal action for failure to file income taxes.\" \nHistory.\nOriginal form structure and tax rates.\nThe first Form 1040 was published for use for the tax years 1913, 1914, and 1915;\nthe number 1040 was simply the next number in the sequential numbering of forms. For 1913, taxes applied only from March 1 to December 31. The original Form 1040, available on the IRS website as well as elsewhere, is three pages and 31 lines long, with the first page focused on computing one's income tax, the second page focused on more detailed documentation of one's income and the third page describing deductions and including a signature area. There is an additional page of instructions. The main rules were:\nJust over 350,000 forms were filed in 1914 and all were audited.\nSubsequent changes.\nFor 1916, Form 1040 was converted to an annual form (i.e., updated each year with the new tax year printed on the form). Initially, the IRS mailed tax booklets (Form 1040, instructions, and most common attachments) to all households. As alternative delivery methods (CPA/Attorneys, Internet forms) increased in popularity, the IRS sent fewer packets via mail. In 2009 this practice was discontinued.\nWith the Current Tax Payment Act of 1943, income tax withholding was introduced. The Individual Income Tax Act of 1944 created standard deductions on the 1040.\nThe tax return deadline was original set at March 1. This was changed to March 15 in the Revenue Act of 1918, and in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the tax return deadline was changed to April 15 from March 15, as part of a large-scale overhaul of the tax code. The reason for March 1 was not explained in the law, but was presumably to give time after the end of the tax (and calendar) year to prepare tax returns. The two-week extension from March 1 to March 15 occurred after the Revenue Act of 1918 was passed in February 1919, given only a few weeks to complete returns under the new law. The month extension from March 15 to April 15 was to give additional time for taxpayers and accountants to prepare taxes, owing to the more complex tax code, and also helped spread work by the IRS over a longer time, as it would receive returns over a longer time.\nThe 1040A was introduced by the 1930s to simplify the filing process and discontinued after tax year 2017. It was limited to taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000 who take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions.\nThe 1040EZ was used for tax years 1982-2017. Its use was limited to taxpayers with no dependents to claim, with taxable income below $100,000 who take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions.\nElectronic filing was introduced in a limited form in 1986, with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and starting 1992, taxpayers who owed money were allowed to file electronically. The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, jointly managed by the IRS and Financial Management Service, started in 1996 and allowed people to make estimated payments.\nWith the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a new, redesigned Form 1040 was released for tax year 2018. It reduced the number of lines from 79 to 23, removed two of the variants (1040A and 1040EZ) in favor of the redesigned Form 1040, and redesigned the supplemental schedules.\nChanges to complexity and tax rates.\nThe complexity and compliance burden of the form and its associated instructions have increased considerably since 1913. The National Taxpayers Union has documented the steady increase in complexity from a 34-line form in 1935 to a 79-line form in 2014, decreasing to 23 lines in 2018. \"Quartz\" created an animated GIF showing the gradual changes to the structure and complexity of the form. The NTU table is below with data through 2014:\nThe number of pages in the federal tax law grew from 400 in 1913 to over 72,000 in 2011. The increase in complexity can be attributed to an increase in the number and range of activities being taxed, an increase in the number of exemptions, credits, and deductions available, an increase in the subtlety of the rules governing taxation and the edge cases explicitly spelled out based on historical experience, and an increase in the base of taxpayers making it necessary to offer longer, more explicit instructions for less sophisticated taxpayers. As an example, whereas the initial versions of Form 1040 came only with a rate schedule included in the tax form itself, the IRS now publishes a complete tax table for taxable income up to $100,000 so that people can directly look up their tax liability from their taxable income without having to do complicated arithmetic calculations based on the rate schedule. The IRS still publishes its rate schedule so that people can quickly compute their approximate tax liability, and lets people with incomes of over $100,000 compute their taxes directly using the Tax Computation Worksheet.\nIn addition to an increase in the complexity of the form, the tax rates have also increased, though the increase in tax rates has not been steady (with huge upswings and downswings) in contrast with the steady increase in tax complexity.\nCost of filing.\nFor tax return preparation, Americans spent roughly 20% of the amount collected in taxes (estimating the compliance costs and efficiency costs is difficult because neither the government nor taxpayers maintain regular accounts of these costs). As of 2013, there were more tax preparers in the US (1.2 million) than there were law enforcement officers (765 thousand) and firefighters (310,400) combined. The National Taxpayers Union estimated the 2018 compliance cost at 11 hours per form 1040 vs. 12 hours in 2017, with a total of $92.5 billion spent in individual income tax compliance vs. $94.27 billion in 2017. \nIn 2008, 57.8% of tax returns were filed with assistance from paid tax preparers, compared to about 20% of taxpayers employing a paid preparer in the 1950s."}
{"id": "11033", "revid": "191757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11033", "title": "Frederick Douglass", "text": "Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey; \u00a0\u2013 February 20, 1895) was an American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman. After escaping from slavery in Maryland, he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, becoming famous for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings. Accordingly, he was described by abolitionists in his time as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens. Likewise, Northerners at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been a slave.\nDouglass wrote several autobiographies, notably describing his experiences as a slave in his \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave\" (1845), which became a bestseller, and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, \"My Bondage and My Freedom\" (1855). Following the Civil War, Douglass remained an active campaigner against slavery and wrote his last autobiography, \"Life and Times of Frederick Douglass\". First published in 1881 and revised in 1892, three years before his death, the book covers events both during and after the Civil War. Douglass also actively supported women's suffrage, and held several public offices. Without his approval, Douglass became the first African-American nominated for Vice President of the United States as the running mate and Vice Presidential nominee of Victoria Woodhull, on the Equal Rights Party ticket.\nDouglass was a firm believer in the equality of all peoples, be they white, black, female, Native American, or Chinese immigrants. He believed in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides, as well as in the liberal values of the U.S. Constitution. When radical abolitionists, under the motto \"No Union with Slaveholders,\" criticized Douglass' willingness to engage in dialogue with slave owners, he replied: \"I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong.\"\nLife as a slave.\nFrederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Talbot County, Maryland. The plantation was between Hillsboro and Cordova; his birthplace was likely his grandmother's cabin east of Tappers Corner, () and west of Tuckahoe Creek. In his first autobiography, Douglass stated: \"I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it.\" However, based on the extant records of Douglass's former owner, Aaron Anthony, historian Dickson J. Preston determined that Douglass was born in February 1818. Though the exact date of his birth is unknown, he later chose to celebrate February 14 as his birthday, remembering that his mother called him her \u201cLittle Valentine.\u201d\nBirth family.\nDouglass was of mixed race, which likely included Native American and African on his mother's side, as well as European. In contrast, his father was \"almost certainly white,\" according to historian David W. Blight in his 2018 biography of Douglass. Douglass claimed that his mother Harriet Bailey gave him his name Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey and, after escaping to the North years later, he took the surname Douglass, having already dropped his two middle names.\nHe later wrote of his earliest times with his mother:\nThe opinion was\u2026whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion I know nothing.\u2026 My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant.\u2026 It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age.\u2026 I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day. She was with me in the night. She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she was gone.\nAfter separation from his mother during infancy, young Frederick lived with his maternal grandmother Betsy Bailey, who was also a slave, and his maternal grandfather Isaac, who was free. Betsy would live until 1849. Frederick's mother remained on the plantation about away, only visiting Frederick a few times before her death when he was 7 years old.\nEarly learning and experience.\nThe Auld family.\nAt the age of 6, Frederick was separated from his grandparents and moved to the Wye House plantation, where Aaron Anthony worked as overseer. After Anthony died in 1826, Douglass was given to Lucretia Auld, wife of Thomas Auld, who sent him to serve Thomas' brother Hugh Auld in Baltimore. Lucretia was essential in Douglass' formation, as she shaped his experiences and took special interest in him from his childhood, wanting to give him a better life. Douglass felt that he was lucky to be in the city, where he said slaves were almost freemen, compared to those on plantations.\nWhen Douglass was about 12, Hugh Auld's wife Sophia began teaching him the alphabet. From the day he arrived, she saw to it that Douglass was properly fed and clothed, and that he slept in a bed with sheets and a blanket. Douglass described her as a kind and tender-hearted woman, who treated him \"as she supposed one human being ought to treat another.\" Hugh Auld disapproved of the tutoring, feeling that literacy would encourage slaves to desire freedom; Douglass later referred to this as the \"first decidedly antislavery lecture\" he had ever heard. Under her husband's influence, Sophia came to believe that education and slavery were incompatible and one day snatched a newspaper away from Douglass. She stopped teaching him altogether and hid all potential reading materials, including her Bible, from him. In his autobiography, Douglass related how he learned to read from white children in the neighborhood, and by observing the writings of the men he worked with.\nDouglass continued, secretly, to teach himself how to read and write. He later often said, \"knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom.\" As Douglass began to read newspapers, pamphlets, political materials, and books of every description, this new realm of thought led him to question and condemn the institution of slavery. In later years, Douglass credited \"The Columbian Orator\", an anthology that he discovered at about age 12, with clarifying and defining his views on freedom and human rights. First published in 1797, the book is a classroom reader, containing essays, speeches, and dialogues, to assist students in learning reading and grammar. He later learned that his mother had also been literate, about which he would later declare:\nI am quite willing, and even happy, to attribute any love of letters I possess, and for which I have got\u2014despite of prejudices\u2014only too much credit, not to my admitted Anglo-Saxon paternity, but to the native genius of my sable, unprotected, and uncultivated mother\u2014a woman, who belonged to a race whose mental endowments it is, at present, fashionable to hold in disparagement and contempt.\nWilliam Freeland.\nWhen Douglass was hired out to William Freeland, he taught other slaves on the plantation to read the New Testament at a weekly Sunday school. As word spread, the interest among slaves in learning to read was so great that in any week, more than 40 slaves would attend lessons. For about six months, their study went relatively unnoticed. While Freeland remained complacent about their activities, other plantation owners became incensed about their slaves being educated. One Sunday they burst in on the gathering, armed with clubs and stones, to disperse the congregation permanently.\nEdward Covey.\nIn 1833, Thomas Auld took Douglass back from Hugh (\"[a]s a means of punishing Hugh,\" Douglass later wrote). Thomas sent Douglass to work for Edward Covey, a poor farmer who had a reputation as a \"slave-breaker.\" He whipped Douglass so regularly that his wounds had little time to heal. Douglass later said the frequent whippings broke his body, soul, and spirit. The 16-year-old Douglass finally rebelled against the beatings, however, and fought back. After Douglass won a physical confrontation, Covey never tried to beat him again. Recounting his beatings at Covey's farm in \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave\", Douglass described himself as \"a man transformed into a brute!\" Still, Douglass came to see his physical fight with Covey as life-transforming, and introduced the story in his autobiography as such: \"You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man.\"\nFrom slavery to freedom.\nDouglass first tried to escape from Freeland, who had hired him from his owner, but was unsuccessful. In 1837, Douglass met and fell in love with Anna Murray, a free black woman in Baltimore about five years his senior. Her free status strengthened his belief in the possibility of gaining his own freedom. Murray encouraged him and supported his efforts by aid and money.\nOn September 3, 1838, Douglass successfully escaped by boarding a northbound train of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. The area where he boarded was a short distance east of the train depot, in a recently developed neighborhood between the modern neighborhoods of Harbor East and Little Italy. The depot was located at President and Fleet streets, east of \"The Basin\" of the Baltimore harbor, on the northwest branch of the Patapsco River.\nYoung Douglass reached Havre de Grace, Maryland, in Harford County, in the northeast corner of the state, along the southwest shore of the Susquehanna River, which flowed into the Chesapeake Bay. Although this placed him only some from the Maryland-Pennsylvania state line, it was easier to continue by rail through Delaware, another slave state. Dressed in a sailor's uniform provided to him by Murray, who also gave him part of her savings to cover his travel costs, he carried identification papers and protection papers that he had obtained from a free black seaman. Douglass crossed the wide Susquehanna River by the railroad's steam-ferry at Havre de Grace to Perryville on the opposite shore, in Cecil County, then continued by train across the state line to Wilmington, Delaware, a large port at the head of the Delaware Bay. From there, because the rail line was not yet completed, he went by steamboat along the Delaware River further northeast to the \"Quaker City\" of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, an anti-slavery stronghold. He continued to the safe house of noted abolitionist David Ruggles in New York City. His entire journey to freedom took less than 24 hours.\nFrederick Douglass later wrote of his arrival in New York City:\nOnce Douglass had arrived, he sent for Murray to follow him north to New York. She brought the necessary basics for them to set up a home. They were married on September 15, 1838, by a black Presbyterian minister, just eleven days after Douglass had reached New York. At first they adopted Johnson as their married name, to divert attention.\nAbolitionist and preacher.\nThe couple settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts (an abolitionist center, full of former slaves), in 1838, moving to Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1841. After meeting and staying with Nathan and Mary Johnson, they adopted Douglass as their married name: Douglass had grown up using his mother's surname of Bailey; after escaping slavery he had changed his surname first to Stanley and then to Johnson. In New Bedford, the latter was such a common name that he wanted one that was more distinctive, and asked Nathan Johnson to choose a suitable surname. Nathan suggested \"Douglass,\" after having read the poem \"The Lady of the Lake\" by Walter Scott, in which two of the principal characters have the surname \"Douglas.\"\nDouglass thought of joining a white Methodist Church, but was disappointed, from the beginning, upon finding that it was segregated. Later, he joined the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, an independent black denomination first established in New York City, which counted among its members Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman. He became a licensed preacher in 1839, which helped him to hone his oratorical skills. He held various positions, including steward, Sunday-school superintendent, and sexton. In 1840, Douglass delivered a speech in Elmira, New York, then a station on the Underground Railroad, in which a black congregation would form years later, becoming the region's largest church by 1940.\nDouglass also joined several organizations in New Bedford, and regularly attended abolitionist meetings. He subscribed to Wm. Lloyd Garrison's weekly newspaper, \"The Liberator\". He later said that \"no face and form ever impressed me with such sentiments [of the hatred of slavery] as did those of William Lloyd Garrison.\" So deep was this influence that in his last biography, Douglass confessed \"his paper took a place in my heart second only to The Bible.\" Garrison was likewise impressed with Douglass, and had written about his anti-colonialist stance in \"The Liberator\" as early as 1839. Douglass first heard Garrison speak in 1841, at a lecture that Garrison gave in Liberty Hall, New Bedford. At another meeting, Douglass was unexpectedly invited to speak. After telling his story, Douglass was encouraged to become an anti-slavery lecturer. A few days later Douglass spoke at the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society's annual convention, in Nantucket. Then 23 years old, Douglass conquered his nervousness and gave an eloquent speech about his rough life as a slave.\nWhile living in Lynn, Douglass engaged in early protest against segregated transportation. In September 1841, at Lynn Central Square station, Douglass and friend James N. Buffum were thrown off an Eastern Railroad train because Douglass refused to sit in the segregated railroad coach.\nIn 1843, Douglass joined other speakers in the American Anti-Slavery Society's \"Hundred Conventions\" project, a six-month tour at meeting halls throughout the eastern and midwestern United States. During this tour, slavery supporters frequently accosted Douglass. At a lecture in Pendleton, Indiana, an angry mob chased and beat Douglass before a local Quaker family, the Hardys, rescued him. His hand was broken in the attack; it healed improperly and bothered him for the rest of his life. A stone marker in Falls Park in the Pendleton Historic District commemorates this event.\nIn 1847, Frederick Douglass explained to Garrison, \"I have no love for America, as such; I have no patriotism. I have no country. What country have I? The Institutions of this Country do not know me\u2014do not recognize me as a man.\"\nAutobiography.\nDouglass' best-known work is his first autobiography, \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave\", written during his time in Lynn, Massachusetts and published in 1845. At the time, some skeptics questioned whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature. The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller. Within three years, it had been reprinted nine times, with 11,000 copies circulating in the United States. It was also translated into French and Dutch and published in Europe.\nDouglass published three versions of his autobiography during his lifetime (and revised the third of these), each time expanding on the previous one. The 1845 \"Narrative\" was his biggest seller, and probably allowed him to raise the funds to gain his legal freedom the following year, as discussed below. In 1855, Douglass published \"My Bondage and My Freedom\". In 1881, after the Civil War, Douglass published \"Life and Times of Frederick Douglass\", which he revised in 1892.\nTravels to Ireland and Great Britain.\nDouglass' friends and mentors feared that the publicity would draw the attention of his ex-owner, Hugh Auld, who might try to get his \"property\" back. They encouraged Douglass to tour Ireland, as many former slaves had done. Douglass set sail on the \"Cambria\" for Liverpool, England on August 16, 1845. He traveled in Ireland as the Great Famine was beginning.\nThe feeling of freedom from American racial discrimination amazed Douglass:\nEleven days and a half gone and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am under a monarchical government. Instead of the bright, blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the Emerald Isle [Ireland]. I breathe, and lo! the chattel [slave] becomes a man. I gaze around in vain for one who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or offer me an insult. I employ a cab\u2014I am seated beside white people\u2014I reach the hotel\u2014I enter the same door\u2014I am shown into the same parlour\u2014I dine at the same table\u2014and no one is offended ... I find myself regarded and treated at every turn with the kindness and deference paid to white people. When I go to church, I am met by no upturned nose and scornful lip to tell me, \"We don't allow niggers in here!\"\nHe also met and befriended the Irish nationalist Daniel O'Connell, who was to be a great inspiration.\nDouglass spent two years in Ireland and Great Britain, lecturing in churches and chapels. His draw was such that some facilities were \"crowded to suffocation\". One example was his hugely popular \"London Reception Speech\", which Douglass delivered in May 1846 at Alexander Fletcher's Finsbury Chapel. Douglass remarked that in England he was treated not \"as a color, but as a man.\"\nIn 1846, Douglass met with Thomas Clarkson, one of the last living British abolitionists, who had persuaded Parliament to abolish slavery in Great Britain's colonies. During this trip Douglass became legally free, as British supporters led by Anna Richardson and her sister-in-law Ellen of Newcastle upon Tyne raised funds to buy his freedom from his American owner Thomas Auld. Many supporters tried to encourage Douglass to remain in England but, with his wife still in Massachusetts and three million of his black brethren in bondage in the United States, he returned to America in the spring of 1847, soon after the death of Daniel O'Connell.\nIn the 21st century, historical plaques were installed on buildings in Cork and Waterford, Ireland, and London to celebrate Douglass' visit: the first is on the Imperial Hotel in Cork and was unveiled on August 31, 2012; the second is on the fa\u00e7ade of Waterford City Hall, unveiled on October 7, 2013. It commemorates his speech there on October 9, 1845. The third plaque adorns Nell Gwynn House, South Kensington in London, at the site of an earlier house where Douglass stayed with the British abolitionist George Thompson. A plaque on Gilmore Place in Edinburgh marks his stay there in 1846.\nReturn to the United States.\nAfter returning to the U.S. in 1847, using \u00a3500 () given him by English supporters, Douglass started publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, the \"North Star\", from the basement of the Memorial AME Zion Church in Rochester, New York. Originally, Pittsburgh journalist Martin Delany was co-editor but Douglass didn't feel he brought in enough subscriptions, and they parted ways. The \"North Star\"'s motto was \"Right is of no Sex \u2013 Truth is of no Color \u2013 God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren.\" The AME Church and \"North Star\" vigorously opposed the mostly white American Colonization Society and its proposal to send blacks back to Africa. Douglass also soon split with Garrison, perhaps because the \"North Star\" competed with Garrison's \"National Anti-Slavery Standard\" and Marius Robinson's \"Anti-Slavery Bugle\". Besides publishing the \"North Star\" and delivering speeches, Douglass also participated in the Underground Railroad. He and his wife provided lodging and resources in their home to more than four hundred escaped slaves.\nDouglass also came to disagree with Garrison. Earlier Douglass had agreed with Garrison's position that the Constitution was pro-slavery, because of the three-fifths clause its compromises related to apportionment of Congressional seats, based on partial counting of slave populations with state totals; and protection of the international slave trade through 1807. Garrison had burned copies of the Constitution to express his opinion. However, Lysander Spooner published \"The Unconstitutionality of Slavery\" (1846), which examined the United States Constitution as an anti-slavery document. Douglass' change of opinion about the Constitution and his splitting from Garrison around 1847 became one of the abolitionist movement's most notable divisions. Douglass angered Garrison by saying that the Constitution could and should be used as an instrument in the fight against slavery.\nIn September 1848, on the tenth anniversary of his escape, Douglass published an open letter addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and inquiring after members of his family still held by Auld. In the course of the letter, Douglass adeptly transitions from formal and restrained to familiar and then to impassioned. At one point he is the proud parent, describing his improved circumstances and the progress of his own four young children. But then he dramatically shifts tone: Oh! sir, a slaveholder never appears to me so completely an agent of hell, as when I think of and look upon my dear children. It is then that my feelings rise above my control. \u2026The grim horrors of slavery rise in all their ghastly terror before me, the wails of millions pierce my heart, and chill my blood. I remember the chain, the gag, the bloody whip, the deathlike gloom overshadowing the broken spirit of the fettered bondman, the appalling liability of his being torn away from wife and children, and sold like a beast in the market.\nIn a graphic passage, Douglass asked Auld how he would feel if Douglass had come to take away his daughter Amanda as a slave, treating her the way he and members of his family had been treated by Auld. Yet in his conclusion Douglass shows his focus and benevolence, stating that he has \u201cno malice towards him personally,\u201d and asserts that, \u201cthere is no roof under which you would be more safe than mine, and there is nothing in my house which you might need for comfort, which I would not readily grant. Indeed, I should esteem it a privilege, to set you an example as to how mankind ought to treat each other.\u201d\nWomen's rights.\nIn 1848, Douglass was the only African American to attend the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, in upstate New York. Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked the assembly to pass a resolution asking for women's suffrage. Many of those present opposed the idea, including influential Quakers James and Lucretia Mott. Douglass stood and spoke eloquently in favor of women's suffrage; he said that he could not accept the right to vote as a black man if women could not also claim that right. He suggested that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere.\nAfter Douglass' powerful words, the attendees passed the resolution.\nIn the wake of the Seneca Falls Convention, Douglass used an editorial in \"The North Star\" to press the case for women's rights. He recalled the \"marked ability and dignity\" of the proceedings, and briefly conveyed several arguments of the convention and feminist thought at the time.\nOn the first count, Douglass acknowledged the \"decorum\" of the participants in the face of disagreement. In the remainder he discussed the primary document that emerged from the conference, a Declaration of Sentiments, and the \"infant\" feminist cause. Strikingly, he expressed the belief that \"[a] discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far more complacency...than would be a discussion of the rights of women,\" and Douglass noted the link between abolitionism and feminism, the overlap between the communities.\nHis opinion as the editor of a prominent newspaper carried weight, and he stated the position of the \"North Star\" explicitly: \"We hold woman to be justly entitled to all we claim for man.\" This letter, written a week after the convention, reaffirmed the first part of the paper's slogan, \"right is of no sex.\"\nAfter the Civil War, when the 15th Amendment giving Blacks the right to vote was being debated, Douglass split with the Stanton-led faction of the women's rights movement. Douglass supported the amendment, which would grant suffrage to black men. Stanton opposed the 15th Amendment because it limited expansion of suffrage to black men; she predicted its passage would delay for decades the cause for women's right to vote. Stanton argued that American women and black men should band together to fight for universal suffrage, and opposed any bill that split the issues. Douglass and Stanton both knew that there was not yet enough male support for women's right to vote, but that an amendment giving black men the vote could pass in the late 1860s. Stanton wanted to attach women's suffrage to that of black men so that her cause would be carried to success.\nDouglass thought such a strategy was too risky, that there was barely enough support for black men's suffrage. He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. African-American women, he believed, would have the same degree of empowerment as white women once African-American men had the vote. Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women's right to vote.\nIdeological refinement.\nMeanwhile, in 1851, Douglass merged the \"North Star\" with Gerrit Smith's \"Liberty Party Paper\" to form \"Frederick Douglass' Paper\", which was published until 1860.\nOn July 5, 1852, Douglass delivered an address to the ladies of the Rochester Anti-Slavery Sewing Society. This speech eventually became known as \"What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?\"; one biographer called it \"perhaps the greatest antislavery oration ever given.\" In 1853, he was a prominent attendee of the radical abolitionist National African American Convention in Rochester. Douglass' was one of five names attached to the address of the convention to the people of the United States published under the title, \"The Claims of Our Common Cause\", along with Amos No\u00eb Freeman, James Monroe Whitfield, Henry O. Wagoner, and George Boyer Vashon.\nLike many abolitionists, Douglass believed that education would be crucial for African Americans to improve their lives; he was an early advocate for school desegregation. In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African-American children were vastly inferior to those for whites. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more pressing need for African Americans than political issues such as suffrage.\nJohn Brown.\nOn March 12, 1859, Douglass met with radical abolitionists John Brown, George DeBaptiste, and others at William Webb's house in Detroit to discuss emancipation. Douglass met Brown again when Brown visited his home two months before leading the raid on Harpers Ferry. Brown penned his Provisional Constitution during his two-week stay with Douglass. Also staying with Douglass for over a year was Shields Green, a fugitive slave that Douglass was helping, as he often did.\nThe secret meeting in the Chamsbersburg stone quarry.\nShortly before the raid, Douglass, taking Green with him, travelled from Rochester, via New York City, to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, John Brown's communications headquarters. There, in an abandoned stone quarry for secrecy, Douglass and Green met with Brown and John Henri Kagi, to discuss the raid. After discussions lasting over a day, Douglass, disappointing Brown, declined to join him, considering the mission suicidal. To Douglass's surprise, Green went with Brown instead of returning to Rochester with Douglass. \nAlmost all we know about this incident comes from Douglass. It is clear that it was of immense importance to him, both as a turning point in his life\u2014not accompanying John Brown\u2014and its importance in his public image. The meeting was not revealed by Douglas for 20 years. He first disclosed it in his speech on John Brown at Storer College in 1881, trying unsuccessfully to raise money to support a John Brown professorship at Storer, to be held by a Black man. He again referred to it stunningly in his last \"Autobiography.\"\nAfter the raid, which took place between October 16\u201318, 1859, Douglass was accused both of supporting Brown and of not supporting him enough. He was nearly arrested on a Virginia warrant, and fled for a brief time to Canada before proceeding onward to England on a previously-planned lecture tour, arriving near the end of November. Years later, in 1881, Douglass shared a stage in Harpers Ferry with Andrew Hunter, the prosecutor who secured Brown's conviction and execution. Hunter congratulated Douglass.\nDuring his lecture tour of Great Britain, on March 26, 1860, Douglass delivered a speech before the Scottish Anti-Slavery Society in Glasgow, \"The Constitution of the United States: Is It Pro-Slavery or Antislavery?\", outlining his views on the American Constitution. That month, on the 13th, Douglass' youngest daughter Annie died in Rochester, New York, just days shy of her 11th birthday. Douglass sailed back from England the following month, traveling through Canada to avoid detection.\nPhotography.\nDouglass considered photography very important in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even in the hands of a racist white, as photographs were an excellent counter to the many racist caricatures, particularly in blackface minstrelsy. He was the most photographed American of the 19th century, consciously using photography to advance his political views. He never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature of a happy slave. He tended to look directly into the camera to confront the viewer, with a stern look.\nReligious views.\nAs a child, Douglass was exposed to a number of religious sermons, and in his youth, he sometimes heard Sophia Auld reading the Bible. In time, he became interested in literacy; he began reading and copying bible verses, and he eventually converted to Christianity. He described this approach in his last biography, \"Life and Times of Frederick Douglass\":\nI was not more than thirteen years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to \"cast all my care upon God.\" This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.\nDouglass was mentored by Rev. Charles Lawson, and, early in his activism, he often included biblical allusions and religious metaphors in his speeches. Although a believer, he strongly criticized religious hypocrisy and accused slaveholders of \"wickedness\", lack of morality, and failure to follow the Golden Rule. In this sense, Douglass distinguished between the \"Christianity of Christ\" and the \"Christianity of America\" and considered religious slaveholders and clergymen who defended slavery as the most brutal, sinful, and cynical of all who represented \"wolves in sheep's clothing\".\nNotably, in a famous oration given in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester, he sharply criticized the attitude of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and held that religious ministers committed a \"blasphemy\" when they taught it as sanctioned by religion. He considered that a law passed to support slavery was \"one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty\" and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church \"stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form\", and \"an abomination in the sight of God\". Of ministers like John Chase Lord, Leonard Elijah Lathrop, Ichabod Spencer, and Orville Dewey, he said that they taught, against the Scriptures, that \"we ought to obey man's law before the law of God\". He further asserted, \"in speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States ... Henry Ward Beecher of Brooklyn, Samuel J. May of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend [Robert R. Raymonde]\". He maintained that \"upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains\". In addition, he called religious people to embrace abolitionism, stating, \"let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds.\"\nDuring his visits to the United Kingdom between 1846 and 1848, Douglass asked British Christians never to support American churches that permitted slavery, and he expressed his happiness to know that a group of ministers in Belfast had refused to admit slaveholders as members of the Church.\nOn his return to the United States, Douglass founded the \"North Star\", a weekly publication with the motto \"Right is of no sex, Truth is of no color, God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren.\" Douglass later wrote a letter to his former slaveholder, in which he denounced him for leaving Douglass's family illiterate:\nSometimes considered a precursor of a non-denominational liberation theology, Douglass was a deeply spiritual man, as his home continues to show. The fireplace mantle features busts of two of his favorite philosophers, David Friedrich Strauss, author of \"The Life of Jesus\", and Ludwig Feuerbach, author of \"The Essence of Christianity\". In addition to several Bibles and books about various religions in the library, images of angels and Jesus are displayed, as well as interior and exterior photographs of Washington's Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. Throughout his life, Douglass had linked that individual experience with social reform, and like other Christian abolitionists, he followed practices such as abstaining from tobacco, alcohol and other substances that he believed corrupted body and soul.\nCivil War years.\nBefore the Civil War.\nBy the time of the Civil War, Douglass was one of the most famous black men in the country, known for his orations on the condition of the black race and on other issues such as women's rights. His eloquence gathered crowds at every location. His reception by leaders in England and Ireland added to his stature.\nFight for emancipation and suffrage.\nDouglass and the abolitionists argued that because the aim of the Civil War was to end slavery, African Americans should be allowed to engage in the fight for their freedom. Douglass publicized this view in his newspapers and several speeches. In August 1861 he published an account of the First Battle of Bull Run, noting that some blacks were already in the Confederate ranks. A few weeks later, Douglass brought the subject up again, quoting a witness to the battle who said they saw black Confederates \"with muskets on their shoulders and bullets in their pockets.\" Douglass conferred with President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 on the treatment of black soldiers, and with President Andrew Johnson on the subject of black suffrage.\nPresident Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of all slaves in Confederate-held territory. (Slaves in Union-held areas were not covered by this war-measures act; slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with the adoption of the 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: \"We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by the dim light of the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries.\"\nDuring the U.S. Presidential Election of 1864, Douglass supported John C. Fr\u00e9mont, who was the candidate of the abolitionist Radical Democracy Party. Douglass was disappointed that President Lincoln did not publicly endorse suffrage for black freedmen. Douglass believed that since African-American men were fighting for the Union in the American Civil War, they deserved the right to vote.\nWith the North no longer obliged to return slaves to their owners in the South, Douglass fought for equality for his people. He made plans with Lincoln to move liberated slaves out of the South. During the war, Douglass also helped the Union cause by serving as a recruiter for the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. His eldest son, Charles Douglass, joined the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, but was ill for much of his service. Lewis Douglass fought at the Battle of Fort Wagner. Another son, Frederick Douglass Jr., also served as a recruiter.\nAfter Lincoln's death.\nThe post-war (1865) ratification of the 13th Amendment outlawed slavery. The 14th Amendment provided for citizenship and equal protection under the law. The 15th Amendment protected all citizens from being discriminated against in voting because of race.\nOn April 14, 1876, Douglass delivered the keynote speech at the unveiling of the Emancipation Memorial in Washington's Lincoln Park. He spoke frankly about Lincoln, noting what he perceived as both positive and negative attributes of the late President. Calling Lincoln \"the white man's president\", Douglass criticized Lincoln's tardiness in joining the cause of emancipation, noting that Lincoln initially opposed the expansion of slavery but did not support its elimination. But Douglass also asked, \"Can any colored man, or any white man friendly to the freedom of all men, ever forget the night which followed the first day of January 1863, when the world was to see if Abraham Lincoln would prove to be as good as his word?\" He also said: \"Though Mr. Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow-countrymen against the Negro, it is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts he loathed and hated slavery ...\"\nThe crowd, roused by his speech, gave Douglass a standing ovation. Lincoln's widow Mary Lincoln supposedly gave Lincoln's favorite walking-stick to Douglass in appreciation. That walking-stick still rests in his final residence, \"Cedar Hill\", now preserved as the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site.\nAfter delivering the speech, Frederick Douglass immediately wrote to the National Republican newspaper in Washington (which published five days later, 19 April), criticizing the statue's design and suggesting the park could be improved by more dignified monuments of free Black people. \u201cThe negro here, though rising, is still on his knees and nude,\u201d Douglass wrote. \u201cWhat I want to see before I die is a monument representing the negro, not couchant on his knees like a four-footed animal, but erect on his feet like a man.\u201d\nReconstruction era.\nAfter the Civil War, Douglass continued to work for equality for African-Americans and women. Due to his prominence and activism during the war, Douglass received several political appointments. He served as president of the Reconstruction-era Freedman's Savings Bank.\nMeanwhile, white insurgents had quickly arisen in the South after the war, organizing first as secret vigilante groups, including the Ku Klux Klan. Armed insurgency took different forms. Powerful paramilitary groups included the White League and the Red Shirts, both active during the 1870s in the Deep South. They operated as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\", turning out Republican officeholders and disrupting elections. Starting 10 years after the war, Democrats regained political power in every state of the former Confederacy and began to reassert white supremacy. They enforced this by a combination of violence, late 19th-century laws imposing segregation and a concerted effort to disfranchise African Americans. New labor and criminal laws also limited their freedom.\nTo combat these efforts, Douglass supported the presidential campaign of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868. In 1870, Douglass started his last newspaper, the \"New National Era\", attempting to hold his country to its commitment to equality. President Grant sent a Congressionally sponsored commission, accompanied by Douglass, on a mission to the West Indies to investigate if the annexation of Santo Domingo would be good for the United States. Grant believed annexation would help relieve the violent situation in the South by allowing African Americans their own state. Douglass and the commission favored annexation, however, Congress remained opposed to annexation. Douglass criticized Senator Charles Sumner, who opposed annexation, stating if Sumner continued to oppose annexation he would \"regard him as the worst foe the colored race has on this continent.\"\nAfter the midterm elections, Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (also known as the Klan Act), and the second and third Enforcement Acts. Grant used their provisions vigorously, suspending \"habeas corpus\" in South Carolina and sending troops there and into other states. Under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made. Grant's vigor in disrupting the Klan made him unpopular among many whites, but earned praise from Douglass. A Douglass associate wrote that African Americans \"will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of [Grant's] name, fame and great services.\"\nIn 1872, Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States, as Victoria Woodhull's running mate on the Equal Rights Party ticket. He was nominated without his knowledge. Douglass neither campaigned for the ticket nor acknowledged that he had been nominated. In that year, he was presidential elector at large for the State of New York, and took that state's votes to Washington, D.C.\nHowever, in early June of that year, Douglass' third Rochester home, on South Avenue, burned down; arson was suspected. There was extensive damage to the house, its furnishings, and the grounds; in addition, sixteen volumes of the \"North Star\" and \"Frederick Douglass' Paper\" were lost. Douglass then moved to Washington, D.C.\nThroughout the Reconstruction era, Douglass continued speaking, emphasizing the importance of work, voting rights and actual exercise of suffrage. His speeches for the twenty-five years following the war emphasized work to counter the racism that was then prevalent in unions. In a 15 November 1867 speech he said \"A man's rights rest in three boxes. The ballot box, jury box and the cartridge box. Let no man be kept from the ballot box because of his color. Let no woman be kept from the ballot box because of her sex.\" Douglass spoke at many colleges around the country, including Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, in 1873.\nFamily life.\nDouglass and Anna Murray had five children: Rosetta Douglass, Lewis Henry Douglass, Frederick Douglass Jr., Charles Remond Douglass, and Annie Douglass (died at the age of ten). Charles and Rosetta helped produce his newspapers.\nAnna Douglass remained a loyal supporter of her husband's public work. His relationships with Julia Griffiths and Ottilie Assing, two women with whom he was professionally involved, caused recurring speculation and scandals. Assing was a journalist recently immigrated from Germany, who first visited Douglass in 1856 seeking permission to translate \"My Bondage and My Freedom\" into German. Until 1872, she often stayed at his house \"for several months at a time\" as his \"intellectual and emotional companion.\" Assing held Anna Douglass \"in utter contempt\" and was vainly hoping that Douglass would separate from his wife. Douglass biographer David W. Blight concludes that Assing and Douglass \"were probably lovers.\"\nAfter Anna died in 1882, in 1884 Douglass married again, to Helen Pitts, a white suffragist and abolitionist from Honeoye, New York. Pitts was the daughter of Gideon Pitts Jr., an abolitionist colleague and friend of Douglass. A graduate of Mount Holyoke College (then called Mount Holyoke Female Seminary), Pitts worked on a radical feminist publication named \"Alpha\" while living in Washington, D.C. She later worked as Douglass' secretary.\nTheir marriage provoked a storm of controversy, since Pitts was both white and nearly 20 years younger. Her family stopped speaking to her; his children considered the marriage a repudiation of their mother. But feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton congratulated the couple. Douglass responded to the criticisms by saying that his first marriage had been to someone the color of his mother, and his second to someone the color of his father.\nFinal years in Washington, D.C..\nThe Freedman's Savings Bank went bankrupt on June 29, 1874, just a few months after Douglass became its president in late March. During that same economic crisis, his final newspaper, \"The New National Era\", failed in September. When Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was elected president, he named Douglass as United States Marshal for the District of Columbia, the first person of color to be so named. The Senate voted to confirm him on 17 March 1877. Douglass accepted the appoint, which helped assure his family's financial security. During his tenure, Douglass was urged by his supporters to resign from his commission, since he was never asked to introduce visiting foreign dignitaries to the President, which is one of the usual duties of that post. However, Douglass believed that no covert racism was implied by the omission, and stated that he was always warmly welcomed in presidential circles.\nIn 1877, Douglass visited Thomas Auld on his deathbed, and the two men reconciled. Douglass had met Auld's daughter, Amanda Auld Sears, some years prior; she had requested the meeting and had subsequently attended and cheered one of Douglass' speeches. Her father complimented her for reaching out to Douglass. The visit also appears to have brought closure to Douglass, although some criticized his effort.\nThat same year, Douglass bought the house that was to be the family's final home in Washington, D.C., on a hill above the Anacostia River. He and Anna named it \"Cedar Hill\" (also spelled \"CedarHill\"). They expanded the house from 14 to 21 rooms, and included a china closet. One year later, Douglass purchased adjoining lots and expanded the property to 15\u00a0acres (61,000\u00a0m2). The home is now preserved as the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site.\nIn 1881, Douglass published the final edition of his autobiography, \"The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass\". That year he was appointed as Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia. His wife Anna Murray Douglass died in 1882, leaving the widower devastated. After a period of mourning, Douglass found new meaning from working with activist Ida B. Wells. He remarried in 1884, as mentioned above.\nDouglass also continued his speaking engagements and travel, both in the United States and abroad. With new wife Helen, Douglass traveled to England, Ireland, France, Italy, Egypt and Greece from 1886 to 1887. He became known for advocating Irish Home Rule and supported Charles Stewart Parnell in Ireland.\nIn addition to his travel abroad during those years, he lectured in small towns in the United States. On December 28, 1885, the aging orator spoke to the literary society in Rising Sun, a town in northeastern Maryland below the Mason\u2013Dixon line. The program, \"The Self-Made Man,\" attracted a large audience including students from Lincoln University in Chester County, PA, the Oxford Press reported. \"Mr. Douglass is growing old and has lost much of his fire and vigor of mind as well as body, but he is still able to interest an audience. He is a remarkable man and is a bright example of the capability of the colored race, even under the blighting influence of slavery, from which he emerged and became one of the distinguished citizens of the country,\" the Chester County PA newspaper remarked.\nAt the 1888 Republican National Convention, Douglass became the first African American to receive a vote for President of the United States in a major party's roll call vote. That year, Douglass spoke at Claflin College, a historically black college in Orangeburg, South Carolina, and the state's oldest such institution.\nMany African Americans, called Exodusters, escaped the Klan and racially discriminatory laws in the South by moving to Kansas, where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the Back-to-Africa movement. He thought the latter resembled the American Colonization Society which he had opposed in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks to stick it out. He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position. Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, \"I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot shut my eyes to the ugly facts before me.\"\nPresident Harrison appointed Douglass as the United States's minister resident and consul-general to the Republic of Haiti and Charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Santo Domingo in 1889. but Douglass resigned the commission in July 1891 when it became apparent that the American President was intent upon gaining permanent access to Haitian territory regardless of that country's desires. In 1892, Haiti made Douglass a co-commissioner of its pavilion at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\nIn 1892, Douglass constructed rental housing for blacks, now known as Douglass Place, in the Fells Point area of Baltimore. The complex still exists, and in 2003 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nDeath.\nOn February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a meeting of the National Council of Women in Washington, D.C. During that meeting, he was brought to the platform and received a standing ovation. Shortly after he returned home, Douglass died of a massive heart attack. He was 77.\nHis funeral was held at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. Thousands of people passed by his coffin to show their respect. Although Douglass had attended several churches in the nation's capital, he had a pew here and had donated two standing candelabras when this church had moved to a new building in 1886. He also gave many lectures there, including his last major speech, \"The Lesson of the Hour.\"\nDouglass' coffin was transported to Rochester, New York, where he had lived for 25 years, longer than anywhere else in his life. He was buried next to Anna in the Douglass family plot of Mount Hope Cemetery. Helen was also buried there in 1903.\nLegacy and honors.\nRoy Finkenbine argues:\nThe most influential African American of the nineteenth century, Douglass made a career of agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: \u2033Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!\u2033\nThe Episcopal Church (USA) remembers Douglass annually on its liturgical calendar for February 20, the anniversary of his death. Many public schools have also been named in his honor. Douglass still has living descendants today, such as Ken Morris, who is also a descendant of Booker T. Washington. Other honors and remembrances include:"}
{"id": "11034", "revid": "12897086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11034", "title": "Fluid dynamics", "text": "In physics and engineering, fluid dynamics is a subdiscipline of fluid mechanics that describes the flow of fluids\u2014liquids and gases. It has several subdisciplines, including aerodynamics (the study of air and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of liquids in motion). Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting weather patterns, understanding nebulae in interstellar space and modelling fission weapon detonation.\nFluid dynamics offers a systematic structure\u2014which underlies these practical disciplines\u2014that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow measurement and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as flow velocity, pressure, density, and temperature, as functions of space and time.\nBefore the twentieth century, \"hydrodynamics\" was synonymous with fluid dynamics. This is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like magnetohydrodynamics and hydrodynamic stability, both of which can also be applied to gases.\nEquations.\nThe foundational axioms of fluid dynamics are the conservation laws, specifically, conservation of mass, conservation of linear momentum, and conservation of energy (also known as First Law of Thermodynamics). These are based on classical mechanics and are modified in quantum mechanics and general relativity. They are expressed using the Reynolds transport theorem.\nIn addition to the above, fluids are assumed to obey the continuum assumption. Fluids are composed of molecules that collide with one another and solid objects. However, the continuum assumption assumes that fluids are continuous, rather than discrete. Consequently, it is assumed that properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and flow velocity are well-defined at infinitesimally small points in space and vary continuously from one point to another. The fact that the fluid is made up of discrete molecules is ignored.\nFor fluids that are sufficiently dense to be a continuum, do not contain ionized species, and have flow velocities small in relation to the speed of light, the momentum equations for Newtonian fluids are the Navier\u2013Stokes equations\u2014which is a non-linear set of differential equations that describes the flow of a fluid whose stress depends linearly on flow velocity gradients and pressure. The unsimplified equations do not have a general closed-form solution, so they are primarily of use in computational fluid dynamics. The equations can be simplified in a number of ways, all of which make them easier to solve. Some of the simplifications allow some simple fluid dynamics problems to be solved in closed form.\nIn addition to the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, a thermodynamic equation of state that gives the pressure as a function of other thermodynamic variables is required to completely describe the problem. An example of this would be the perfect gas equation of state:\nwhere is pressure, is density, the absolute temperature, while is the gas constant and is molar mass for a particular gas.\nConservation laws.\nThree conservation laws are used to solve fluid dynamics problems, and may be written in integral or differential form. The conservation laws may be applied to a region of the flow called a \"control volume\". A control volume is a discrete volume in space through which fluid is assumed to flow. The integral formulations of the conservation laws are used to describe the change of mass, momentum, or energy within the control volume. Differential formulations of the conservation laws apply Stokes' theorem to yield an expression which may be interpreted as the integral form of the law applied to an infinitesimally small volume (at a point) within the flow.\nCompressible versus incompressible flow.\nAll fluids are compressible to an extent; that is, changes in pressure or temperature cause changes in density. However, in many situations the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an incompressible flow. Otherwise the more general compressible flow equations must be used.\nMathematically, incompressibility is expressed by saying that the density of a fluid parcel does not change as it moves in the flow field, that is,\nwhere is the material derivative, which is the sum of local and convective derivatives. This additional constraint simplifies the governing equations, especially in the case when the fluid has a uniform density.\nFor flow of gases, to determine whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the Mach number of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3. For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the actual flow pressure becomes). Acoustic problems always require allowing compressibility, since sound waves are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.\nNewtonian versus non-Newtonian fluids.\nAll fluids are viscous, meaning that they exert some resistance to deformation: neighbouring parcels of fluid moving at different velocities exert viscous forces on each other. The velocity gradient is referred to as a strain rate; it has dimensions . Isaac Newton showed that for many familiar fluids such as water and air, the stress due to these viscous forces is linearly related to the strain rate. Such fluids are called Newtonian fluids. The coefficient of proportionality is called the fluid's viscosity; for Newtonian fluids, it is a fluid property that is independent of the strain rate.\nNon-Newtonian fluids have a more complicated, non-linear stress-strain behaviour. The sub-discipline of rheology describes the stress-strain behaviours of such fluids, which include emulsions and slurries, some viscoelastic materials such as blood and some polymers, and \"sticky liquids\" such as latex, honey and lubricants.\nInviscid versus viscous versus Stokes flow.\nThe dynamic of fluid parcels is described with the help of Newton's second law. An accelerating parcel of fluid is subject to inertial effects.\nThe Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity which characterises the magnitude of inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number () indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called Stokes or creeping flow.\nIn contrast, high Reynolds numbers () indicate that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an inviscid flow, an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the Navier\u2013Stokes equations to be simplified into the Euler equations. The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields Bernoulli's equation. When, in addition to being inviscid, the flow is irrotational everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called potential flows, because the velocity field may be expressed as the gradient of a potential energy expression.\nThis idea can work fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, problems such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the no-slip condition generates a thin region of large strain rate, the boundary layer, in which viscosity effects dominate and which thus generates vorticity. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), viscous flow equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict drag forces, a limitation known as the d'Alembert's paradox.\nA commonly used model, especially in computational fluid dynamics, is to use two flow models: the Euler equations away from the body, and boundary layer equations in a region close to the body. The two solutions can then be matched with each other, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions.\nSteady versus unsteady flow.\nA flow that is not a function of time is called steady flow. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as unsteady (also called transient). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a sphere is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady.\nTurbulent flows are unsteady by definition. A turbulent flow can, however, be statistically stationary. The random velocity field is statistically stationary if all statistics are invariant under a shift in time. This roughly means that all statistical properties are constant in time. Often, the mean field is the object of interest, and this is constant too in a statistically stationary flow.\nSteady flows are often more tractable than otherwise similar unsteady flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without taking advantage of the steadiness of the flow field.\nLaminar versus turbulent flow.\nTurbulence is flow characterized by recirculation, eddies, and apparent randomness. Flow in which turbulence is not exhibited is called laminar. The presence of eddies or recirculation alone does not necessarily indicate turbulent flow\u2014these phenomena may be present in laminar flow as well. Mathematically, turbulent flow is often represented via a Reynolds decomposition, in which the flow is broken down into the sum of an average component and a perturbation component.\nIt is believed that turbulent flows can be described well through the use of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. Direct numerical simulation (DNS), based on the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, makes it possible to simulate turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. Restrictions depend on the power of the computer used and the efficiency of the solution algorithm. The results of DNS have been found to agree well with experimental data for some flows.\nMost flows of interest have Reynolds numbers much too high for DNS to be a viable option, given the state of computational power for the next few decades. Any flight vehicle large enough to carry a human ( &gt; 3\u00a0m), moving faster than is well beyond the limit of DNS simulation ( = 4\u00a0million). Transport aircraft wings (such as on an Airbus A300 or Boeing 747) have Reynolds numbers of 40 million (based on the wing chord dimension). Solving these real-life flow problems requires turbulence models for the foreseeable future. Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations (RANS) combined with turbulence modelling provides a model of the effects of the turbulent flow. Such a modelling mainly provides the additional momentum transfer by the Reynolds stresses, although the turbulence also enhances the heat and mass transfer. Another promising methodology is large eddy simulation (LES), especially in the guise of detached eddy simulation (DES)\u2014which is a combination of RANS turbulence modelling and large eddy simulation.\nSubsonic versus transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flows.\nWhile many flows (such as flow of water through a pipe) occur at low Mach numbers, many flows of practical interest in aerodynamics or in turbomachines occur at high fractions of (transonic flows) or in excess of it (supersonic or even hypersonic flows). New phenomena occur at these regimes such as instabilities in transonic flow, shock waves for supersonic flow, or non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in hypersonic flows. In practice, each of those flow regimes is treated separately.\nReactive versus non-reactive flows.\nReactive flows are flows that are chemically reactive, which finds its applications in many areas, including combustion (IC engine), propulsion devices (rockets, jet engines, and so on), detonations, fire and safety hazards, and astrophysics. In addition to conservation of mass, momentum and energy, conservation of individual species (for example, mass fraction of methane in methane combustion) need to be derived, where the production/depletion rate of any species are obtained by simultaneously solving the equations of chemical kinetics.\nMagnetohydrodynamics.\nMagnetohydrodynamics is the multidisciplinary study of the flow of electrically conducting fluids in electromagnetic fields. Examples of such fluids include plasmas, liquid metals, and salt water. The fluid flow equations are solved simultaneously with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.\nRelativistic fluid dynamics.\nRelativistic fluid dynamics studies the macroscopic and microscopic fluid motion at large velocities comparable to the velocity of light. This branch of fluid dynamics accounts for the relativistic effects both from the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity. The governing equations are derived in Riemannian geometry for Minkowski spacetime.\nOther approximations.\nThere are a large number of other possible approximations to fluid dynamic problems. Some of the more commonly used are listed below.\nTerminology.\nThe concept of pressure is central to the study of both fluid statics and fluid dynamics. A pressure can be identified for every point in a body of fluid, regardless of whether the fluid is in motion or not. Pressure can be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube, mercury column, or various other methods.\nSome of the terminology that is necessary in the study of fluid dynamics is not found in other similar areas of study. In particular, some of the terminology used in fluid dynamics is not used in fluid statics.\nTerminology in incompressible fluid dynamics.\nThe concepts of total pressure and dynamic pressure arise from Bernoulli's equation and are significant in the study of all fluid flows. (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual sense\u2014they cannot be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube or mercury column.) To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to pressure in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term static pressure to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure. Static pressure is identical to pressure and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field.\nA point in a fluid flow where the flow has come to rest (that is to say, speed is equal to zero adjacent to some solid body immersed in the fluid flow) is of special significance. It is of such importance that it is given a special name\u2014a stagnation point. The static pressure at the stagnation point is of special significance and is given its own name\u2014stagnation pressure. In incompressible flows, the stagnation pressure at a stagnation point is equal to the total pressure throughout the flow field.\nTerminology in compressible fluid dynamics.\nIn a compressible fluid, it is convenient to define the total conditions (also called stagnation conditions) for all thermodynamic state properties (such as total temperature, total enthalpy, total speed of sound). These total flow conditions are a function of the fluid velocity and have different values in frames of reference with different motion.\nTo avoid potential ambiguity when referring to the properties of the fluid associated with the state of the fluid rather than its motion, the prefix \"static\" is commonly used (such as static temperature and static enthalpy). Where there is no prefix, the fluid property is the static condition (so \"density\" and \"static density\" mean the same thing). The static conditions are independent of the frame of reference.\nBecause the total flow conditions are defined by isentropically bringing the fluid to rest, there is no need to distinguish between total entropy and static entropy as they are always equal by definition. As such, entropy is most commonly referred to as simply \"entropy\"."}

Fins typically function as foils that produce lift or thrust, or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water, air, or other fluids. Fins are also used to increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes, or simply as ornamentation.\nFins first evolved on fish as a means of locomotion. Fish fins are used to generate thrust and control the subsequent motion. Fish, and other aquatic animals such as cetaceans, actively propel and steer themselves with pectoral and tail fins. As they swim, they use other fins, such as dorsal and anal fins, to achieve stability and refine their maneuvering.\nThe fins on the tails of cetaceans, ichthyosaurs, metriorhynchids, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs are called flukes.\nGenerating thrust.\nFoil shaped fins generate thrust when moved, the lift of the fin sets water or air in motion and pushes the fin in the opposite direction. Aquatic animals get significant thrust by moving fins back and forth in water. Often the tail fin is used, but some aquatic animals generate thrust from pectoral fins. Fins can also generate thrust if they are rotated in air or water. Turbines and propellers (and sometimes fans and pumps) use a number of rotating fins, also called foils, wings, arms or blades. Propellers use the fins to translate torquing force to lateral thrust, thus propelling an aircraft or ship. Turbines work in reverse, using the lift of the blades to generate torque and power from moving gases or water.\nCavitation can be a problem with high power applications, resulting in damage to propellers or turbines, as well as noise and loss of power. Cavitation occurs when negative pressure causes bubbles (cavities) to form in a liquid, which then promptly and violently collapse. It can cause significant damage and wear. Cavitation damage can also occur to the tail fins of powerful swimming marine animals, such as dolphins and tuna. Cavitation is more likely to occur near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is relatively low. Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful. Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.\nScombrid fishes (tuna, mackerel and bonito) are particularly high-performance swimmers. Along the margin at the rear of their bodies is a line of small rayless, non-retractable fins, known as finlets. There has been much speculation about the function of these finlets. Research done in 2000 and 2001 by Nauen and Lauder indicated that \"the finlets have a hydrodynamic effect on local flow during steady swimming\" and that \"the most posterior finlet is oriented to redirect flow into the developing tail vortex, which may increase thrust produced by the tail of swimming mackerel\".\nFish use multiple fins, so it is possible that a given fin can have a hydrodynamic interaction with another fin. In particular, the fins immediately upstream of the caudal (tail) fin may be proximate fins that can directly affect the flow dynamics at the caudal fin. In 2011, researchers using volumetric imaging techniques were able to generate \"the first instantaneous three-dimensional views of wake structures as they are produced by freely swimming fishes\". They found that \"continuous tail beats resulted in the formation of a linked chain of vortex rings\" and that \"the dorsal and anal fin wakes are rapidly entrained by the caudal fin wake, approximately within the timeframe of a subsequent tail beat\".\nControlling motion.\nOnce motion has been established, the motion itself can be controlled with the use of other fins. Boats control direction (yaw) with fin-like rudders, and roll with stabilizer fins and keel fins. Airplanes achieve similar results with small specialised fins that change the shape of their wings and tail fins.\nStabilising fins are used as fletching on arrows and some darts, and at the rear of some bombs, missiles, rockets, and self-propelled torpedoes. These are typically planar and shaped like small wings, although grid fins are sometimes used. Static fins have also been used for one satellite, GOCE.\nRegulating temperature.\nEngineering fins are also used as heat transfer fins to regulate temperature in heat sinks or fin radiators.\nOrnamentation and other uses.\nIn biology, fins can have an adaptive significance as sexual ornaments. During courtship, the female cichlid, \"Pelvicachromis taeniatus\", displays a large and visually arresting purple pelvic fin. \"The researchers found that males clearly preferred females with a larger pelvic fin and that pelvic fins grew in a more disproportionate way than other fins on female fish.\"\nReshaping human feet with swim fins, rather like the tail fin of a fish, add thrust and efficiency to the kicks of a swimmer or underwater diver Surfboard fins provide surfers with means to maneuver and control their boards. Contemporary surfboards often have a centre fin and two cambered side fins.\nThe bodies of reef fishes are often shaped differently from open water fishes. Open water fishes are usually built for speed, streamlined like torpedoes to minimise friction as they move through the water. Reef fish operate in the relatively confined spaces and complex underwater landscapes of coral reefs. For this manoeuvrability is more important than straight line speed, so coral reef fish have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. They outwit predators by dodging into fissures in the reef or playing hide and seek around coral heads. The pectoral and pelvic fins of many reef fish, such as butterflyfish, damselfish and angelfish, have evolved so they can act as brakes and allow complex maneuvers. Many reef fish, such as butterflyfish, damselfish and angelfish, have evolved bodies which are deep and laterally compressed like a pancake, and will fit into fissures in rocks. Their pelvic and pectoral fins are designed differently, so they act together with the flattened body to optimise maneuverability. Some fishes, such as puffer fish, filefish and trunkfish, rely on pectoral fins for swimming and hardly use tail fins at all.\nEvolution of fins.\nThere is an old theory, proposed by anatomist Karl Gegenbaur,which has been often disregarded in science textbooks, \"that fins and (later) limbs evolved from the gills of an extinct vertebrate\". Gaps in the fossil record had not allowed a definitive conclusion. In 2009, researchers from the University of Chicago found evidence that the \"genetic architecture of gills, fins and limbs is the same\", and that \"the skeleton of any appendage off the body of an animal is probably patterned by the developmental genetic program that we have traced back to formation of gills in sharks\". Recent studies support the idea that gill arches and paired fins are serially homologous and thus that fins may have evolved from gill tissues.\nFish are the ancestors of all mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians. In particular, terrestrial tetrapods (four-legged animals) evolved from fish and made their first forays onto land 400 million years ago. They used paired pectoral and pelvic fins for locomotion. The pectoral fins developed into forelegs (arms in the case of humans) and the pelvic fins developed into hind legs. Much of the genetic machinery that builds a walking limb in a tetrapod is already present in the swimming fin of a fish.\nIn 2011, researchers at Monash University in Australia used primitive but still living lungfish \"to trace the evolution of pelvic fin muscles to find out how the load-bearing hind limbs of the tetrapods evolved.\" Further research at the University of Chicago found bottom-walking lungfishes had already evolved characteristics of the walking gaits of terrestrial tetrapods.\nIn a classic example of convergent evolution, the pectoral limbs of pterosaurs, birds and bats further evolved along independent paths into flying wings. Even with flying wings there are many similarities with walking legs, and core aspects of the genetic blueprint of the pectoral fin have been retained.\nAbout 200 million years ago the first mammals appeared. A group of these mammals started returning to the sea about 52 million years ago, thus completing a circle. These are the cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises). Recent DNA analysis suggests that cetaceans evolved from within the even-toed ungulates, and that they share a common ancestor with the hippopotamus. About 23 million years ago another group of bearlike land mammals started returning to the sea. These were the seals. What had become walking limbs in cetaceans and seals evolved further, independently in a reverse form of convergent evolution, back to new forms of swimming fins. The forelimbs became flippers and the hind limbs became a tail terminating in two fins, called a fluke in the case of cetaceans. Fish tails are usually vertical and move from side to side. Cetacean flukes are horizontal and move up and down, because cetacean spines bend the same way as in other mammals.\nIchthyosaurs are ancient reptiles that resembled dolphins. They first appeared about 245 million years ago and disappeared about 90 million years ago.\n\"This sea-going reptile with terrestrial ancestors converged so strongly on fishes that it actually evolved a dorsal fin and tail in just the right place and with just the right hydrological design. These structures are all the more remarkable because they evolved from nothing \u2014 the ancestral terrestrial reptile had no hump on its back or blade on its tail to serve as a precursor.\"\nThe biologist Stephen Jay Gould said the ichthyosaur was his favorite example of convergent evolution.\nRobotic fins.\nThe use of fins for the propulsion of aquatic animals can be remarkably effective. It has been calculated that some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than 90%. Fish can accelerate and maneuver much more effectively than boats or submarine, and produce less water disturbance and noise. This has led to biomimetic studies of underwater robots which attempt to emulate the locomotion of aquatic animals. An example is the Robot Tuna built by the Institute of Field Robotics, to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion. In 2005, the Sea Life London Aquarium displayed three robotic fish created by the computer science department at the University of Essex. The fish were designed to be autonomous, swimming around and avoiding obstacles like real fish. Their creator claimed that he was trying to combine \"the speed of tuna, acceleration of a pike, and the navigating skills of an eel.\"\nThe \"AquaPenguin\", developed by Festo of Germany, copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front flippers of penguins. Festo also developed \"AquaRay\", \"AquaJelly\" and \"AiraCuda\", respectively emulating the locomotion of manta rays, jellyfish and barracuda.\nIn 2004, Hugh Herr at MIT prototyped a biomechatronic robotic fish with a living actuator by surgically transplanting muscles from frog legs to the robot and then making the robot swim by pulsing the muscle fibers with electricity.\nRobotic fish offer some research advantages, such as the ability to examine an individual part of a fish design in isolation from the rest of the fish. However, this risks oversimplifying the biology so key aspects of the animal design are overlooked. Robotic fish also allow researchers to vary a single parameter, such as flexibility or a specific motion control. Researchers can directly measure forces, which is not easy to do in live fish. \"Robotic devices also facilitate three-dimensional kinematic studies and correlated hydrodynamic analyses, as the location of the locomotor surface can be known accurately. And, individual components of a natural motion (such as outstroke vs. instroke of a flapping appendage) can be programmed separately, which is certainly difficult to achieve when working with a live animal.\""}
{"id": "11037", "revid": "35930533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11037", "title": "Freyr", "text": "Freyr (Old Norse: Lord), sometimes anglicized as Frey, is a widely attested god in Norse mythology, associated with sacral kingship, virility, peace and prosperity, with sunshine and fair weather, and with good harvest. Freyr, sometimes referred to as Yngvi-Freyr, was especially associated with Sweden and seen as an ancestor of the Swedish royal house. According to Adam of Bremen, Freyr was associated with peace and pleasure, and was represented with a phallic statue in the Temple at Uppsala. According to Snorri Sturluson, Freyr was \"the most renowned of the \u00e6sir\", and was venerated for good harvest and peace.\nIn the mythological stories in the Icelandic books the \"Poetic Edda\" and the \"Prose Edda\", Freyr is presented as one of the Vanir, the son of the god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and his sister-wife as well as the twin brother of the goddess Freyja. The gods gave him \u00c1lfheimr, the realm of the Elves, as a teething present. He rides the shining dwarf-made boar Gullinbursti and possesses the ship Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir which always has a favorable breeze and can be folded together and carried in a pouch when it is not being used. Freyr is also known to have been associated with the horse cult. He also kept sacred horses in his sanctuary at Trondheim in Norway. He has the servants Sk\u00edrnir, Byggvir and Beyla.\nThe most extensive surviving Freyr myth relates Freyr's falling in love with the female j\u00f6tunn Ger\u00f0r. Eventually, she becomes his wife but first Freyr has to give away his sword which fights on its own \"if wise be he who wields it.\" Although deprived of this weapon, Freyr defeats the j\u00f6tunn Beli with an antler. However, lacking his sword, Freyr will be killed by the fire j\u00f6tunn Surtr during the events of Ragnar\u00f6k.\nLike other Germanic deities, veneration of Freyr is revived during the modern period through the Heathenry movement.\nName.\nThe Old Norse name \"Freyr\" ('lord') stems from a Proto-Norse form reconstructed as based upon the attested runic inscriptions (c. 800 AD) and (from an earlier ). Deriving ultimately from Proto-Germanic \"*frawj\u014dn\" ('lord'), it is cognate with Gothic , Old English , or Old High German , all meaning 'lord, master'.\nAdam of Bremen.\nWritten 1080, one of the oldest written sources on pre-Christian Scandinavian religious practices is Adam of Bremen's \"Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum\". Adam claimed to have access to first-hand accounts on pagan practices in Sweden. He refers to Freyr with the Latinized name Fricco and mentions that an image of him at Skara was destroyed by the Christian missionary, Bishop Egino. Adam's description of the Temple at Uppsala gives some details on the god.\nLater in the account Adam states that when a marriage is performed a libation is made to the image of Fricco.\nHistorians are divided on the reliability of Adam's account.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nWhen Snorri Sturluson was writing in 13th century Iceland, the indigenous Germanic gods were still remembered although they had not been openly worshiped for more than two centuries.\n\"Gylfaginning\".\nIn the \"Gylfaginning\" section of his \"Prose Edda\", Snorri introduces Freyr as one of the major gods.\nThis description has similarities to the older account by Adam of Bremen but the differences are interesting. Adam assigns control of the weather and produce of the fields to Thor but Snorri says that Freyr rules over those areas. Snorri also omits any explicitly sexual references in Freyr's description. Those discrepancies can be explained in several ways. It is possible that the Norse gods did not have exactly the same roles in Icelandic and Swedish paganism but it must also be remembered that Adam and Snorri were writing with different goals in mind. Either Snorri or Adam may also have had distorted information.\nThe only extended myth related about Freyr in the \"Prose Edda\" is the story of his marriage.\nThe woman is Ger\u00f0r, a beautiful giantess. Freyr immediately falls in love with her and becomes depressed and taciturn. After a period of brooding, he consents to talk to Sk\u00edrnir, his foot-page. He tells Sk\u00edrnir that he has fallen in love with a beautiful woman and thinks he will die if he cannot have her. He asks Sk\u00edrnir to go and woo her for him.\nThe loss of Freyr's sword has consequences. According to the \"Prose Edda\", Freyr had to fight Beli without his sword and slew him with an antler. But the result at Ragnar\u00f6k, the end of the world, will be much more serious. Freyr is fated to fight the fire-giant Surtr and since he does not have his sword he will be defeated.\nEven after the loss of his weapon Freyr still has two magical artifacts, both of them dwarf-made. One is the ship Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir, which will have favoring breeze wherever its owner wants to go and can also be folded together like a napkin and carried in a pouch. The other is the boar Gullinbursti whose mane glows to illuminate the way for his owner. No myths involving Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir have come down to us but Snorri relates that Freyr rode to Baldr's funeral in a wagon pulled by Gullinbursti.\nSkaldic poetry.\nFreyr is referred to several times in skaldic poetry. In \"H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa\", partially preserved in the Prose Edda, he is said to ride a boar to Baldr's funeral.\nIn a poem by Egill Skalla-Gr\u00edmsson, Freyr is called upon along with Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to drive Eric Bloodaxe from Norway. The same skald mentions in \"Arinbjarnarkvi\u00f0a\" that his friend has been blessed by the two gods.\n\"Nafna\u00feulur\".\nIn \"Nafna\u00feulur\" Freyr is said to ride the horse Bl\u00f3\u00f0ugh\u00f3fi (\"Bloody Hoof\").\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nFreyr is mentioned in several of the poems in the \"Poetic Edda\". The information there is largely consistent with that of the \"Prose Edda\" while each collection has some details not found in the other.\n\"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\".\n\"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", the best known of the Eddic poems, describes the final confrontation between Freyr and Surtr during Ragnar\u00f6k.\nSome scholars have preferred a slightly different translation, in which the sun shines \"from the sword of the gods\". The idea is that the sword which Surtr slays Freyr with is the \"sword of the gods\" which Freyr had earlier bargained away for Ger\u00f0r. This would add a further layer of tragedy to the myth. Sigur\u00f0ur Nordal argued for this view but the possibility represented by Ursula Dronke's translation above is equally possible.\n\"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\".\n\"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", a poem which largely consists of miscellaneous information about the gods, mentions Freyr's abode.\nA tooth-gift was a gift given to an infant on the cutting of the first tooth. Since \"Alfheimr\" or \"\u00c1lfheimr\" means \"World of \u00c1lfar (Elves)\" the fact that Freyr should own it is one of the indications of a connection between the Vanir and the obscure \u00c1lfar. \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\" also mentions that the sons of \u00cdvaldi made Sk\u00ed\u00f0bla\u00f0nir for Freyr and that it is the best of ships.\n\"Lokasenna\".\nIn the poem \"Lokasenna\", Loki accuses the gods of various misdeeds. He criticizes the Vanir for incest, saying that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r had Freyr with his sister. He also states that the gods discovered Freyr and Freyja having sex together. The god T\u00fdr speaks up in Freyr's defense.\n\"Lokasenna\" also mentions that Freyr has servants called Byggvir and Beyla. They seem to have been associated with the making of bread.\n\"Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l\".\nThe courtship of Freyr and Ger\u00f0r is dealt with extensively in the poem \"Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l\".\nFreyr is depressed after seeing Ger\u00f0r. Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and Ska\u00f0i ask Sk\u00edrnir to go and talk with him. Freyr reveals the cause of his grief and asks Sk\u00edrnir to go to J\u00f6tunheimr to woo Ger\u00f0r for him. Freyr gives Sk\u00edrnir a steed and his magical sword for the journey.\nWhen Sk\u00edrnir finds Ger\u00f0r he starts by offering her treasures if she will marry Freyr. When she declines he gets her consent by threatening her with destructive magic.\n\"Ynglinga saga\".\nSnorri Sturluson starts his epic history of the kings of Norway with \"Ynglinga saga\", a euhemerized account of the Norse gods. Here Odin and the \u00c6sir are men from Asia who gain power through their prowess in war and Odin's skills. But when Odin attacks the Vanir he bites off more than he can chew and peace is negotiated after the destructive and indecisive \u00c6sir-Vanir War. Hostages are exchanged to seal the peace deal and the Vanir send Freyr and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to live with the \u00c6sir. At this point the saga, like \"Lokasenna\", mentions that incest was practised among the Vanir.\nOdin makes Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and Freyr priests of sacrifices and they become influential leaders. Odin goes on to conquer the North and settles in Sweden where he rules as king, collects taxes and maintains sacrifices. After Odin's death, Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r takes the throne. During his rule there is peace and good harvest and the Swedes come to believe that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r controls these things. Eventually Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r falls ill and dies.\nFreyr had a son named Fj\u00f6lnir, who succeeds him as king and rules during the continuing period of peace and good seasons. Fj\u00f6lnir's descendants are enumerated in \"Ynglingatal\" which describes the mythological kings of Sweden.\n\"\u00d6gmundar \u00fe\u00e1ttr dytts\".\nThe 14th century Icelandic \"\u00d6gmundar \u00fe\u00e1ttr dytts\" contains a tradition of how Freyr was transported in a wagon and administered by a priestess, in Sweden. Freyr's role as a fertility god needed a female counterpart in a divine couple (McKinnell's translation 1987):\nIn this short story, a man named Gunnar was suspected of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr's wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar if he had not promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason.\nOther Icelandic sources.\nWorship of Freyr is alluded to in several Icelanders' sagas.\nThe protagonist of \"Hrafnkels saga\" is a priest of Freyr. He dedicates a horse to the god and kills a man for riding it, setting in motion a chain of fateful events.\nIn \"G\u00edsla saga\" a chieftain named \"\u00deorgr\u00edmr Freysgo\u00f0i\" is an ardent worshipper of Freyr. When he dies he is buried in a howe.\n\"Hallfre\u00f0ar saga\", \"V\u00edga-Gl\u00fams saga\" and \"Vatnsd\u0153la saga\" also mention Freyr.\nOther Icelandic sources referring to Freyr include \"\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k\", \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\", and \"Hervarar saga\".\n\"\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k\", written 1125, is the oldest Icelandic source that mentions Freyr, including him in a genealogy of Swedish kings. \"Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k\" includes a heathen oath to be sworn at an assembly where Freyr, Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, and \"the almighty \"\u00e1ss\"\" are invoked. \"Hervarar saga\" mentions a Yuletide sacrifice of a boar to Freyr.\n\"Gesta Danorum\".\nThe 12th Century Danish \"Gesta Danorum\" describes Freyr, under the name Fr\u00f8, as the \"viceroy of the gods\".\nThat Freyr had a cult at Uppsala is well confirmed from other sources. The reference to the change in sacrificial ritual may also reflect some historical memory. There is archaeological evidence for an increase in human sacrifices in the late Viking Age though among the Norse gods human sacrifice is most often linked to Odin. Another reference to Fr\u00f8 and sacrifices is found earlier in the work, where the beginning of an annual \"bl\u00f3t\" to him is related. King Hadingus is cursed after killing a divine being and atones for his crime with a sacrifice.\nThe sacrifice of dark-coloured victims to Freyr has a parallel in Ancient Greek religion where the chthonic fertility deities preferred dark-coloured victims to white ones.\nIn book 9, Saxo identifies Fr\u00f8 as the \"king of Sweden\" (\"rex Suetiae\"):\nThe reference to public prostitution may be a memory of fertility cult practices. Such a memory may also be the source of a description in book 6 of the stay of Starcatherus, a follower of Odin, in Sweden.\nYngvi.\nA strophe of the Anglo-Saxon rune poem (c. 1100) records that:\nThis may refer to the origins of the worship of Ingui in the tribal areas that Tacitus mentions in his \"Germania\" as being populated by the Inguieonnic tribes. A later Danish chronicler lists Ingui was one of three brothers that the Danish tribes descended from. The strophe also states that \"then he (Ingui) went back over the waves, his wagon behind him\" which could connect Ingui to earlier conceptions of the wagon processions of Nerthus and the later Scandinavian conceptions of Freyr's wagon journeys.\nIngui is mentioned also in some later Anglo-Saxon literature under varying forms of his name, such as \"For what doth Ingeld have to do with Christ\" and the variants used in Beowulf to designate the kings as 'leader of the friends of Ing'. The compound Ingui-Frea (OE) and Yngvi-Freyr (ON) likely refer to the connection between the god and the Germanic kings' role as priests during the sacrifices in the pagan period, as \"Frea\" and \"Freyr\" are titles meaning 'Lord'.\nThe Swedish royal dynasty was known as the Ynglings from their descent from Yngvi-Freyr. This is supported by Tacitus, who wrote about the Germans: \"In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past they celebrate an earth-born god Tuisco, and his son Mannus, as the origin of their race, as their founders. To Mannus they assign three sons, from whose names, they say, the coast tribes are called Ingaevones; those of the interior, Herminones; all the rest, Istaevones\".\nArchaeological record.\nR\u00e4llinge statuette.\nIn 1904, a Viking Age statuette identified as a depiction of Freyr was discovered on the farm R\u00e4llinge in Lunda, S\u00f6dermanland parish in the province of S\u00f6dermanland, Sweden. The depiction features a cross-legged seated, bearded male with an erect penis. He is wearing a pointed cap or helmet and stroking his triangular beard. The statue is seven centimeters tall and is displayed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities.\nSkog tapestry.\nA part of the Swedish Skog tapestry depicts three figures that have been interpreted as allusions to Odin, Thor, and Freyr, but also as the three Scandinavian holy kings Canute, Eric and Olaf. The figures coincide with 11th century descriptions of statue arrangements recorded by Adam of Bremen at the Temple at Uppsala and written accounts of the gods during the late Viking Age. The tapestry is originally from H\u00e4lsingland, Sweden but is now housed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities.\nGullgubber.\nSmall pieces of gold foil featuring engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as \"gullgubber\") have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, at one site almost 2,500. The foil pieces have been found largely on the sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are taking part in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l\"; the coming together of Ger\u00f0r and Freyr.\nToponyms.\nNorway\nSweden\nDenmark\nNetherlands\nBelgium\nReferences.\nPrimary sources.\n "}
{"id": "11038", "revid": "308199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11038", "title": "Freyja", "text": "In Norse mythology, Freyja (; Old Norse for \"(the) Lady\") is a goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, sex, war, gold, and sei\u00f0r. Freyja is the owner of the necklace Br\u00edsingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, is accompanied by the boar Hildisv\u00edni, and possesses a cloak of falcon feathers. By her husband \u00d3\u00f0r, she is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. Along with her twin brother Freyr, her father Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, and her mother (Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. Stemming from Old Norse \"Freyja\", modern forms of the name include Freya, Freyia, and Freja.\nFreyja rules over her heavenly field, F\u00f3lkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle. The other half go to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. Within F\u00f3lkvangr lies her hall, Sessr\u00famnir. Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful j\u00f6tnar who wish to make her their wife. Freyja's husband, the god \u00d3\u00f0r, is frequently absent. She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. Freyja has numerous names, including \"Gefn\", \"H\u00f6rn\", \"Mard\u00f6ll\", \"S\u00fdr\", and \"Vanad\u00eds\".\nFreyja is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; in the \"Prose Edda\" and \"Heimskringla\", composed by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century; in several Sagas of Icelanders; in the short story \"\"S\u00f6rla \u00fe\u00e1ttr\"; in the poetry of skalds; and into the modern age in Scandinavian folklore.\nScholars have debated whether Freyja and the goddess Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the Germanic peoples; connected her to the valkyries, female battlefield choosers of the slain; and analyzed her relation to other goddesses and figures in Germanic mythology, including the thrice-burnt and thrice-reborn Gullveig/Hei\u00f0r, the goddesses Gefjon, Ska\u00f0i, \u00deorger\u00f0r H\u00f6lgabr\u00fa\u00f0r and Irpa, Mengl\u00f6\u00f0, and the 1st century CE \"Isis\" of the Suebi. In Scandinavia, Freyja's name frequently appears in the names of plants, especially in southern Sweden. Various plants in Scandinavia once bore her name, but it was replaced with the name of the Virgin Mary during the process of Christianization. Rural Scandinavians continued to acknowledge Freyja as a supernatural figure into the 19th century, and Freyja has inspired various works of art.\nName.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Freyja\" transparently means 'lady, mistress' in Old Norse. Stemming from a feminine form of Proto-Germanic *\"frawj\u014dn\" ('lord'), it is cognate with Old Saxon \"fr\u016ba\" ('lady, mistress') or Old High German \"frouwa\" ('lady'; cf. modern German \"Frau\"). \"Freyja\" is also etymologically close to the name of the god Freyr, meaning 'lord' in Old Norse. The theonym \"Freyja\" is thus considered to have been an epithet in origin, replacing a personal name that is now unattested.\nAlternative names.\nIn addition to \"Freyja\", Old Norse sources refer to the goddess by the following names:\nAttestations.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\", Freyja is mentioned or appears in the poems \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", \"Lokasenna\", \"\u00derymskvi\u00f0a\", \"Oddr\u00fanargr\u00e1tr\", and \"Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0\".\n\"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" contains a stanza that mentions Freyja, referring to her as \"\u00d3\u00f0's girl\"; Freyja being the wife of her husband, \u00d3\u00f0r. The stanza recounts that Freyja was once promised to an unnamed builder, later revealed to be a j\u00f6tunn and subsequently killed by Thor (recounted in detail in \"Gylfaginning\" chapter 42; see \"Prose Edda\" section below). In the poem \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", Odin (disguised as \"Gr\u00edmnir\") tells the young Agnar that every day Freyja allots seats to half of those that are slain in her hall F\u00f3lkvangr, while Odin owns the other half.\nIn the poem \"Lokasenna\", where Loki accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between Loki and Freyja. The introduction to the poem notes that among other gods and goddesses, Freyja attends a celebration held by \u00c6gir. In verse, after Loki has flyted with the goddess Frigg, Freyja interjects, telling Loki that he is insane for dredging up his terrible deeds, and that Frigg knows the fate of everyone, though she does not tell it. Loki tells her to be silent, and says that he knows all about her\u2014that Freyja is not lacking in blame, for each of the gods and elves in the hall have been her lover. Freyja objects. She says that Loki is lying, that he is just looking to blather about misdeeds, and since the gods and goddesses are furious at him, he can expect to go home defeated. Loki tells Freyja to be silent, calls her a malicious witch, and conjures a scenario where Freyja was once astride her brother when all of the gods, laughing, surprised the two. Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r interjects\u2014he says that a woman having a lover other than her husband is harmless, and he points out that Loki has borne children, and calls Loki a pervert. The poem continues in turn.\nThe poem \"\u00derymskvi\u00f0a\" features Loki borrowing Freyja's cloak of feathers and Thor dressing up as Freyja to fool the lusty j\u00f6tunn \u00derymr. In the poem, Thor wakes up to find that his powerful hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is missing. Thor tells Loki of his missing hammer, and the two go to the beautiful court of Freyja. Thor asks Freyja if she will lend him her cloak of feathers, so that he may try to find his hammer. Freyja agrees:\nLoki flies away in the whirring feather cloak, arriving in the land of J\u00f6tunheimr. He spies \u00derymr sitting on top of a mound. \u00derymr reveals that he has hidden Thor's hammer deep within the earth and that no one will ever know where the hammer is unless Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies back, the cloak whistling, and returns to the courts of the gods. Loki tells Thor of \u00derymr's conditions.\nThe two go to see the beautiful Freyja. The first thing that Thor says to Freyja is that she should dress herself and put on a bride's head-dress, for they shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr. At that, Freyja is furious\u2014the halls of the gods shake, she snorts in anger, and from the goddess the necklace Br\u00edsingamen falls. Indignant, Freyja responds:\nThe gods and goddesses assemble at a thing and debate how to solve the problem. The god Heimdallr proposes to dress Thor up as a bride, complete with bridal dress, head-dress, jingling keys, jewelry, and the famous Br\u00edsingamen. Thor objects but is hushed by Loki, reminding him that the new owners of the hammer will soon be settling in the land of the gods if the hammer isn't returned. Thor is dressed as planned and Loki is dressed as his maid. Thor and Loki go to J\u00f6tunheimr.\nIn the meantime, Thrym tells his servants to prepare for the arrival of the daughter of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r. When \"Freyja\" arrives in the morning, Thrym is taken aback by her behavior; her immense appetite for food and mead is far more than what he expected, and when Thrym goes in for a kiss beneath \"Freyja's\" veil, he finds \"her\" eyes to be terrifying, and he jumps down the hall. The disguised Loki makes excuses for the bride's odd behavior, claiming that she simply has not eaten or slept for eight days. In the end, the disguises successfully fool the j\u00f6tnar and, upon sight of it, Thor regains his hammer by force.\nIn the poem \"Oddr\u00fanargr\u00e1tr\", Oddr\u00fan helps Borgny give birth to twins. In thanks, Borgny invokes v\u00e6ttir, Frigg, Freyja, and other unspecified deities.\nFreyja is a main character in the poem \"Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0\", where she assists her faithful servant \u00d3ttar in finding information about his ancestry so that he may claim his inheritance. In doing so, Freyja turns \u00d3ttar into her boar, Hildisv\u00edni, and, by means of flattery and threats of death by fire, Freyja successfully pries the information that \u00d3ttar needs from the j\u00f6tunn Hyndla. Freyja speaks throughout the poem, and at one point praises \u00d3ttar for constructing a h\u00f6rgr (an altar of stones) and frequently making bl\u00f3t (sacrifices) to her:\n\"Prose Edda\".\nFreyja appears in the \"Prose Edda\" books \"Gylfaginning\" and \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\". In chapter 24 of \"Gylfaginning\", the enthroned figure of High says that after the god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r split with the goddess Ska\u00f0i, he had two beautiful and mighty children (no partner is mentioned); a son, Freyr, and a daughter, Freyja. Freyr is \"the most glorious\" of the gods, and Freyja \"the most glorious\" of the goddesses. Freyja has a dwelling in the heavens, F\u00f3lkvangr, and that whenever Freyja \"rides into battle she gets half the slain, and the other half to Odin [...]\". In support, High quotes the \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\" stanza mentioned in the \"Poetic Edda\" section above.\nHigh adds that Freyja has a large, beautiful hall called Sessr\u00famnir, and that when Freyja travels she sits in a chariot and drives two cats, and that Freyja is \"the most approachable one for people to pray to, and from her name is derived the honorific title whereby noble ladies are called \"fruvor\" [noble ladies]\". High adds that Freyja has a particular fondness for love songs, and that \"it is good to pray to her concerning love affairs\".\nIn chapter 29, High recounts the names and features of various goddesses, including Freyja. Regarding Freyja, High says that, next to Frigg, Freyja is highest in rank among them and that she owns the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Freyja is married to \u00d3\u00f0r, who goes on long travels, and the two have a very fair daughter by the name of Hnoss. While \u00d3\u00f0r is absent, Freyja stays behind and in her sorrow she weeps tears of red gold. High notes that Freyja has many names, and explains that this is because Freyja adopted them when looking for \u00d3\u00f0r and traveling \"among strange peoples\". These names include \"Gefn\", \"H\u00f6rn\", \"Mard\u00f6ll\", \"S\u00fdr\", and \"Vanad\u00eds\".\nFreyja plays a part in the events leading to the birth of Sleipnir, the eight-legged horse. In chapter 42, High recounts that, soon after the gods built the hall Valhalla, a builder (unnamed) came to them and offered to build for them in three seasons a fortification so solid that no j\u00f6tunn would be able to come in over from Midgard. In exchange, the builder wants Freyja for his bride, and the sun and the moon. After some debate the gods agree, but with added conditions. In time, just as he is about to complete his work, it is revealed that the builder is, in fact, himself a j\u00f6tunn, and he is killed by Thor. In the meantime, Loki, in the form of a mare, has been impregnated by the j\u00f6tunn's horse, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and so gives birth to Sleipnir. In support, High quotes the \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" stanza that mentions Freyja. In chapter 49, High recalls the funeral of Baldr and says that Freyja attended the funeral and there drove her cat-chariot, the final reference to the goddess in \"Gylfaginning\".\nAt the beginning of the book \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", Freyja is mentioned among eight goddesses attending a banquet held for \u00c6gir. Chapter 56 details the abduction of the goddess I\u00f0unn by the j\u00f6tunn \u00dejazi in the form of an eagle. Terrified at the prospect of death and torture due to his involvement in the abduction of I\u00f0unn, Loki asks if he may use Freyja's \"falcon shape\" to fly north to J\u00f6tunheimr and retrieve the missing goddess. Freyja allows it, and using her \"falcon shape\" and a furious chase by eagle-\u00dejazi, Loki successfully returns her.\nIn chapter 6, a means of referring to Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r is provided that refers to Frejya (\"father of Freyr and Freyja\"). In chapter 7, a means of referring to Freyr is provided that refers to the goddess (\"brother of Freyja\"). In chapter 8, ways of referring to the god Heimdallr are provided, including \"Loki's enemy, recoverer of Freyja's necklace\", inferring a myth involving Heimdallr recovering Freyja's necklace from Loki.\nIn chapter 17, the j\u00f6tunn Hrungnir finds himself in Asgard, the realm of the gods, and becomes very drunk. Hrungnir boasts that he will move Valhalla to J\u00f6tunheimr, bury Asgard, and kill all of the gods\u2014with the exception of the goddesses Freyja and Sif, who he says he will take home with him. Freyja is the only one of them that dares to bring him more to drink. Hrungnir says that he will drink all of their ale. After a while, the gods grow bored of Hrungnir's antics and invoke the name of Thor. Thor immediately enters the hall, hammer raised. Thor is furious and demands to know who is responsible for letting a j\u00f6tunn in to Asgard, who guaranteed Hrungnir safety, and why Freyja \"should be serving him drink as if at the \u00c6sir's banquet\".\nIn chapter 18, verses from the 10th century skald's composition \"\u00de\u00f3rsdr\u00e1pa\" are quoted. A kenning used in the poem refers to Freyja. In chapter 20, poetic ways to refer to Freyja are provided; \"daughter of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r\", \"sister of Freyr\", \"wife of \u00d3\u00f0r\", \"mother of Hnoss\", \"possessor of the fallen slain and of Sessrumnir and tom-cats\", possessor of Br\u00edsingamen, \"Van-deity\", Vanad\u00eds, and \"fair-tear deity\". In chapter 32, poetic ways to refer to gold are provided, including \"Freyja's weeping\" and \"rain or shower [...] from Freyja's eyes\".\nChapter 33 tells that once the gods journeyed to visit \u00c6gir, one of whom was Freyja. In chapter 49, a quote from a work by the skald Einarr Sk\u00falason employs the kenning \"\u00d3\u00f0r's bedfellow's eye-rain\", which refers to Freyja and means \"gold\".\nChapter 36 explains again that gold can be referring to as Freyja's weeping due to her red gold tears. In support, works by the skalds Sk\u00fali \u00de\u00f3rsteinsson and Einarr Sk\u00falason are cited that use \"Freyja's tears\" or \"Freyja's weepings\" to represent \"gold\". The chapter features additional quotes from poetry by Einarr Sk\u00falason that references the goddess and her child Hnoss. Freyja receives a final mention in the \"Prose Edda\" in chapter 75, where a list of goddesses is provided that includes Freyja.\n\"Heimskringla\".\nThe \"Heimskringla\" book \"Ynglinga saga\" provides a euhemerized account of the origin of the gods, including Freyja. In chapter 4, Freyja is introduced as a member of the Vanir, the sister of Freyr, and the daughter of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and his sister (whose name is not provided). After the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War ends in a stalemate, Odin appoints Freyr and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as priests over sacrifices. Freyja becomes the priestess of sacrificial offerings and it was she who introduced the practice of sei\u00f0r to the \u00c6sir, previously only practiced by the Vanir.\nIn chapter 10, Freyja's brother Freyr dies, and Freyja is the last survivor among the \u00c6sir and Vanir. Freyja keeps up the sacrifices and becomes famous. The saga explains that, due to Freyja's fame, all women of rank become known by her name\u2014\"fr\u00favor\" (\"ladies\"), a woman who is the mistress of her property is referred to as \"freyja\", and \"h\u00fasfreyja\" (\"lady of the house\") for a woman who owns an estate.\nThe chapter adds that not only was Freyja very clever, but that she and her husband \u00d3\u00f0r had two immensely beautiful daughters, Gersemi and Hnoss, \"who gave their names to our most precious possessions\".\nOther.\nFreyja is mentioned in the sagas \"Egils saga\", \"Nj\u00e1ls saga\", \"H\u00e1lfs saga ok H\u00e1lfsrekka\", and in \"S\u00f6rla \u00fe\u00e1ttr\".\nIn \"Egils saga\", when Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson refuses to eat, his daughter \u00deorger\u00f0r (here anglicized as \"Thorgerd\") says she will go without food and thus starve to death, and in doing so will meet the goddess Freyja:\nIn the first chapter of the 14th century legendary saga \"H\u00e1lfs saga ok H\u00e1lfsrekka\", King Alrek has two wives, Geirhild and Signy, and cannot keep them both. He tells the two women that he would keep whichever of them that brews the better ale for him by the time he has returned home in the summer. The two compete and during the brewing process Signy prays to Freyja and Geirhild to H\u00f6tt (\"hood\"), a man she had met earlier (earlier in the saga revealed to be Odin in disguise). H\u00f6tt answers her prayer and spits on her yeast. Signy's brew wins the contest.\nIn \"S\u00f6rla \u00fe\u00e1ttr\", a short, late 14th century narrative from a later and extended version of the \"\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar\" found in the \"Flateyjarb\u00f3k\" manuscript, a euhemerized account of the gods is provided. In the account, Freyja is described as having been a concubine of Odin, who bartered sex to four dwarfs for a golden necklace. In the work, the \u00c6sir once lived in a city called Asgard, located in a region called \"Asialand or Asiahome\". Odin was the king of the realm, and made Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and Freyr temple priests. Freyja was the daughter of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, and was Odin's concubine. Odin deeply loved Freyja, and she was \"the fairest of woman of that day\". Freyja had a beautiful bower, and when the door was shut no one could enter without Freyja's permission.\nChapter 1 records that one day Freyja passed by an open stone where dwarfs lived. Four dwarfs were smithying a golden necklace, and it was nearly done. Looking at the necklace, the dwarfs thought Freyja to be most fair, and she the necklace. Freyja offered to buy the collar from them with silver and gold and other items of value. The dwarfs said that they had no lack of money, and that for the necklace the only thing she could offer them would be a night with each of them. \"Whether she liked it better or worse\", Freyja agreed to the conditions, and so spent a night with each of the four dwarfs. The conditions were fulfilled and the necklace was hers. Freyja went home to her bower as if nothing happened.\nAs related in chapter 2, Loki, under the service of Odin, found out about Freyja's actions and told Odin. Odin told Loki to get the necklace and bring it to him. Loki said that since no one could enter Freyja's bower against her will, this wouldn't be an easy task, yet Odin told him not to come back until he had found a way to get the necklace. Howling, Loki turned away and went to Freyja's bower but found it locked, and that he couldn't enter. So Loki transformed himself into a fly, and after having trouble finding even the tiniest of entrances, he managed to find a tiny hole at the gable-top, yet even here he had to squeeze through to enter.\nHaving made his way into Freyja's chambers, Loki looked around to be sure that no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and noticed that she was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a flea and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there bit her. Freyja stirred, turning about, and then fell asleep again. Loki removed his flea's shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and returned to Odin.\nThe next morning Freyja woke and saw that the doors to her bower were open, yet unbroken, and that her precious necklace was gone. Freyja had an idea of who was responsible. She got dressed and went to Odin. She told Odin of the malice he had allowed against her and of the theft of her necklace, and that he should give her back her jewelry.\nOdin said that, given how she obtained it, she would never get it back. That is, with one exception: she could have it back if she could make two kings, themselves ruling twenty kings each, battle one another, and cast a spell so that each time one of their numbers falls in battle, they will again spring up and fight again. And that this must go on eternally, unless a Christian man of a particular stature goes into the battle and smites them, only then will they stay dead. Freyja agreed.\nPost-Christianization and Scandinavian folklore.\nAlthough the Christianization of Scandinavia sought to demonize the native gods, belief and reverence in the gods, including Freyja, remained into the modern period and melded into Scandinavian folklore. comments that Freyja became a particular target under Christianization:\nHowever, Freyja did not disappear. In Iceland, Freyja was called upon for assistance by way of Icelandic magical staves as late as the 18th century; and as late as the 19th century, Freyja is recorded as retaining elements of her role as a fertility goddess among rural Swedes.\nThe Old Norse poem \"\u00derymskvi\u00f0a\" (or its source) continued into Scandinavian folk song tradition, where it was euhemerized and otherwise transformed over time. In Iceland, the poem became known as \"\u00derylur\", whereas in Denmark the poem became \"Thor af Havsgaard\" and in Sweden it became \"Torvisan\" or \"Hammarh\u00e4mtningen\". A section of the Swedish \"Torvisan\", in which \"Freyja\" has been transformed into \"the fair\" (\"den v\u00e4na\") \"Frojenborg\", reads as follows:\nIn the province of Sm\u00e5land, Sweden, an account is recorded connecting Freyja with sheet lightning in this respect. Writer Johan Alfred G\u00f6th recalled a Sunday in 1880 where men were walking in fields and looking at nearly ripened rye, where M\u00e5ns in Karryd said: \"Now Freyja is out watching if the rye is ripe\". Along with this, G\u00f6th recalls another mention of Freyja in the countryside:\nIn V\u00e4rend, Sweden, Freyja could also arrive at Christmas night and she used to shake the apple trees for the sake of a good harvest and consequently people left some apples in the trees for her sake. However, it was dangerous to leave the plough outdoors, because if Freyja sat on it, it would no longer be of any use.\nEponyms.\nSeveral plants were named after Freyja, such as \"Freyja's tears\" and \"Freyja's hair\" (\"Polygala vulgaris\"), but during the process of Christianization, the name of the goddess was replaced with that of the Virgin Mary. In the pre-Christian period, the Orion constellation was called either Frigg's distaff or Freyja's distaff (Swedish \"Frejerock\").\nPlace names in Norway and Sweden reflect devotion to the goddess, including the Norwegian place name Fr\u00f8ihov (originally *\"Freyjuhof\", literally \"Freyja's hof\") and Swedish place names such as Fr\u00f6vi (from *\"Freyjuv\u00e9\", literally \"Freyja's v\u00e9\"). In a survey of toponyms in Norway, M. Olsen tallies at least 20 to 30 location names compounded with \"Freyja\". Three of these place names appear to derive from *\"Freyjuhof\" ('Freyja's hof'), whereas the goddess's name is frequently otherwise compounded with words for 'meadow' (such as \"-\u00feveit\", -\"land\") and similar land formations. These toponyms are attested most commonly on the west coast though a high frequency is found in the southeast.\nPlace names containing \"Freyja\" are yet more numerous and varied in Sweden, where they are widely distributed. A particular concentration is recorded in Uppland, among which a number derive from the above-mentioned \"*Freyjuv\u00e9\" and also *\"Freyjulundr\" ('Freyja's sacred grove'), place names that indicate public worship of Freyja. In addition, a variety of place names (such as \"Fr\u00f8al\" and \"Fr\u00f6ale\") have been seen as containing an element cognate to Gothic \"alhs\" and Old English \"ealh\" (\"temple\"), although these place names may be otherwise interpreted. In addition, \"Frejya\" appears as a compound element with a variety of words for geographic features such as fields, meadows, lakes, and natural objects such as rocks.\nThe Freyja name \"H\u00f6rn\" appears in the Swedish place names H\u00e4rnevi and J\u00e4rnevi, stemming from the reconstructed Old Norse place name \"*H\u00f6rnar-v\u00e9\" (meaning \"H\u00f6rn's v\u00e9\").\nArchaeological record and historic depictions.\nA priestess was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyh\u00f6ga in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland. In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant, which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as Freyja's necklace Br\u00edsingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself.\nA 7th-century phalara found in a \"warrior grave\" in what is now Eschwege in northwestern Germany features a female figure with two large braids flanked by two \"cat-like\" beings and holding a staff-like object. This figure has been interpreted as Freyja. This image may be connected to various B-type bracteates, referred to as the F\u00fcrstenberg-type, that may also depict the goddess; they \"show a female figure, in a short skirt and double-looped hair, holding a stave or sceptre in her right hand and a double-cross feature in the left\".\nA 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the Schleswig Cathedral in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a distaff. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.\nTheories.\nRelation to Frigg and other goddesses and figures.\nDue to numerous similarities, scholars have frequently connected Freyja with the goddess Frigg. The connection with Frigg and question of possible earlier identification of Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period (Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis) remains a matter of scholarly discourse. Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments, \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"\nLike the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir, the name \"Freyja\" is not attested outside of Scandinavia, as opposed to the name of the goddess \"Frigg\", who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *\"Frijj\u014d\". Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which \"Freyja\" descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to lack of evidence.\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", a figure by the name of Gullveig is burnt three times yet is three times reborn. After her third rebirth, she is known as Hei\u00f0r. This event is generally accepted as precipitating the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War. Starting with scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre, scholars such as Rudolf Simek, Andy Orchard, and John Lindow have theorized that Gullveig/Hei\u00f0r is the same figure as Freyja, and that her involvement with the \u00c6sir somehow led to the events of the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War.\nOutside of theories connecting Freyja with the goddess Frigg, some scholars, such as Hilda Ellis Davidson and , have theorized that other goddesses in Norse mythology, such as Gefjon, Ger\u00f0r, and Ska\u00f0i, may be forms of Freyja in different roles or ages.\nReceiver of the slain.\nFreyja and her afterlife field F\u00f3lkvangr, where she receives half of the slain, have been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Scholar Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m points out the description in \"Gylfaginning\" where it is said of Freyja that \"whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain\", and interprets \"F\u00f3lkvangr\" as \"the field of the Warriors\". N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is Sessrumnir (which she translates as \"filled with many seats\"), a dwelling that N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m comments that \"still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to \u00d3\u00f0inn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.\"\nSiegfried Andres Dobat comments that \"in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm F\u00f3lkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar and the d\u00edsir.\"\nThe Oriental hypothesis.\nGustav Neckel, writing in 1920, connects Freyja to the Phrygian goddess Cybele. According to Neckel, both goddesses can be interpreted as \"fertility goddesses\" and other potential resemblances have been noted. Some scholars have suggested that the image of Cybele subsequently influenced the iconography of Freyja, the lions drawing the former's chariot becoming large cats. These observations became an extremely common observation in works regarding Old Norse religion until at least the early 1990s. In her book-length study of scholarship on the topic of Freyja, Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m (1995) is highly critical of this deduction; N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m says that \"these 'parallels' are due to sheer ignorance about the characteristics of Cybele; scholars have not troubled to look into the resemblances and differences between the two goddesses, if any, in support for their arguments for a common origin.\"\nModern influence.\nInto the modern period, Freyja was treated as a Scandinavian counterpart to the Roman Venus in, for example, Swedish literature, where the goddess may be associated with romantic love or, conversely, simply as a synonym for \"lust and potency\". In the 18th century, Swedish poet Carl Michael Bellman referred to Stockholm prostitutes in his \"Fredman's Epistles\" as \"the children of Fr\u00f6ja\". In the 19th century, Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m observes, Swedish Romanticism focused less on Freyja's erotic qualities and more on the image of \"the pining goddess, weeping for her husband\".\nFreyja is mentioned in the first stanza (\"it is called old Denmark and it is Freja's hall\") of the civil national anthem of Denmark, \"Der er et yndigt land\", written by 19th century Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger in 1819. In addition, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger wrote a comedy entitled \"Freyjas alter\" (1818) and a poem \"Freais sal\" featuring the goddess.\nThe 19th century German composer Richard Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" opera cycle features \"Freia\", the goddess Freyja combined with the apple-bearing goddess I\u00f0unn.\nIn late 19th century and early 20th century Northern Europe, Freyja was the subject of numerous works of art, including \"Freyja\" by H. E. Freund (statue, 1821\u20131822), \"Freja s\u00f6kande sin make\" (painting, 1852) by Nils Blomm\u00e9r, \"Freyjas Aufnahme uner den G\u00f6ttern\" (charcoal drawing, 1881), and \"Frigg; Freyja\" (drawing, 1883) by , \"Freyja\" (1901) by Carl Emil Doepler d. J., and \"Freyja and the Brisingamen\" by J. Doyle Penrose (painting, 1862\u20131932). Like other Norse goddesses, her name was applied widely in Scandinavia to, for example, \"sweetmeats or to stout carthorses\". \"Vanad\u00eds\", one of Freyja's names, is the source of the name of the chemical element vanadium, so named because of its many colored compounds.\nStarting in the early 1990s, derivatives of \"Freyja\" began to appear as a given name for girls. According to the Norwegian name database from the Central Statistics Bureau, around 500 women are listed with the first name \"Fr\u00f8ya\" (the modern Norwegian spelling of the goddess's name) in the country. There are also several similar names, such as the first element of the dithematic personal name \"Fr\u00f8ydis\"."}
{"id": "11040", "revid": "3617940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11040", "title": "First-class cricket", "text": "First-class cricket is an official classification of the highest-standard international or domestic matches in the sport of cricket. A first-class match is of three or more days' scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each and is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams. Matches must allow for the teams to play two innings each although, in practice, a team might play only one innings or none at all.\nFirst-class cricket (which for this purpose includes all \"important matches\" played before 1895), along with historical single-wicket and the modern limited-overs forms of List A and Twenty20, is one of the highest-standard forms of cricket. The origin of the term \"first-class cricket\" is unknown but it was used loosely before it acquired an official status, effective in 1895, following a meeting of leading English clubs in May 1894. Subsequently, at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) in May 1947, it was formally defined on a global basis. A significant omission of the ICC ruling was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively. This has left historians, and especially statisticians, with the problem of how to categorise earlier matches, especially those played before 1895 in Great Britain. The solution put forward by the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) is to classify all pre-1895 matches of a high standard as important matches.\nTest cricket, the highest standard of cricket, is statistically a form of first-class cricket, though the term \"first-class\" is mainly used to refer to domestic competition. A player's first-class statistics include any performances in Test matches.\nMCC ruling, May 1894.\nBefore 1894 \"first-class cricket\" was a common term used loosely to suggest that a match had a high standard; adjectives like \"great\", \"important\" and \"major\" were also loosely applied to such matches. There was at the time no concept of what became Test cricket and so an international match would be called a first-class one, as would any match involving two senior county clubs. At the beginning of the 1890s, there were only four formally constituted county clubs: Sussex is the oldest, formed in 1839, and it had been followed by Kent, Nottinghamshire and Surrey. In the early 1860s, several more clubs were founded and questions began to be raised in the sporting press about which should be categorised as first-class, but there was considerable disagreement in the answers. In 1880, the Cricket Reporting Agency was founded. It acquired influence through the decade especially by association with \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" (\"Wisden\") and the press came to generally rely on its information and opinions.\nThe term acquired official status, though limited to matches in Great Britain, following a meeting at Lord's in May 1894 between the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) committee and the secretaries of the clubs involved in the official County Championship, which had begun in 1890. As a result, those clubs became first-class from 1895 along with MCC, Cambridge University, Oxford University, senior cricket touring teams (i.e., Australia and South Africa at that time) and other teams designated as such by MCC (e.g. North v South, Gentlemen v Players and occasional \"elevens\" which consisted of recognised first-class players). Officially, therefore, the inaugural first-class match was the opening game of the 1895 season between MCC and Nottinghamshire at Lord's on 1 and 2 May, MCC winning by 37 runs.\nICC ruling, May 1947.\nThe term \"first-class cricket\" was formally defined by the then Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) on 19 May 1947. It was made clear that the definition \"will not have retrospective effect\". The definition is as follows:\nA match of three or more days' duration between two sides of eleven players officially adjudged first-class, shall be regarded as a first-class fixture. Matches in which either team have more than eleven players or which are scheduled for less than three days shall not be regarded as first-class. The Governing body in each country shall decide the status of teams.\nFor example, MCC was authorised to determine the status of matches played in Great Britain. For all intents and purposes, the 1947 ICC definition confirmed the 1894 MCC definition and gave it international recognition and usage.\nHence, official judgment of status is the responsibility of the governing body in each country that is a \"full member\" of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The governing body grants first-class status to international teams and to domestic teams that are representative of the country's highest playing standard. Later ICC rulings make it possible for international teams from \"associate members\" of the ICC to achieve first-class status but it is dependent on the status of their opponents in a given match.\nApplication.\nAccording to the ICC definition, a match may be adjudged first-class if:\nA Test match is a first-class match played between two ICC full member countries subject to their current status at the ICC and the application of ICC conditions when the match is played.\nRecognised matches.\nIn 2010, the ICC published its \"Classification of Official Cricket\" which includes the criteria with which a match must comply to achieve a desired categorisation. In the section on first-class cricket, there is a list of the types of match that \"should\" qualify. It is important to note, given the differences in opinion about what constitutes a first-class match, that the ICC clearly stipulates that its match type list \"is not exhaustive and is merely indicative of the matches which would fall into the first-class definition\". For example, the list includes matches of recognised first-class teams \"versus\" international touring teams; and the leading domestic championships (using their then-current names) such as the County Championship, Sheffield Shield, Ranji Trophy, etc. In February 2020, during the 2019\u201320 Ranji Trophy, the 60,000th first-class cricket match was played.\nNo retrospective effect.\nThe absence of any ICC ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) is problematic for those cricket statisticians who wish to categorise earlier matches in the same way. They have responded by compiling their own match lists and allocating a strictly \"unofficial\" first-class status to the matches they consider to have been of a high standard. It is therefore a matter of opinion only with no official support. Inevitable differences have arisen and there are variations in published cricket statistics.\nIssue for statisticians.\nA key issue for the statisticians is when first-class cricket for their purpose is deemed to have begun. Writing in 1951, Roy Webber argued that the majority of matches prior to 1864 (i.e., the year in which overarm bowling was legalised) \"cannot be regarded as first-class\" and their records are used \"for their historical associations\". This drew a line between what was important historically and what should form part of the statistical record. Hence, for pre-1895 (i.e., in Great Britain) cricket matches, \"first-class\" is essentially a statistical concept while the historical concept is broader and takes account of historical significance. Webber's rationale was that cricket was \"generally weak before 1864\" (there was a greater and increasingly more organised effort to promote county cricket from about that time) and match details were largely incomplete, especially bowling analyses, which hindered compilation of records. According to Webber's view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1864 season between Cambridge University and MCC at Fenner's on 12 and 13 May, Cambridge winning by 6 wickets.\nImportant matches classification.\nWhen the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) published its \"Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles\" in 1982, it tentatively agreed with Webber's 1864 start date by saying that \"the line between first-class and other matches becomes more easily discernible about that date\". A year earlier, the ACS had published its \"Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 \u2013 1863\" in which it listed all the known matches during that period which it considered to have historical importance. The ACS did stipulate that they had taken a more lenient view of importance regarding matches played in the 18th century than they did of matches played in the 19th century. As they explained, surviving details of 18th century matches are typically incomplete while there is a fairly comprehensive store of data about 19th century matches, certainly since 1825.\n18th century startpoints.\nSubsequently, Webber's view has been challenged by those who suggest earlier dates for the commencement of \"first-class statistics\". Bill Frindall believed that 1815 should be the start to encompass the entire roundarm bowling phase of cricket's history. However, roundarm did not begin in earnest until 1827. In Frindall's view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1815 season between MCC and Middlesex at Lord's on 31 May and 1 June, Middlesex winning by 16 runs. The most significant internet-based views are those of \"CricketArchive\" (CA) and \"ESPNcricinfo\" (CI), both of which hold that the earliest first-class match was Hampshire \"versus\" All-England at Broadhalfpenny Down on 24 and 25 June 1772. CA has numbered this match \"f1\" (i.e., first-class match number one) and CI as \"First-Class # 1\".\nHistorical v. statistical.\nHowever commendable these views may be, they are not only unofficial but also entirely statistical. The 1772 match left a scorecard that is complete apart from the bowling analyses and so the data is sufficient for a statistical study, especially as the scorecard was itself the start of a trend and there are surviving scorecards from every season commencing 1772. The historical view centres on the historical significance of a match and its known contemporary importance measured by, as is often the case with early matches, the amount of money at stake. Other factors are the size of the crowd, if known, and the fact that a match was deemed notable enough to be reported in the press. The earliest match known to have been accorded superior status in a contemporary report (i.e., \"a great match\" in this case) and to have been played for a large sum of money was one in Sussex between two unnamed eleven-a-side teams contesting \"fifty guineas apiece\" in June 1697, a match of enormous historical significance but with no statistical data recorded."}

His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both linguistics and semiotics in the 20th century. He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguistics and one of two major founders (together with Charles Sanders Peirce) of semiotics, or \"semiology\", as Saussure called it.\nOne of his translators, Roy Harris, summarized Saussure's contribution to linguistics and the study of \"the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology and anthropology.\" Although they have undergone extension and critique over time, the dimensions of organization introduced by Saussure continue to inform contemporary approaches to the phenomenon of language. Prague school linguist Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd writes that Saussure's \"discovery of the internal structure of the linguistic sign differentiated the sign both from mere acoustic 'things'... and from mental processes\", and that in this development \"new roads were thereby opened not only for linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of literature\". Ruqaiya Hasan argued that \"the impact of Saussure\u2019s theory of the linguistic sign has been such that modern linguists and their theories have since been positioned by reference to him: they are known as pre-Saussurean, Saussurean, anti-Saussurean, post-Saussurean, or non-Saussure\".\nBiography.\nSaussure was born in Geneva in 1857. His father was Henri Louis Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Saussure, a mineralogist, entomologist, and taxonomist. Saussure showed signs of considerable talent and intellectual ability as early as the age of fourteen. In the autumn of 1870, he began attending the Institution Martine (previously the Institution Lecoultre until 1969), in Geneva. There he lived with the family of a classmate, Elie David. Graduating at the top of class, Saussure expected to continue his studies at the Gymnase de Gen\u00e8ve, but his father decided he was not mature enough at fourteen and a half, and sent him to the Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve instead. Saussure was not pleased, as he complained: \"I entered the Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve, to waste a year there as completely as a year can be wasted.\"\nAfter a year of studying Latin, Ancient Greek and Sanskrit and taking a variety of courses at the University of Geneva, he commenced graduate work at the University of Leipzig in 1876.\nTwo years later, at 21, Saussure published a book entitled \"M\u00e9moire sur le syst\u00e8me primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-europ\u00e9ennes\" (\"Dissertation on the Primitive Vowel System in Indo-European Languages\"). After this he studied for a year at the University of Berlin under the \"Privatdozent\" Heinrich Zimmer, with whom he studied Celtic, and Hermann Oldenberg with whom he continued his studies of Sanskrit. He returned to Leipzig to defend his doctoral dissertation \"De l'emploi du g\u00e9nitif absolu en Sanscrit\", and was awarded his doctorate in February 1880. Soon, he relocated to the University of Paris, where he lectured on Sanskrit, Gothic and Old High German and occasionally other subjects.\nFerdinand de Saussure is one of the world's most quoted linguists, which is remarkable as he himself hardly published anything during his lifetime. Even his few scientific articles are not unproblematic. Thus, for example, his publication on Lithuanian phonetics is \"grosso modo\" taken from studies by the Lithuanian researcher Friedrich Kurschat, with whom Saussure traveled through Lithuania in August 1880 for two weeks, and whose (German) books Saussure had read. Saussure, who had studied some basic grammar of Lithuanian in Leipzig for one semester but was unable to speak the language, was thus dependent on Kurschat.\nSaussure taught at the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes for eleven years during which he was named Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honor). When offered a professorship in Geneva in 1892, he returned to Switzerland. Saussure lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European at the University of Geneva for the remainder of his life. It was not until 1907 that Saussure began teaching the Course of General Linguistics, which he would offer three times, ending in the summer of 1911. He died in 1913 in Vufflens-le-Ch\u00e2teau, Vaud, Switzerland. His brothers were the linguist and Esperantist Ren\u00e9 de Saussure, and scholar of ancient Chinese astronomy, L\u00e9opold de Saussure. In turn, his son was the psychoanalyst Raymond de Saussure.\nSaussure attempted, at various times in the 1880s and 1890s, to write a book on general linguistic matters. His lectures about important principles of language description in Geneva between 1907 and 1911 were collected and published by his pupils posthumously in the famous \"Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\" in 1916. Some of his manuscripts, including an unfinished essay discovered in 1996, were published in \"Writings in General Linguistics\", but most of the material in it had already been published in Engler's critical edition of the \"Course\", in 1967 and 1974. (TUFA) It is also questionable to what extent the \"Cours\" itself can be traced back to Saussure alone. Studies have shown that at least the current version and its content are more likely to have the so-called editors Charles Bally and Albert S\u00e8chehaye as their source than Saussure himself.\nWork and influence.\nSaussure's theoretical reconstructions of the Proto-Indo-European language vocalic system and particularly his theory of laryngeals, otherwise unattested at the time, bore fruit and found confirmation after the decipherment of Hittite in the work of later generations of linguists such as \u00c9mile Benveniste and Walter Couvreur, who both drew direct inspiration from their reading of the 1878 \"M\u00e9moire\".\nSaussure had a major impact on the development of linguistic theory in the first half of the 20th century with his notions becoming incorporated in the central tenets of structural linguistics. His main contribution to structuralism was his theory of a two-tiered reality about language. The first is the \"langue\", the abstract and invisible layer, while the second, the \"parole\", refers to the actual speech that we hear in real life. This framework was later adopted by Claude Levi-Strauss, who used the two-tiered model to determine the reality of myths. His idea was that all myths have an underlying pattern, which form the structure that makes them myths. These established the structuralist framework to literary criticism.\nIn Europe, the most important work after Saussure's death was done by the Prague school. Most notably, Nikolay Trubetzkoy and Roman Jakobson headed the efforts of the Prague School in setting the course of phonological theory in the decades from 1940. Jakobson's universalizing structural-functional theory of phonology, based on a markedness hierarchy of distinctive features, was the first successful solution of a plane of linguistic analysis according to the Saussurean hypotheses. Elsewhere, Louis Hjelmslev and the Copenhagen School proposed new interpretations of linguistics from structuralist theoretical frameworks.\nIn America, where the term 'structuralism' became highly ambiguous, Saussure's ideas informed the distributionalism of Leonard Bloomfield, but his influence remained limited. Systemic functional linguistics is a theory considered to be based firmly on the Saussurean principles of the sign, albeit with some modifications. Ruqaiya Hasan describes systemic functional linguistics as a 'post-Saussurean' linguistic theory. Michael Halliday argues:\n\"Course in General Linguistics\".\nSaussure's most influential work, \"Course in General Linguistics\" (\"Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\"), was published posthumously in 1916 by former students Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye, on the basis of notes taken from Saussure's lectures in Geneva. The \"Course\" became one of the seminal linguistics works of the 20th century not primarily for the content (many of the ideas had been anticipated in the works of other 20th century linguists) but for the innovative approach that Saussure applied in discussing linguistic phenomena.\nIts central notion is that language may be analyzed as a formal system of differential elements, apart from the messy dialectics of real-time production and comprehension. Examples of these elements include his notion of the linguistic sign, which is composed of the signifier and the signified. Though the sign may also have a referent, Saussure took that to lie beyond the linguist's purview.\nThroughout the book, he stated that a linguist can develop a diachronic analysis of a text or theory of language but must learn just as much or more about the language/text as it exists at any moment in time (i.e. \"synchronically\"): \"Language is a system of signs that expresses ideas\". A science that studies the life of signs within society and is a part of social and general psychology. Saussure believed that semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign, and he called it semiology.\nLaryngeal theory.\nWhile a student, Saussure published an important work in Indo-European philology that proposed the existence of ghosts in Proto-Indo-European called \"sonant coefficients\". The Scandinavian scholar Hermann M\u00f6ller suggested that they might actually be laryngeal consonants, leading to what is now known as the laryngeal theory. It has been argued that the problem that Saussure encountered, trying to explain how he was able to make systematic and predictive hypotheses from known linguistic data to unknown linguistic data, stimulated his development of structuralism. His predictions about the existence of primate coefficients/laryngeals and their evolution proved a success when Hittite texts were discovered and deciphered, some 50 years later.\nInfluence outside linguistics.\nThe principles and methods employed by structuralism were later adapted in diverse fields by French intellectuals such as Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, and Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss. Such scholars took influence from Saussure's ideas in their own areas of study (literary studies/philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropology, respectively).\nView of language.\nSaussure approaches theory of language from two different perspectives. On the one hand, language is a system of signs. That is, a semiotic system; or a semiological system as he himself calls it. On the other hand, a language is also a social phenomenon: a product of the language community.\nLanguage as semiology.\nThe bilateral sign.\nOne of Saussure's key contributions to semiotics lies in what he called \"semiology\", the concept of the bilateral (two-sided) sign which consists of 'the signifier' (a linguistic form, e.g. a word) and 'the signified' (the meaning of the form). Saussure supported the argument for the arbitrariness of the sign although he did not deny the fact that some words are onomatopoeic, or claim that picture-like symbols are fully arbitrary. Saussure also did not consider the linguistic sign as random, but as historically cemented. All in all, he did not invent the philosophy of arbitrariness, but made a very influential contribution to it.\nThe arbitrariness of words of different languages itself is a fundamental concept in Western thinking of language, dating back to Ancient Greek philosophers. The question whether words are natural or arbitrary (and artificially made by people) returned as a controversial topic during the Age of Enlightenment when the mediaeval scholastic dogma, that languages were created by God, became opposed by the advocates of humanistic philosophy. There were efforts to construct a 'universal language', based on the lost Adamic language, with various attempts to uncover universal words or characters which would be readily understood by all people regardless of their nationality. John Locke, on the other hand, was among those who believed that languages were a rational human innovation, and argued for the arbitrariness of words.\nSaussure took it for granted in his time that \"No one disputes the principle of the arbitrary nature of the sign.\" He however disagreed with the common notion that each word corresponds \"to the thing that it names\" or what is called the referent in modern semiotics. For example, In Saussure's notion, the word 'tree' does not refer to a tree as a physical object, but to the psychological \"concept\" of a tree. The linguistic sign thus arises from the psychological \"association\" between the signifier (a 'sound-image') and the signified (a 'concept'). There can therefore be no linguistic expression without meaning, but also no meaning without linguistic expression. Saussure's structuralism, as it later became called, therefore includes an implication of linguistic relativity.\nThe naming of spectral colours exemplifies how meaning and expression arise simultaneously from their interlinkage. Different colour frequencies are per se meaningless, or mere \"substance\" or meaning potential. Likewise, phonemic combinations which are not associated with any content are only meaningless expression potential, and therefore not considered as \"signs\". It is only when a region of the spectrum is outlined and given an arbitrary name, for example 'blue', that the sign emerges. The sign consists of the \"signifier\" ('blue') and of the \"signified\" (the colour region), and of the associative link which connects them. Arising from an arbitrary demarcation of meaning potential, the signified is not a property of the physical world. In Saussure's concept, language is ultimately not a function of reality, but a self-contained system. Thus, Saussure's semiology entails a bilateral (two-sided) perspective of semiotics. \nThe same idea is applied to any concept. For example, natural law does not dictate which plants are 'trees' and which are 'shrubs' or a different type of woody plant; or whether these should be divided into further groups. Like blue, all signs gain semantic \"value\" in opposition to other signs of the system (e.g. red, colourless). If more signs emerge (e.g. 'marine blue), the semantic field of the original word may narrow down. Conversely, words may become antiquated, whereby competition for the semantic field lessens. Or, the meaning of a word may change altogether.\nAfter his death, structural and functional linguists applied Saussure's concept to the analysis of the linguistic form as motivated by meaning. The opposite direction of the linguistic expressions as giving rise to the conceptual system, on the other hand, became the foundation of the post-Second World War structuralists who adopted Saussure's concept of structural linguistics as the model for all human sciences as the study of how language shapes our concepts of the world. Thus, Saussure's model became important not only for linguistics, but for humanities and social sciences as a whole.\nOpposition theory.\nA second key contribution comes from Saussure's notion of the organisation of language based on the principle opposition. Saussure made a distinction between meaning (significance) and \"value\". On the semantic side, concepts gain value by being contrasted with related concepts, creating a conceptual system which could in modern terms be described as a semantic network. On the level of the sound-image, phonemes and morphemes gain value by being contrasted with related phonemes and morphemes; and on the level of the grammar, parts of speech gain value by being contrasted with each other. Each element within each system is eventually contrasted with all other elements in different types of relations so that not two elements have the exact same value:\nSaussure defined his own theory in terms of binary oppositions: \"sign\u2014signified, meaning\u2014value, language\u2014speech, synchronic\u2014diachronic, internal linguistics\u2014external linguistics\", and so on. The related term markedness denotes the assessment of value between binary oppositions. These were studied extensively by post-war structuralists such as Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss to explain the organisation of social conceptualisation, and later by the post-structuralists to criticise it.\nBased on markedness theory, the Prague Linguistic Circle made great advances in the study of phonetics reforming it as the systemic study of phonology. Although the terms opposition and markedness are rightly associated with Saussure's concept of language as a semiological system, he did not invent the terms and concepts which had been discussed by various 19th century grammarians before him.\nLanguage as a social phenomenon.\nIn his treatment of language as a 'social fact', Saussure touches topics that were controversial in his time, and that would continue to split opinions in the post-war structuralist movement. Saussure's relationship with 19th century theories of language was somewhat ambivalent. These included social Darwinism and V\u00f6lkerpsychologie or Volksgeist thinking which were regarded by many intellectuals as nationalist and racist pseudoscience.\nSaussure, however, considered the ideas useful if treated in a proper way. Instead of discarding August Schleicher's organicism or Heymann Steinthal's \"spirit of the nation\", he restricted their sphere in ways that were meant to preclude any chauvinistic interpretations.\nOrganic analogy\nSaussure exploited the sociobiological concept of language as a living organism. He criticises August Schleicher and Max M\u00fcller's ideas of languages as organisms struggling for living space, but settles with promoting the idea of linguistics as a natural science as long as the study of the 'organism' of language excludes its adaptation to its territory. This concept would be modified in post-Saussurean linguistics by the Prague circle linguists Roman Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy, and eventually diminished.\nThe speech circuit.\nPerhaps the most famous of Saussure's ideas is the distinction between language and speech (Fr. \"langue et parole\"), with 'speech' referring to the individual occurrences of language usage. These constitute two parts of three of Saussure's 'speech circuit' (\"circuit de parole\"). The third part is the brain, that is, the mind of the individual member of the language community. This idea is in principle borrowed from Steinthal, so Saussure concept of a language as a social fact corresponds to \"Volksgeist\", although he was careful to preclude any nationalistic interpretations. In Saussure's and Durkheim's thinking, social facts and norms do not elevate the individuals, but shackle them. Saussure's definition of language is statistical rather than idealised.\nSaussure argues that language is a 'social fact'; a conventionalised set of rules or norms relating to speech. When at least two people are engaged in conversation, there forms a communicative circuit between the minds of the individual speakers. Saussure explains that language, as a social system, is neither situated in \"speech\" nor in the mind. It only properly exists between the two within the loop. It is located in \u2013 and is the product of \u2013 the collective mind of the linguistic group. An individual has to learn the normative rules of language and can never control them.\nThe task of the linguist is to study language by analysing samples of speech. For practical reasons, this is ordinarily the analysis of written texts. The idea that language is studied through texts is by no means revolutionary as it had been the common practice since the beginning of linguistics. Saussure does not advise against introspection and takes up many linguistic examples without reference to a source in a text corpus. The idea that linguistics is not the study of the mind, however, contradicts Wilhelm Wundt's V\u00f6lkerpsychologie in Saussure's contemporary context; and in a later context, generative grammar and cognitive linguistics.\nA legacy of ideological disputes.\nStructuralism versus generative grammar.\nSaussure's influence was restricted in American linguistics which was dominated by the advocates of Wilhelm Wundt's psychological approach to language, especially Leonard Bloomfield (1887\u20131949). The Bloomfieldian school rejected Saussure's and other structuralists' sociological or even anti-psychological (e.g. Louis Hjelmslev, Lucien Tesni\u00e8re) approaches to theory of language. Problematically, the post-Bloomfieldian school was nicknamed 'American structuralism', causing confusion. Although Bloomfield denounced Wundt's V\u00f6lkerpsychologie and opted for behavioural psychology in his 1933 textbook \"Language\", he and other American linguists stuck to Wundt's practice of analysing the grammatical object as part of the verb phrase. Since this practice is not semantically motivated, they argued for the disconnectedness of syntax from semantics, thus fully rejecting structuralism.\nThe question remained why the object should be in the verb phrase, vexing American linguists for decades. The post-Bloomfieldian approach was eventually reformed as a sociobiological framework by Noam Chomsky who argued that linguistics is a cognitive science; and claimed that linguistic structures are the manifestation of a random mutation in the human genome. Advocates of the new school, generative grammar, claim that Saussure's structuralism has been reformed and replaced by Chomsky's modern approach to linguistics. Jan Koster asserts:\nFrench historian and philosopher Fran\u00e7ois Dosse however argues that there have been various misunderstandings. He points out that Chomsky's criticism of 'structuralism' is directed at the Bloomfieldian school and not the proper address of the term; and that structural linguistics is not to be reduced to mere sentence analysis. It is also argued that\nSaussure versus the social Darwinists.\nSaussure's \"Course in General Linguistics\" begins and ends with a criticism of 19th century linguistics where he is especially critical of Volkgeist thinking and the evolutionary linguistics of August Schleicher and his colleagues. Saussure's ideas replaced social Darwinism in Europe as it was banished from humanities at the end of World War II.\nThe publication of Richard Dawkins's memetics in 1976 brought the Darwinian idea of linguistic units as cultural replicators back to vogue. It became necessary for adherents of this movement to redefine linguistics in a way that would be simultaneously anti-Saussurean and anti-Chomskyan. This led to a redefinition of old humanistic terms such as structuralism, formalism, functionalism and constructionism along Darwinian lines through debates which were marked by an acrimonious tone. In a functionalism\u2013formalism debate of the decades following The Selfish Gene, the 'functionalism' camp attacking Saussure's legacy includes frameworks such as Cognitive Linguistics, Construction Grammar, Usage-based linguistics and Emergent Linguistics. Arguing for 'functional-typological theory', William Croft criticises Saussure's use or the organic analogy:\nStructural linguist Henning Andersen disagrees with Croft. He criticises memetics and other models of cultural evolution and points out that the concept of 'adaptation' is not to be taken in linguistics in the same meaning as in biology. Humanistic and structuralistic notions are likewise defended by Esa Itkonen and Jacques Fran\u00e7ois; the Saussurean standpoint is explained and defended by Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hoskovec, representing the Prague Linguistic Circle.\nConversely, other cognitive linguists claim to continue and expand Saussure's work on the bilateral sign. Dutch philologist Elise Elffers, however, argues that their view of the subject is incompatible with Saussure's own ideas.\nPolitical controversies.\nThere had long been disagreements between structuralists and Marxists, and after the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe, structural linguists who found themselves behind the Iron Curtain were labelled dissidents. From 1948 onwards the communist government of Czechoslovakia forced the Prague Linguistic Circle to publish a series of writings repudiating structuralism, and to rally around the banner of dialectical materialism. For example, Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd publicly denounced structuralism in his 'confession' as the product of 'bourgeois scholarship', arguing that its role\nThe original Prague Linguistic Circle disbanded in 1953 due to its problems with the socialist regime.\nIn Western Europe, in contrast, Saussure's work became widely influential as the structuralists led by Michel Foucault rose to academic power at the Sorbonne after the student revolts of Spring 1968. Their intention was to replace Marxism by redefining leftism as a struggle for equality of all social categories. Structural linguistics was taken as the model science for humanities. Soon enough it was however noted that, as a scientific enterprise, structuralism was too conservative to serve the purpose. This led to new paradigms of post-structuralism. Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism, for example, does not take as its goal the recognition of binary oppositions but that of their deconstruction. Structuralism also became criticised for its denial that the individual can change the social norm, and labelled as 'anti-humanistic' by many.\nThe post-structuralists, after having extended their method to natural sciences, were eventually attacked by Chomsky's allies, including Jean Bricmont, in the Science Wars.\nThe term 'structuralism' continues to be used in structural\u2013functional linguistics which despite the contrary claims defines itself as a humanistic approach to language."}
{"id": "11042", "revid": "30212854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11042", "title": "Fat", "text": "In nutrition, biology, and chemistry, fat usually means any ester of fatty acids, or a mixture of such compounds; most commonly those that occur in living beings or in food.\nThe term often refers specifically to triglycerides (triple esters of glycerol), that are the main components of vegetable oils and of fatty tissue in animals; or, even more narrowly, to triglycerides that are solid or semisolid at room temperature, thus excluding oils. The term may also be used more broadly as a synonym of lipid -- any substance of biological relevance, composed of carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen, that is insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvents. In this sense, besides the triglycerides, the term would include several other types of compounds like mono- and diglycerides, phospholipids (such as lecithin), sterols (such as cholesterol), waxes (such as beeswax), and free fatty acids, which are usually present in human diet in smaller amounts.\nFats are one of the three main macronutrient groups in human diet, along with carbohydrates and proteins, and the main components of common food products like milk, butter, tallow, lard, bacon, and cooking oils. They are a major and dense source of food energy for many animals and play important structural and metabolic functions, in most living beings, including energy storage, waterproofing, and thermal insulation. The human body can produce the fat that it needs from other food ingredients, except for a few essential fatty acids that must be included in the diet. Dietary fats are also the carriers of some flavor and aroma ingredients and vitamins that are not water-soluble.\nChemical structure.\nThe most important elements in the chemical makeup of fats are the fatty acids. The molecule of a fatty acid consists of a carboxyl group connected to an unbranched alkyl group \u2013H: namely, a chain of carbon atoms, joined by single, double, or (more rarely) triple bonds, with all remaining free bonds filled by hydrogen atoms\nThe most common type of fat, in human diet and most living beings, is a triglyceride, an ester of the triple alcohol glycerol and three fatty acids. The molecule of a triglyceride can be described as resulting from a condensation reaction (specifically, esterification) between each of glycerol's \u2013OH groups and the HO\u2013 part of the carboxyl group of each fatty acid, forming an ester bridge with elimination of a water molecule .\nOther less common types of fats include diglycerides and monoglycerides, where the esterification is limited to two or just one of glycerol's \u2013OH groups. Other alcohols, such as cetyl alcohol (predominant in spermaceti), may replace glycerol. In the phospholipids, one of the fatty acids is replaced by phosphoric acid or a monoester thereof.\nConformation.\nThe shape of fat and fatty acid molecules is usually not well-defined. Any two parts of a molecule that are connected by just one single bond are free to rotate about that bond. Thus a fatty acid molecule with \"n\" simple bonds can be deformed in \"n\"-1 independent ways (counting also rotation of the terminal methyl group). \nSuch rotation cannot happen across a double bond, except by breaking and then reforming it with one of the halves of the molecule rotated by 180 degrees, which requires crossing a significant energy barrier. Thus a fat or fatty acid molecule with double bonds (excluding at the very end of the chain) can have multiple cis-trans isomers with significantly different chemical and biological properties. Each double bond reduces the number of conformational degrees of freedom by one. Each triple bond forces the four nearest carbons to lie in a straight line, removing two degrees of freedom. \nIt follows that depictions of \"saturated\" fatty acids with no double bonds (like stearic) having a \"straight zig-zag\" shape, and those with one \"cis\" bond (like oleic) being bent in an \"elbow\" shape are somewhat misleading. While the latter are a little less flexible, both can be twisted to assume similar straight or elbow shapes. In fact, outside of some specific contexts like crystals or bilayer membranes, both are more likely to be found in randomly contorted configurations than in either of those two shapes.\nExamples.\nStearic acid is a saturated fatty acid (with only single bonds) found in animal fats, and is the intended product in full hydrogenation. \nOleic acid has a double bond (thus being \"unsaturated\") with \"cis\" geometry about midway in the chain; it makes up 55\u201380% of olive oil. \nElaidic acid is its \"trans\" isomer; it may be present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, and also occurs in the fat of the durian fruit (about 2%) and in milk fat (less than 0.1%). \nVaccenic acid is another \"trans\" acid that differs from elaidic only in the position of the double bond; it also occurs in milk fat (about 1-2%).\nNomenclature.\nCommon fat names.\nFats are usually named after their source (like olive oil, cod liver oil, shea butter, tail fat) or have traditional names of their own (like butter, lard, ghee, and margarine). Some of these names refer to products that contain substantial amounts of other components besides fats proper.\nChemical fatty acid names.\nIn chemistry and biochemistry, dozens of saturated fatty acids and of hundreds of unsaturated ones have traditional scientific/technical names usually inspired by their source fats (butyric, caprylic, stearic, oleic, palmitic, and nervonic), but sometimes their discoverer (mead, osbond). \nA triglyceride would then be named as an ester of those acids, such as \"glyceryl 1,2-dioleate 3-palmitate\".\nIUPAC.\nIn the general chemical nomenclature developed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the recommended name of a fatty acid, derived from the name of the corresponding hydrocarbon, completely describes its structure, by specifying the number of carbons and the number and position of the double bonds. Thus, for example, oleic acid would be called \"(9Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid\", meaning that it has an 18 carbon chain (\"octadec\") with a carboxyl at one end (\"oic\") and a double bound at carbon 9 counting from the carboxyl (\"9-en\"), and that the configuration of the single bonds adjacent to that double bond is \"cis\" (\"(9Z)\") The IUPAC nomenclature can also handle branched chains and derivatives where hydrogen atoms are replaced by other chemical groups.\nA triglyceride would then be named according to general ester rules as, for example, \"propane-1,2,3-tryl 1,2-bis((9Z)-octadec-9-enoate) 3-(hexadecanoate)\".\nFatty acid code.\nA notation specific for fatty acids with unbranched chain, that is as precise as the IUPAC one but easier to parse, is a code of the form \"{N}:{D} cis-{CCC} trans-{TTT}\", where {N} is the number of carbons (including the carboxyl one), {D} is the number of double bonds, {CCC} is a list of the positions of the \"cis\" double bonds, and {TTT} is a list of the positions of the \"trans\" bounds. Either list and the label is omitted if there are no bounds of that type. \nThus, for example, the codes for stearic, oleic, elaidic, and vaccenic acids would be \"18:0\", \"18:1 cis-9\", \"18:1 trans-9\", and \"18:1 trans-11\", respectively. The code for \u03b1-oleostearic acid, which is \"(9E,11E,13Z)-octadeca-9,11,13-trienoic acid\" in the IUPAC nomenclature, has the code \"18:3 trans-9,11 cis-13\"\nClassification.\nBy chain length.\nFats can be classified according to the lengths of the carbon chains of their constituent fatty acids. Most chemical properties, such as melting point and acidity, vary gradually with this parameter, so there is no sharp division. Chemically, formic acid (1 carbon) and acetic acid (2 carbons) could be viewed as the shortest fatty acids; then triformin would be the simplest triglyceride. However, the terms \"fatty acid\" and \"fat\" are usually reserved for compounds with substantially longer chains.\nA division commonly made in biochemistry and nutrition is:\nA triglyceride molecule may have fatty acid elements of different lengths, and a fat product will often be a mix of various triglycerides. Most fats found in food, whether vegetable or animal, are made up of medium to long-chain fatty acids, usually of equal or nearly equal length.\nSaturated and unsaturated fats.\nFor human nutrition, an important classification of fats is based on the number and position of double bonds in the constituent fatty acids. Saturated fat has a predominance of saturated fatty acids, without any double bonds, while unsaturated fat has predominantly unsaturated acids with double bonds. (The names refer to the fact that each double bond means two fewer hydrogen atoms in the chemical formula. Thus, a saturated fatty acid, having no double bonds, has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms for a given number of carbon atoms \u2014 that is, it is \"saturated\" with hydrogen atoms.)\nUnsaturated fatty acids are further classified into monounsaturated (MUFAs), with a single double bond, and polyunsaturated (PUFAs), with two or more. Natural fats usually contain several different saturated and unsaturated acids, even on the same molecule. For example, in most vegetable oils, the saturated palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acid residues are usually attached to positions 1 and 3 (sn1 and sn3) of the glycerol hub, whereas the middle position (sn2) is usually occupied by an unsaturated one, such as oleic (C18:1, \u03c9\u20139) or linoleic (C18:2, \u03c9\u20136).)\nWhile it is the \"nutritional\" aspects of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are generally of greatest interest, these materials also have non-food applications. They include the drying oils, such as linseed (flax seed), tung, poppy seed, perilla, and walnut oil, which polymerize on exposure to oxygen to form solid films, and are used to make paints and varnishes.\nSaturated fats generally have a higher melting point than unsaturated ones with the same molecular weight, and thus are more likely to be solid at room temperature. For example, the animal fats tallow and lard are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids. Olive and linseed oils on the other hand are unsaturated and liquid. Unsaturated fats are prone to oxidation by air, which causes them to become rancid and inedible.\nThe double bonds in unsaturated fats can be converted into single bonds by reaction with hydrogen effected by a catalyst. This process, called hydrogenation, is used to turn vegetable oils into solid or semisolid vegetable fats like margarine, which can substitute for tallow and butter and (unlike unsaturated fats) can be stored indefinitely without becoming rancid. However, partial hydrogenation also creates some unwanted \"trans\" acids from \"cis\" acids.\nIn cellular metabolism, unsaturated fat molecules yield slightly less energy (i.e., fewer calories) than an equivalent amount of saturated fat. The heats of combustion of saturated, mono-, di-, and tri-unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acid esters have been measured as 2859, 2828, 2794, and 2750 kcal/mol, respectively; or, on a weight basis, 10.75, 10.71, 10.66, and 10.58 kcal/g \u2014 a decrease of about 0.6% for each additional double bond.\nThe greater the degree of unsaturation in a fatty acid (i.e., the more double bonds in the fatty acid) the more vulnerable it is to lipid peroxidation (rancidity). Antioxidants can protect unsaturated fat from lipid peroxidation.\nCis and trans fats.\nAnother important classification of unsaturated fatty acids considers the \"cis\"-\"trans\" isomerism, the spatial arrangement of the C\u2013C single bonds adjacent to the double bonds. Most unsaturated fatty acids that occur in nature have those bonds in the \"cis\" (\"same side\") configuration. Partial hydrogenation of \"cis\" fats can turn some of their fatty acids into \"trans\" (\"opposite sides\") variety.\nElaidic acid is the \"trans\" isomer of oleic acid, one of the most common fatty acids in human diet. The single change of configuration in one double bond causes them to have different chemical and physical properties. Elaidic acid has a much higher melting point than oleic acid, 45 \u00b0C instead of 13.4 \u00b0C. This difference is commonly attributed to the supposed ability of the trans molecules to pack more tightly, forming a solid that is more difficult to break apart.\nOmega number.\nAnother classification considers the position of the double bonds relative to the \"end\" of the chain (opposite to the carboxyl group). The position is denoted by \"\u03c9\u2212\"k\"\" or \"n\u2212\"k\"\", meaning that there is a double bond between carbons \"k\" and \"k\"+1 counted from 1 at that end. For example, alpha-Linolenic acid is a \"\u03c9\u22123\" or \"n\u22123\" acid, meaning that there is a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, counted from that end; that is, its structural formula ends with \u2013CH=CH\u2013\u2013.\nExamples of saturated fatty acids.\nSome common examples of fatty acids:\nBiological importance.\nIn humans and many animals, fats serve both as energy sources and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately. Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about 9 food calories (37 kJ = 8.8 kcal).\nFats are also sources of essential fatty acids, an important dietary requirement. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble, meaning they can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats. \nFats play a vital role in maintaining healthy skin and hair, insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function. Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases. When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute\u2014or at least maintain equilibrium of\u2014the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue. This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as excretion, urination, accidental or intentional bloodletting, sebum excretion, and hair growth.\nAdipose tissue.\nIn animals, adipose tissue, or fatty tissue is the body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. Adipocytes (fat cells) store fat derived from the diet and from liver metabolism. Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the circulation. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon and epinephrine). Adipose tissue also secretes the hormone leptin. \nThe location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile: visceral fat is located within the abdominal wall (i.e., beneath the wall of abdominal muscle) whereas subcutaneous fat is located beneath the skin (and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but \"above\" the abdominal muscle wall). Visceral fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals (i.e., hormones), among which several are involved in inflammatory tissue responses. One of these is resistin which has been linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. This latter result is currently controversial, and there have been reputable studies supporting all sides on the issue.\nProduction and processing.\nA variety of chemical and physical techniques are used for the production and processing of fats, both industrially and in cottage or home settings. They include:\nNutritional and health aspects.\nThe benefits and risks of various amounts and types of dietary fats have been the object of much study, and are still highly controversial topics.\nEssential fatty acids.\nThere are two essential fatty acids (EFAs) in human nutrition: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats.\nSaturated vs. unsaturated fats.\nDifferent foods contain different amounts of fat with different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Some animal products, like beef and dairy products made with whole or reduced fat milk like yogurt, ice cream, cheese and butter have mostly saturated fatty acids (and some have significant contents of dietary cholesterol). Other animal products, like pork, poultry, eggs, and seafood have mostly unsaturated fats. Industrialized baked goods may use fats with high unsaturated fat contents as well, especially those containing partially hydrogenated oils, and processed foods that are deep-fried in hydrogenated oil are high in saturated fat content..\nPlants and fish oil generally contain a higher proportion of unsaturated acids, although there are exceptions such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil. Foods containing unsaturated fats include avocado, nuts, olive oils, and vegetable oils such as canola.\nMany careful studies have found that replacing saturated fats with \"cis\" unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of risks of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or death. These studies prompted many medical organizations and public health departments, including the World Health Organization, to officially issue that advice. Some countries with such recommendations include:\nA 2004 review concluded that \"no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified\" and recommended that the influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies.\nThis advice is often oversimplified by labeling the two kinds of fats as \"bad fats\" and \"good fats\", respectively. However, since the fats and oils in most natural and traditionally processed foods contain both unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, the complete exclusion of saturated fat is unrealistic and possibly unwise. For instance, some foods rich in saturated fat, such as coconut and palm oil, are an important source of cheap dietary calories for a large fraction of the population in developing countries. \nConcerns were also expressed at a 2010 conference of the American Dietetic Association that a blanket recommendation to avoid saturated fats could drive people to also reduce the amount of polyunsaturated fats, which may have health benefits, and/or replace fats by refined carbohydrates \u2014 which carry a high risk of obesity and heart disease.\nFor these reasons, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, does not advise the complete elimination of saturated fat, but only recommends that it does not exceed 30% of one's daily caloric intake. A 2003 report by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends limiting the saturated fatty acids to less than 10% of daily energy intake and less than 7% for high-risk groups. A general 7% limit was recommended also by the American Heart Association in 2006. \nThe WHO/FAO report also recommended replacing fats so as to reduce the content of myristic and palmitic acids, specifically. \nThe so-called Mediterranean diet, prevalent in many countries in the Mediterranean Sea area, includes more total fat than the diet of Northern European countries, but most of it is in the form of unsaturated fatty acids (specifically, monounsaturated and omega-3) from olive oil and fish, vegetables, and certain meats like lamb, while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison.\nA 2017 review found evidence that a Mediterranean-style diet could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, overall cancer incidence, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and mortality rate. A 2018 review showed that a Mediterranean-like diet may improve overall health status, such as reduced risk of non-communicable diseases. It also may reduce the social and economic costs of diet-related illnesses.\nA small number of contemporary reviews have challenged this negative view of saturated fats. For example, an evaluation of evidence from 1966-1973 of the observed health impact of replacing dietary saturated fat with linoleic acid found that it \"increased\" rates of death from all causes, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease. These studies have been disputed by many scientists, and the consensus in the medical community is that saturated fat and cardiovascular disease are closely related. Still, these discordant studies fueled debate over the merits of substituting polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats.\nCardiovascular disease.\nThe effect of saturated fat on cardiovascular disease has been extensively studied. The general consensus is that there is evidence of moderate-quality of a strong, consistent, and graded relationship between saturated fat intake, blood cholesterol levels, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease. The relationships are accepted as causal, including by many government and medical organizations.\nA 2017 review by the American Heart Association estimated that replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat in the American diet could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 30%.\nThe consumption of saturated fat is generally considered a risk factor for dyslipidemia \u2014 abnormal blood lipid levels, including high total cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, \"bad\" cholesterol) or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, \"good\" cholesterol). These parameters in turn are believed to be risk indicators for some types of cardiovascular disease. These effects were observed in children too.\nSeveral meta-analyses (reviews and consolidations of multiple previously published experimental studies) have confirmed a significant relationship between saturated fat and high serum cholesterol levels, which in turn have been claimed to have a causal relation with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (the so-called lipid hypothesis). However, high cholesterol may be caused by many factors. Other indicators, such as high LDL/HDL ratio, have proved to be more predictive. In a study of myocardial infarction in 52 countries, the ApoB/ApoA1 (related to LDL and HDL, respectively) ratio was the strongest predictor of CVD among all risk factors. There are other pathways involving obesity, triglyceride levels, insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, and thrombogenicity, among others, that play a role in CVD, although it seems, in the absence of an adverse blood lipid profile, the other known risk factors have only a weak atherogenic effect. Different saturated fatty acids have differing effects on various lipid levels.\nCancer.\nThe evidence for a relation between saturated fat intake and cancer is significantly weaker, and there does not seem to be a clear medical consensus about it. \nBones.\nVarious animal studies have indicated that the intake of saturated fat has a negative effect on effects on the mineral density of bones. One study suggested that men may be particularly vulnerable.\nDisposition and overall health.\nStudies have shown that substituting monounsaturated fatty acids for saturated ones is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure. More physical activity, less anger, and less irritability were associated with a higher-oleic acid diet than one of a palmitic acid diet.\nMonounsaturated vs. polyunsaturated fat.\nAssuming given that unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) are generally healthier than saturated ones (SFAs), another question that has gained attention in recent decades is the risks and benefits of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs, with a single double bond) versus polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, with two or more double bonds).\nThe most common fatty acids in human diet are unsaturated or mono-unsaturated. Monounsaturated fats are found in animal flesh such as red meat, whole milk products, nuts, and high fat fruits such as olives and avocados. Algal oil is about 92% monounsaturated fat. Olive oil is about 75% monounsaturated fat. The high oleic variety sunflower oil contains at least 70% monounsaturated fat. Canola oil and cashews are both about 58% monounsaturated fat. Tallow (beef fat) is about 50% monounsaturated fat. and lard is about 40% monounsaturated fat. Other sources include hazelnut, avocado oil, macadamia nut oil, grapeseed oil, groundnut oil (peanut oil), sesame oil, corn oil, popcorn, whole grain wheat, cereal, oatmeal, almond oil, sunflower oil, hemp oil, and tea-oil Camellia.\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids can be found mostly in nuts, seeds, fish, seed oils, and oysters. \nFood sources of polyunsaturated fats include:\nCardiovascular disease.\nStudies have given conflicting indications about the effect of MUFA/PUFA intake and cardiovascular disease. Although PUFAs seem to protect against cardiac arrhythmias, a study concluded that PUFA intake is positively associated with coronary atherosclerosis progression in a group of post-menopauseal women, whereas MUFA intake is not. This probably is an indication of the greater vulnerability of polyunsaturated fats to lipid peroxidation, against which vitamin\u00a0E has been shown to be protective.\nInsulin resistance and sensitivity.\nMUFAs (especially oleic acid) have been found to lower the incidence of insulin resistance PUFAs (especially large amounts of arachidonic acid) and SFAs (such as arachidic acid) increased it. These ratios can be indexed in the phospholipids of human skeletal muscle and in other tissues as well. This relationship between dietary fats and insulin resistance is presumed secondary to the relationship between insulin resistance and inflammation, which is partially modulated by dietary fat ratios (Omega-3/6/9) with both omega 3 and 9 thought to be anti-inflammatory, and omega 6 pro-inflammatory (as well as by numerous other dietary components, particularly polyphenols and exercise, with both of these anti-inflammatory). Although both pro- and anti-inflammatory types of fat are biologically necessary, fat dietary ratios in most US diets are skewed towards Omega 6, with subsequent disinhibition of inflammation and potentiation of insulin resistance. But this is contrary to the suggestion of more recent studies, in which polyunsaturated fats are shown as protective against insulin resistance.\nThe large scale KANWU study found that increasing MUFA and decreasing SFA intake could improve insulin sensitivity, but only when the overall fat intake of the diet was low. However, some MUFAs may promote insulin resistance (like the SFAs), whereas PUFAs may protect against it.\nCancer.\nLevels of oleic acid along with other MUFAs in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with breast cancer risk. The saturation index (SI) of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. MUFAs and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer. Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme delta-9 desaturase (\u03949-d).\nResults from observational clinical trials on PUFA intake and cancer have been inconsistent and vary by numerous factors of cancer incidence, including gender and genetic risk. Some studies have shown associations between higher intakes and/or blood levels of omega-3 PUFAs and a decreased risk of certain cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer, while other studies found no associations with cancer risk.\nPregnancy disorders.\nPolyunsaturated fat supplementation was found to have no effect on the incidence of pregnancy-related disorders, such as hypertension or preeclampsia, but may increase the length of gestation slightly and decreased the incidence of early premature births.\nExpert panels in the United States and Europe recommend that pregnant and lactating women consume higher amounts of polyunsaturated fats than the general population to enhance the DHA status of the fetus and newborn.\n\"Cis fat\" vs. \"trans fat\".\nIn nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have double bonds in \"cis\" configuration (with the adjacent C\u2013C bonds on the same side) as opposed to \"trans\". Nevertheless, \"trans\" fatty acids (TFAs) occur in small amounts in meat and milk of ruminants (such as cattle and sheep), typically 2\u20135% of total fat. Natural TFAs, which include conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic acid, originate in the rumen of these animals. CLA has two double bonds, one in the \"cis\" configuration and one in \"trans\", which makes it simultaneously a \"cis\"- and a \"trans\"-fatty acid.\nConcerns about \"trans\" fatty acids in human diet were raised when they were found to be an unintentional byproduct of the partial hydrogenation of vegetable and fish oils. While these \"trans\" fatty acids (popularly called \"trans fats\") are edible, they have been implicated in many health problems.\nThe hydrogenation process, invented and patented by Wilhelm Normann in 1902, made it possible to turn relatively cheap liquid fats such as whale or fish oil into more solid fats and to extend their shelf-life by preventing rancidification. (The source fat and the process were initially kept secret to avoid consumer distaste.) This process was widely adopted by the food industry already in the early 1900s; first for the production of margarine, a replacement for butter and shortening, and eventually for various other fats used in snack food, packaged baked goods, and deep fried products. \nFull hydrogenation of a fat or oil produces a fully saturated fat. However, hydrogenation generally was interrupted before completion, to yield a fat product with specific melting point, hardness, and other properties. Unfortunately, partial hydrogenation turns some of the \"cis\" double bonds into \"trans\" bonds by an isomerization reaction. The trans configuration is favored because it is the lower energy form.\nThis side reaction accounts for most of the \"trans\" fatty acids consumed today, by far. An analysis of some industrialized foods in 2006 found up to 30% \"trans fats\" in artificial shortening, 10% in breads and cake products, 8% in cookies and crackers, 4% in salty snacks, 7% in cake frostings and sweets, and 26% in margarine and other processed spreads. Another 2010 analysis however found only 0.2% of trans fats in margarine and other processed spreads. Up to 45% of the total fat in those foods containing man-made \"trans\" fats formed by partially hydrogenating plant fats may be \"trans\" fat. Baking shortenings, unless reformulated, contain around 30% \"trans\" fats compared to their total fats. High-fat dairy products such as butter contain about 4%. Margarines not reformulated to reduce \"trans\" fats may contain up to 15% \"trans\" fat by weight, but some reformulated ones are less than 1% trans fat. \nHigh levels of TFAs have been recorded in popular \"fast food\" meals. An analysis of samples of McDonald's French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in Hungary, and 28 times as much as in Denmark, where trans fats are restricted. For Kentucky Fried Chicken products, the pattern was reversed: the Hungarian product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product. Even within the United States, there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans fat than those from Atlanta. \nCardiovascular disease.\nNumerous studies have found that consumption of TFAs increases risk of cardiovascular disease. The Harvard School of Public Health advises that replacing TFAs and saturated fats with \"cis\" monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health. \nConsuming trans fats has been shown to increase the risk of coronary artery disease in part by raising levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, often termed \"bad cholesterol\"), lowering levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, often termed \"good cholesterol\"), increasing triglycerides in the bloodstream and promoting systemic inflammation.\nThe primary health risk identified for trans fat consumption is an elevated risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). A 1994 study estimated that over 30,000 cardiac deaths per year in the United States are attributable to the consumption of trans fats. By 2006 upper estimates of 100,000 deaths were suggested. A comprehensive review of studies of trans fats published in 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine reports a strong and reliable connection between trans fat consumption and CAD, concluding that \"On a per-calorie basis, trans fats appear to increase the risk of CAD more than any other macronutrient, conferring a substantially increased risk at low levels of consumption (1 to 3% of total energy intake)\".\nThe major evidence for the effect of trans fat on CAD comes from the Nurses' Health Study \u2013 a cohort study that has been following 120,000 female nurses since its inception in 1976. In this study, Hu and colleagues analyzed data from 900 coronary events from the study's population during 14 years of followup. He determined that a nurse's CAD risk roughly doubled (relative risk of 1.93, CI: 1.43 to 2.61) for each 2% increase in trans fat calories consumed (instead of carbohydrate calories). By contrast, for each 5% increase in saturated fat calories (instead of carbohydrate calories) there was a 17% increase in risk (relative risk of 1.17, CI: 0.97 to 1.41). \"The replacement of saturated fat or trans unsaturated fat by cis (unhydrogenated) unsaturated fats was associated with larger reductions in risk than an isocaloric replacement by carbohydrates.\" Hu also reports on the benefits of reducing trans fat consumption. Replacing 2% of food energy from trans fat with non-trans unsaturated fats more than halves the risk of CAD (53%). By comparison, replacing a larger 5% of food energy from saturated fat with non-trans unsaturated fats reduces the risk of CAD by 43%.\nAnother study considered deaths due to CAD, with consumption of trans fats being linked to an increase in mortality, and consumption of polyunsaturated fats being linked to a decrease in mortality.\nTrans fat has been found to act like saturated in raising the blood level of LDL (\"bad cholesterol\"); but, unlike saturated fat, it also decreases levels of HDL (\"good cholesterol\"). The net increase in LDL/HDL ratio with trans fat, a widely accepted indicator of risk for coronary artery, is approximately double that due to saturated fat. One randomized crossover study published in 2003 comparing the effect of eating a meal on blood lipids of (relatively) cis and trans-fat-rich meals showed that cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) was 28% higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal and that lipoprotein concentrations were enriched in apolipoprotein(a) after the trans meals.\nThe citokyne test is a potentially more reliable indicator of CAD risk, although is still being studied. A study of over 700 nurses showed that those in the highest quartile of trans fat consumption had blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) that were 73% higher than those in the lowest quartile.\nBreast feeding.\nIt has been established that \"trans\" fats in human breast milk fluctuate with maternal consumption of trans fat, and that the amount of trans fats in the bloodstream of breastfed infants fluctuates with the amounts found in their milk. In 1999, reported percentages of trans fats (compared to total fats) in human milk ranged from 1% in Spain, 2% in France, 4% in Germany, and 7% in Canada and the United States.\nOther health risks.\nThere are suggestions that the negative consequences of trans fat consumption go beyond the cardiovascular risk. In general, there is much less scientific consensus asserting that eating trans fat specifically increases the risk of other chronic health problems:\nBiochemical mechanisms.\nThe exact biochemical process by which trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research. Intake of dietary trans fat perturbs the body's ability to metabolize essential fatty acids (EFAs, including Omega-3) leading to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition of the arterial walls, thereby raising risk of coronary artery disease.\nTrans double bonds are claimed to induce a linear conformation to the molecule, favoring its rigid packing as in plaque formation. The geometry of the \"cis\" double bond, in contrast, is claimed to create a bend in the molecule, thereby precluding rigid formations..\nWhile the mechanisms through which trans fatty acids contribute to coronary artery disease are fairly well understood, the mechanism for their effects on diabetes is still under investigation. They may impair the metabolism of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). However, maternal pregnancy trans fatty acid intake has been inversely associated with LCPUFAs levels in infants at birth thought to underlie the positive association between breastfeeding and intelligence.\nTrans fats are processed by the liver differently than other fats. They may cause liver dysfunction by interfering with delta 6 desaturase, an enzyme involved in converting essential fatty acids to arachidonic acid and prostaglandins, both of which are important to the functioning of cells.\nNatural \"trans fats\" in dairy products.\nSome \"trans\" fatty acids occur in natural fats and traditionally processed foods. Vaccenic acid occurs in breast milk, and some isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) are found in meat and dairy products from ruminants. Butter, for example, contains about 3% trans fat.\nThe US National Dairy Council has asserted that the trans fats present in animal foods are of a different type than those in partially hydrogenated oils, and do not appear to exhibit the same negative effects. While a recent scientific review agrees with the conclusion (stating that \"the sum of the current evidence suggests that the Public health implications of consuming trans fats from ruminant products are relatively limited\"), it cautions that this may be due to the low consumption of trans fats from animal sources compared to artificial ones.\nMore recent inquiry (independent of the dairy industry) has found in a 2008 Dutch meta-analysis that all trans fats, regardless of natural or artificial origin equally raise LDL and lower HDL levels. Other studies though have shown different results when it comes to animal-based trans fats like conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Although CLA is known for its anticancer properties, researchers have also found that the cis-9, trans-11 form of CLA can reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease and help fight inflammation.\nTwo Canadian studies have shown that vaccenic acid, a TFA that naturally occurs in dairy products, could be beneficial compared to hydrogenated vegetable shortening, or a mixture of pork lard and soy fat, by lowering total LDL and triglyceride levels. A study by the US Department of Agriculture showed that vaccenic acid raises both HDL and LDL cholesterol, whereas industrial trans fats only raise LDL with no beneficial effect on HDL.\nOfficial recommendations.\nIn light of recognized evidence and scientific agreement, nutritional authorities consider all trans fats equally harmful for health and recommend that their consumption be reduced to trace amounts. The World Health Organization recommended that trans fats make up no more than 0.9% of a person's diet in 2003 and, in 2018, introduced a 6-step guide to eliminate industrially-produced trans-fatty acids from the global food supply.\nThe National Academy of Sciences (NAS) advises the United States and Canadian governments on nutritional science for use in public policy and product labeling programs. Their 2002 \"Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids\" contains their findings and recommendations regarding consumption of trans fat (summary).\nTheir recommendations are based on two key facts. First, \"trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health\", whether of animal or plant origin. Second, given their documented effects on the LDL/HDL ratio, the NAS concluded \"that dietary trans fatty acids are more deleterious with respect to coronary artery disease than saturated fatty acids\". A 2006 review published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) that states \"from a nutritional standpoint, the consumption of trans fatty acids results in considerable potential harm but no apparent benefit.\"\nBecause of these facts and concerns, the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary artery disease.\nDespite this concern, the NAS dietary recommendations have not included eliminating trans fat from the diet. This is because trans fat is naturally present in many animal foods in trace quantities, and thus its removal from ordinary diets might introduce undesirable side effects and nutritional imbalances. The NAS has, thus, \"recommended that trans fatty acid consumption be as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet\". Like the NAS, the World Health Organization has tried to balance public health goals with a practical level of trans fat consumption, recommending in 2003 that trans fats be limited to less than 1% of overall energy intake.\nRegulatory action.\nIn the last few decades, there has been substantial amount of regulation in many countries, limiting trans fat contents of industrialized and commercial food products.\nAlternatives to hydrogenation.\nIn recent years, the negative public image and strict regulations have driven many fat processing industries to replace partial hydrogenation by fat interesterification, a process that chemically scrambles the fatty acids among a mix of triglycerides. When applied to a suitable bend of oils and saturated fats, possibly followed by separation of unwanted solid or liquid triglycerides, this process can achieve results similar to those of partial hydrogenation without affecting the fatty acids themselves; in particular, without creating any new \"trans fat\".\nResearchers at the United States Department of Agriculture have investigated whether hydrogenation can be achieved without the side effect of trans fat production. They varied the pressure under which the chemical reaction was conducted \u2013 applying 1400\u00a0kPa (200\u00a0psi) of pressure to soybean oil in a 2-liter vessel while heating it to between 140\u00a0\u00b0C and 170\u00a0\u00b0C. The standard 140\u00a0kPa (20\u00a0psi) process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40% trans fatty acid by weight, compared to about 17% using the high-pressure method. Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, the high-pressure-processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6% trans fat. Based on current U.S. labeling requirements (see below), the manufacturer could claim the product was free of trans fat. The level of trans fat may also be altered by modification of the temperature and the length of time during hydrogenation.\nA University of Guelph research group has found a way to mix oils (such as olive, soybean, and canola), water, monoglycerides, and fatty acids to form a \"cooking fat\" that acts the same way as trans and saturated fats.\nOmega-three and omega-six fatty acids.\nThe \u03c9\u22123 fatty acids have received substantial atterntion in recent years.\nIn preliminary research, omega-3 fatty acids in algal oil, fish oil, fish and seafood have been shown to lower the risk of heart attacks. Other preliminary research indicates that omega-6 fatty acids in sunflower oil and safflower oil may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nAmong omega-3 fatty acids, neither long-chain nor short-chain forms were consistently associated with breast cancer risk. High levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), however, the most abundant omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in erythrocyte (red blood cell) membranes, were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. The DHA obtained through the consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids is positively associated with cognitive and behavioral performance. In addition DHA is vital for the grey matter structure of the human brain, as well as retinal stimulation and neurotransmission.\nInteresterification.\nSome studies have investigated the health effects of insteresterified (IE) fats, by comparing diets with IE and non-IE fats with the same overall fatty acid composition.\nSeveral experimental studies in humans found no statistical difference on fasting blood lipids between a with large amounts of IE fat, having 25-40% C16:0 or C18:0 on the 2-position, and a similar diet with non-IE fat, having only 3-9% C16:0 or C18:0 on the 2-position. A negative result was obtained also in a study that compared the effects on blood cholesterol levels of an IE fat product mimicking cocoa butter and the real non-IE product. \nA 2007 study funded by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board claimed that replacing natural palm oil by other interesterified or partial hydrogenated fats caused adverse health effects, such as higher LDL/HDL ratio and plasma glucose levels. However, these effects could be attributed to the higher percentage of saturated acids in the IE and partially hydrogenated fats, rather than to the IE process itself.\nFat digestion and metabolism.\nFats are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents, glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol itself can be converted to glucose by the liver and so become a source of energy. Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called lipases produced in the pancreas. \nMany cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids as a source of energy for metabolism. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids.

When a front (an intentional or unintentional boundary) between opposing sides forms, the front line is the area where each side's forces are engaged in conflict. Leaders have often fought at the front lines either purposefully or due to a collapse in battle formation. While a calculated risk, fighting on the front has in instances reduced communication and heightened morale. \nAll branches of the U.S. armed services use the related technical terms, Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT) and Forward Edge of Battle Area (FEBA). These terms are used as battlespace control measures that designate the forward-most friendly maritime or land forces on the battlefield at a given point in time during an armed conflict. FLOT/FEBA may include covering and screening forces. The Forward Line of Enemy Troops (FLET) is the FEBA from the enemy's perspective.\nEtymology.\nAlthough the term \"front line\" first appeared in the 1520s, it was only in 1842 that it was recorded used in the military sense. Its first use as an adjective was from 1915.\nThe word \"front\" gained the military sense of \"foremost part of an army\" in the mid-14th century, which, in turn, led the word to take on the meaning \"field of operations in contact with the enemy\" in the 1660s. That sense led to the phrase home front, which first appeared in 1919. In a non-combat situation or when a combat situation is not assumed, front can mean the direction in which the command is faced.\nThe attributive adjective version of the term front line (as in \"our front-line personnel\") describes materiel or personnel intended for or actively in forward use: at sea, on land or in the air: \"at\" the front line.\nGenerals who Fought on the Front Line.\nOn Sept. 10 1941 marshal Klim Voroshilov personally led an attack of Soviet marines on German positions and received a serious wound in his arm. During the Stalingrad battle in 1942 general Victor Zholudev fought with a submachine-gun beside his troops. \nWolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, used to pilot his own little unarmed \u201cStorch\u201d aircraft directly over enemy positions, guiding the attacks of his bombers over radio with a precision measured in meters. On many occasions he was almost killed by enemy anti-aircraft fire. On rare occasions when he couldn\u2019t fly, he was personally in the front of advancing German tanks, again, guiding bomber strikes at enemy positions.\nAfter Emperor Hirohito\u2019s radio broadcast conceding defeat on August 15, 1945, Admiral Matome Ugaki participated in a kamikaze mission, and was killed when his plane was shot down by antiaircraft fire.\nGeneral Urquhart, a british paratrooper general, fought on front lines in two engagements.\nEvolution of the concept.\nIn the land campaigns of World War I, FEBAs, FLOTs and FLETs could often be identified by eye. For example, in France and Belgium they were defined by opposing defensive trench systems.\nTypical modern conflicts are vastly different, characterised by \"war amongst the people\", the concept of a \"Three Block War\", and the presence of an asymmetric threat from irregular or terrorist combatants. In those cases, the concepts of front line, FEBA, FLOT and FLET may be of little relevance. The term \"front line\" has come to refer more to any place where bullets and bombs are flying or are likely to fly."}
{"id": "11049", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11049", "title": "FIFA", "text": "FIFA ( , ', '; \"\") is a non-profit organization which describes itself as an international governing body of association football, f\u00fatsal and beach soccer. It is the highest governing body of association football.\nFIFA was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered in Z\u00fcrich, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. These national associations must each also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: Africa, Asia, Europe, North &amp; Central America and the Caribbean, Oceania, and South America.\nToday, FIFA outlines a number of objectives in the organizational Statutes, including growing association football internationally, providing efforts to ensure it is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play. FIFA is responsible for the organization and promotion of association football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the rules of the game, that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions. All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorship; in 2018, FIFA had revenues of over US $4.6\u00a0billion, ending the 2015\u20132018 cycle with a net positive of US$1.2\u00a0billion, and had cash reserves of over US$2.7\u00a0billion.\nReports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017 reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borb\u00e9ly and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal, FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borb\u00e9ly and Eckert. Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed.\nHistory.\nThe need for a single body to oversee association football became apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904. The French name and acronym are used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by the then-Madrid Football Club; the Royal Spanish Football Federation was not created until 1913), Sweden and Switzerland. Also, that same day, the German Football Association (DFB) declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.\nThe first president of FIFA was Robert Gu\u00e9rin. Gu\u00e9rin was replaced in 1906 by Daniel Burley Woolfall from England, by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.\nMembership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912, Canada and Chile in 1913, and the United States in 1914.\nThe 1912 Spalding Athletic Library \"Official Guide\" include information on the 1912 Olympics (scores and stories), AAFA, and FIFA. The 1912 FIFA President being Dan B Woolfall. Daniel Burley Woolfall was president from 1906 to 1918 \nDuring World War I, with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their membership.\nThe FIFA collection is held by the National Football Museum at Urbis in Manchester, England. The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Montevideo, Uruguay.\nFlag.\nThe FIFA flag has a blue background, with the organization's logo in the middle.\nThe current FIFA flag was first flown during the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Moscow, Russia and has been used ever since.\nAnthem.\nAkin to the UEFA Champions League, FIFA has adopted an anthem composed by the German composer Franz Lambert since the 1994 FIFA World Cup. It has been re-arranged and produced by Rob May and Simon Hill. The FIFA Anthem is played at the beginning of official FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such as international friendlies, the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, Football at the Summer Olympics, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA Women's U-17 World Cup, FIFA Futsal World Cup, FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.\nSince 2007, FIFA has also required most of its broadcast partners to use short sequences including the anthem at the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage, as well as for break bumpers, to help promote FIFA's sponsors. This emulates practices long used by some other international football events such as the UEFA Champions League. Exceptions may be made for specific events; for example, an original piece of African music was used for bumpers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nStructure.\nSix confederations and 211 national associations.\nBesides its worldwide institutions, there are six confederations recognized by FIFA which oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA's statutes, and membership of a confederation is a prerequisite to FIFA membership.\n Asian Football Confederation (AFC; 47 members)\n Confederation of African Football (CAF; 56 members)\n Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF; 41 members)\n Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol (CONMEBOL; 10 members)\n Oceania Football Confederation (OFC; 14 members)\n Union of European Football Associations (UEFA; 55 members)\nIn total, FIFA recognizes 211 national associations and their associated men's national teams as well as 129 women's national teams; see the list of national football teams and their respective country codes. The number of FIFA member associations is higher than the number of UN member states as FIFA has admitted associations from 23 non-sovereign entities as members in their own right, such as the four Home Nations within the United Kingdom and politically disputed territories such as Palestine.\nThe FIFA Working Committee of Small Nations has categorized potential FIFA members into three categories:\nThe FIFA World Rankings are updated monthly and rank each team based on their performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches. There is also a world ranking for women's football, updated four times a year.\nLaws and governance.\nFIFA is headquartered in Z\u00fcrich, and is an association established under the law of Switzerland.\nFIFA's supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA, its general secretary, and the other members of the FIFA Council in the year following the FIFA World Cup.\nFIFA Council \u2013 formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president \u2013 is the main decision-making body of the organization in the intervals of congress. The council is composed of 37 people: the president; 8 vice presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The Executive Committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.\nThe president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. Gianni Infantino is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president Sepp Blatter was suspended pending a corruption investigation.\nFIFA's worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies, under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, the FIFA Ethics Committee, the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Referees Committee.\nThe FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular meetings of the FIFA Council. The Emergency Committee consists of the FIFA president as well as one member from each confederation. Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting.\nAdministrative cost.\nFIFA publishes its results according to IFRS. The total compensation for the management committee in 2011 was 30\u00a0million for 35 people. Blatter, the only full-time person on the committee, earned approximately two million Swiss francs, 1.2\u00a0million in salary and the rest in bonuses. A report in London's \"The Sunday Times\" in June 2014 said the members of the committee had their salaries doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 during the year. The report also said leaked documents had indicated $4.4\u00a0million in secret bonuses had been paid to the committee members following the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.\nGovernance.\nThe laws that govern football, known officially as the Laws of the Game, are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the International Football Association Board (IFAB). FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad hoc committees.\nDiscipline of national associations.\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning properly.\nA 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of two former Ireland internationals. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.\nVideo replay and goal-line technology.\nFIFA now permits the use of video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions. However, for most of FIFA's history it stood opposed to its use. The 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board \"agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee\". As recently as 2008 FIFA president Sepp Blatter said: \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision \u2013 a man, not a machine.\" This stance was finally overturned on 3 March 2018, when the IFAB wrote video assistant referees (also known as VARs) into the Laws of the Game on a permanent basis. Their use remains optional for competitions.\nIn early July 2012 FIFA sanctioned the use of goal-line technology, subject to rules specified by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), who had officially approved its use by amending the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) its use. This followed a high-profile incident during a second-round game in the 2010 FIFA World Cup between England and Germany, where a shot by Englishman Frank Lampard, which would have levelled the scores at 2\u20132 in a match that ultimately ended in a 4\u20131 German victory, crossed the line but was not seen to do so by the match officials, which led FIFA officials to declare that they would re-examine the use of goal-line technology.\nRecognitions and awards.\nFIFA holds an annual awards ceremony, The Best FIFA Football Awards since 2016, which recognizes both individual and team achievements in international association football. Individually, the top men's player is awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player and the top women's player is The Best FIFA Women's Player. Another main awards are The Best FIFA Football Coach and FIFA FIFPro World11.\nIn 2000 FIFA presented two awards, FIFA Club of the Century and FIFA Player of the Century, to decide the greatest football club and player of the 20th century. Real Madrid was the club winner, while Diego Maradona and Pel\u00e9 were the joint players winners.\nFIFA competitions.\nNational teams.\nMen's\nWomen's\nClubs.\nMen's\nWomen's\neSports.\nIndividual\nTeam\nFIFA world rankings.\nTop 5 men's national football teams.\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nTop 5 women's national football teams.\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nRanking Table\nCorruption.\nIn May 2006, British investigative reporter Andrew Jennings' book \"Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals\" (Harper Collins) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for Sepp Blatter's continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of \"Foul!\" a BBC \"Panorama\" expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of bribes pocketed by football officials. Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a mafia family\", highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and corruption\".\nAll testimonies offered in the \"Panorama\" expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. Brennan\u2014the highest-level African-American in the history of world football governance\u2014joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money by CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of corruption by FIFA in late 2010, both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA has Brennan called directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport throughout the world.\nIn a further \"Panorama\" expos\u00e9 broadcast on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou and Ricardo Teixeira, had been paid huge bribes by ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100\u00a0million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, Jack Warner, has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' \"Panorama\" also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket tax exemption for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of workers rights. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the Dutch government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.\nPrime Minister David Cameron and Andy Anson, head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, on the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme.\nIn June 2011, it came to light that the International Olympic Committee had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president Jo\u00e3o Havelange into claims of bribery. \"Panorama\" alleged that Havelange accepted a $1\u00a0million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it \"takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".\nIn a 2014 interview, American sportswriter Dave Zirin said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership and that the organization should be abolished for the good of the game. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in association football matches, and marketing and selling the sport, but that two \"separate\" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like, and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that's responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.\nIn May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.\nGuilty pleas.\nBetween 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges. The pleas of Chuck Blazer, Jos\u00e9 Hawilla, Daryan Warner, Darrell Warner, Traffic Group and Traffic Sports USA were unsealed in May 2015. In another 2015 case, Singapore also imposed a 6-year \"harshest sentence ever received for match-fixing\" on match-fixer Eric Ding who had bribed three Lebanese FIFA football officials with prostitutes as an inducement to fix future matches that they would officiate, as well as perverting the course of justice.\nIndictments and arrests.\nFourteen FIFA officials and marketing executives were indicted by the United States Department of Justice in May 2015. The officials were arrested in Switzerland and are in the process of extradition to the US. Specific charges (brought under the RICO act) include wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering.\n\"Swiss authorities say they have also opened a separate criminal investigation into FIFA's operations pertaining to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids\".\nFIFA's top officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on suspicion of receiving bribes totalling $100m (\u00a365m). The US Department of Justice stated that nine FIFA officials and four executives of sports management companies were arrested and accused of over $150m in bribes. The UK Shadow Home Secretary and Labour Member of Parliament, Andy Burnham, stated in May 2015 that England should boycott the 2018 World Cup against corruption in FIFA and military aggression by Russia.\n2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.\nFIFA's choice to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has been widely criticized by media. It has been alleged that some FIFA inside sources insist that the Russian kickbacks of cash and gifts given to FIFA executive members were enough to secure the Russian 2018 bid weeks before the result was announced. Sepp Blatter was widely criticized in the media for giving a warning about the \"evils of the media\" in a speech to FIFA executive committee members shortly before they voted on the hosting of the 2018 World Cup, a reference to \"The Sunday Times\" expos\u00e9s, and the \"Panorama\" investigation.\nTwo members of FIFA's executive committee were banned from all football-related activity in November 2010 for allegedly offering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. In early May 2011, a British parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure the 2018 finals was told by member of parliament, Damian Collins, that there was evidence from \"The Sunday Times\" newspaper that Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Jacques Anouma of Ivory Coast were paid by Qatar. Qatar has categorically denied the allegations, as have Hayatou and Anouma.\nFIFA president Blatter said, , that the British newspaper \"The Sunday Times\" has agreed to bring its whistle-blowing source to meet senior FIFA officials, who will decide whether to order a new investigation into alleged World Cup bidding corruption. \"[The \"Sunday Times\"] are happy, they agreed that they will bring this whistleblower here to Z\u00fcrich and then we will have a discussion, an investigation of this\", Blatter said.\nSpecifically, the whistle-blower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were paid $1.5\u00a0million to vote for Qatar. The emirate's bid beat the United States in a final round of voting last December. Blatter did not rule out reopening the 2022 vote if corruption could be proved, but urged taking the matter \"step by step\". The FIFA president said his organization is \"anxiously awaiting\" more evidence before asking its ethics committee to examine allegations made in Britain's Parliament in early May 2011.\nHayatou, who is from Cameroon, leads the Confederation of African Football and is a FIFA vice president. Anouma is president of Ivorian Football Federation. The whistle-blower said Qatar agreed to pay a third African voter, Amos Adamu, for his support. The Nigerian was later suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court ruled he solicited bribes from undercover Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said the newspaper and its whistle-blower would meet with FIFA secretary general, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, and legal director, Marco Villiger.\nAllegations against FIFA officials have also been made to the UK Parliament by David Triesman, the former head of England's bid and the English Football Association. Triesman told the lawmakers that four long-standing FIFA executive committee members\u2014Jack Warner, Nicol\u00e1s Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi\u2014engaged in \"improper and unethical\" conduct in the 2018 bidding, which was won by Russia. All six FIFA voters have denied wrongdoing.\nOn 28 September 2015, Sepp Blatter suggested that the 2018 World Cup being awarded to Russia was planned before the voting, and that the 2022 World Cup would have then been awarded to the United States. However, this plan changed after the election ballot, and the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar instead of the U.S.\nAccording to leaked documents seen by \"The Sunday Times\", Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400\u00a0million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state-run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100\u00a0million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480\u00a0million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880\u00a0million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 world cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police. FIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to \"The Sunday Times\" in an email and wrote \"allegations linked to the Fifa World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by Fifa, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com. Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending. Fifa is and will continue to cooperate with the authorities\". Damian Collins called for payments from Al Jazeera to be frozen and launch an investigation into the apparent contract since the contract \"appears to be in clear breach of the rules\".\n2011 FIFA presidential election.\nFIFA announced on 25 May 2011 that it had opened the investigation to examine the conduct of four officials\u2014Mohamed Bin Hammam and Jack Warner, along with Caribbean Football Union (CFU) officials Debbie Minguell and Jason Sylvester\u2014in relation to claims made by executive committee member, Chuck Blazer. Blazer, who was at the time, the general secretary of the CONCACAF confederation, has alleged that violations were committed under the FIFA code of ethics during a meeting organized by Bin Hammam and Warner on 10 and 11 May\u2014the same time Lord Triesman had accused Warner of demanding money for a World Cup 2018 vote\u2014in relation to the 2011 FIFA presidential election, in which Bin Hammam, who also played a key role in the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, allegedly offered financial incentives for votes cast in his favour during the presidential election. As a result of the investigation both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended. Warner reacted to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, had told him via e-mail that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup. Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had \"used its financial muscle to lobby for support\". Qatar officials denied any impropriety. Bin Hammam also responded by writing to FIFA, protesting unfair treatment in suspension by the FIFA Ethics Committee and FIFA administration.\nFurther evidence emerged of alleged corruption. On 30 May 2011, Fred Lunn, vice-president of the Bahamas Football Association, said that he was given $40,000 in cash as an incitement to vote for FIFA presidential candidate, Mohamed bin Hammam. In addition, on 11 June 2011 Louis Giskus, president of the Surinamese Football Association, alleged that he was given $40,000 in cash for \"development projects\" as an incentive to vote for Bin Hammam.\nResponse to allegations.\nAfter being re-elected as president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter responded to the allegations by promising to reform FIFA in wake of the bribery scandal, with Danny Jordaan, CEO of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, saying there is great expectation for reform. Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is being tipped for a role on the newly proposed 'Solutions Committee', and former Netherlands national football team player Johan Cruyff was also being linked with a role.\nUEFA secretary general Gianni Infantino said he hopes for \"concrete\" measures to be taken by the world game's authority. Saying that \"the UEFA executive committee has taken note of the will of FIFA to take concrete and effective measures for good governance ... [and is] following the situation closely.\"\nIOC president Jacques Rogge commented on the situation by saying that he believes FIFA \"can emerge stronger\" from its worst-ever crisis, stating that \"I will not point a finger and lecture ... I am sure FIFA can emerge stronger and from within\".\nSeveral of FIFA's partners and sponsors have raised concerns about the allegations of corruption, including Coca-Cola, Adidas, Emirates and Visa. Coca-Cola raised concerns by saying \"the current allegations being raised are distressing and bad for the sport\"; with Adidas saying \"the negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners\"; moreover Emirates raised its concerns by saying \"we hope that these issues will be resolved as soon as possible\"; and Visa adding \"the current situation is clearly not good for the game and we ask that Fifa take all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been raised.\"\nAustralian Sports Minister Mark Arbib said it was clear FIFA needed to change, saying \"there is no doubt there needs to be reform of FIFA. This is something that we're hearing worldwide\", with Australian Senator Nick Xenophon accusing FIFA of \"scamming\" the country out of the A$46\u00a0million (US$35\u00a0million) it spent on the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, saying that \"until the investigation into FIFA has been completed, Australia must hold off spending any more taxpayers' money on any future World Cup bids.\"\nTheo Zwanziger, president of the German Football Association, also called on FIFA to re-examine the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.\nTransparency International, which had called on FIFA to postpone the election pending a full independent investigation, renewed its call on FIFA to change its governance structure.\nMoreover, former Argentine football player Diego Maradona was critical of FIFA in light of the corruption scandal, comparing members of the board to dinosaurs. He said \"Fifa is a big museum. They are dinosaurs who do not want to relinquish power. It's always going to be the same.\" In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, \"FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing to be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its conduct in the future will be such that the public can be confident in the governance of the sport.\"\n2018 revision of code of ethics.\nIn 2018, FIFA revised its code of ethics to remove corruption as one of the enumerated bases of ethical violations. It retained bribery, misappropriation of funds and manipulation of competitions as offences, but added a statute of limitation clause that those offences could not be pursued after a ten-year period.\nThe revision also made it an offence to make public statements of a defamatory nature against FIFA. Alexandra Wrage, a former member of the FIFA governance committee and an expert in anti-bribery compliance, said that of the revision that \"the real value to FIFA is the chilling effect this will have on critics\"."}

{"id": "11054", "revid": "2278355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11054", "title": "Fascism", "text": "Fascism () is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War\u00a0I, before spreading to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, democracy, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is placed on the far right within the traditional left\u2013right spectrum.\nFascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A \"military citizenship\" arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war. The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.\nFascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. A fascist state is led by a strong leader such as a dictator and a martial law government composed of the members of the governing fascist party to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views imperialism, political violence and war as means that can achieve national rejuvenation. Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky (national economic self-sufficiency) through protectionist and economic interventionist policies. The extreme authoritarianism and nationalism of fascism often manifests a belief in racial \"purity\" or a \"master race\", usually synthesized with some variant of racism or bigotry of a demonized other; the idea of \"purity\" has motivated fascist regimes to commit massacres, forced sterilizations, genocides, mass killings or forced deportations against a perceived other.\nSince the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist, and the term is instead now usually used [[Fascist (insult)|pejoratively]] by political opponents. The descriptions [[neo-fascist]] or post-fascist are sometimes applied more formally to describe contemporary parties of the far-right with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements.\nEtymology.\nThe Italian term \"fascismo\" is derived from \"fascio\" meaning \"a bundle of sticks\", ultimately from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word \"[[fasces]]\". This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as [[fasci]], groups similar to [[guild]]s or [[syndicate]]s. According to Italian fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s own account, the [[Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria|Fasces of Revolutionary Action]] were founded in Italy in 1915. In 1919, Mussolini founded the [[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento|Italian Fasces of Combat]] in Milan, which became the [[National Fascist Party]] two years later. The Fascists came to associate the term with the ancient Roman fasces or \"[[fascio littorio]]\"\u2014a bundle of rods tied around an axe, an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbol of the authority of the civic [[Roman Magistrates|magistrate]] carried by his [[lictor]]s, which could be used for [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] and [[capital punishment]] at his command.\nThe symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break. Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements: for example, the [[Falange]] symbol is five arrows joined together by a yoke.\nDefinitions.\nHistorians, political scientists, and other scholars have long debated the exact nature of fascism. Indeed, historian [[Ian Kershaw]] once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall\". Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow.\nAccording to many scholars, fascism \u2013 especially once in power \u2013 has historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far right.\nOne common definition of the term, frequently cited by reliable sources as a standard definition, is that of historian [[Stanley G. Payne]]. He focuses on three concepts:\nProfessor [[Jason Stanley]], in his book \"[[How Fascism Works|How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them]]\", observed that \"The leader proposes that only he can solve it and all of his political opponents are enemies or traitors.\" Stanley says recent global events , including the [[COVID-19 pandemic|pandemic]] and the [[2020\u20132021 United States racial unrest|protests]], have substantiated his concern about how fascist rhetoric is showing up in politics and policies around the world.\nHistorian [[John Lukacs]] argues that there is no such thing as generic fascism. He claims that [[Nazism]] and [[communism]] are essentially manifestations of [[populism]] and that states such as Nazi Germany and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] are more different than similar.\n[[Roger Griffin]] describes fascism as \"a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a [[palingenesis|palingenetic]] form of populist [[ultranationalism]]\". Griffin describes the ideology as having three core components: \"(i) the rebirth myth, (ii) populist ultra-nationalism, and (iii) the myth of decadence\". In Griffin's view, fascism is \"a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-liberal, and in the last analysis, anti-conservative nationalism\" built on a complex range of theoretical and cultural influences. He distinguishes an inter-war period in which it manifested itself in elite-led but populist \"armed party\" politics opposing socialism and liberalism and promising radical politics to rescue the nation from decadence. In \"Against the Fascist Creep\", [[Alexander Reid Ross]] writes regarding Griffin's view:\nFollowing the [[Cold War]] and shifts in fascist organizing techniques, a number of scholars have moved toward the minimalist \"new consensus\" refined by Roger Griffin: \"the mythic core\" of fascism is \"a populist form of [[palingenetic ultranationalism]].\" That means that fascism is an ideology that draws on old, ancient, and even arcane myths of racial, cultural, ethnic, and national origins to develop a plan for the \"new man.\"\nIndeed, Griffin himself explored this 'mythic' or 'eliminable' core of fascism with his concept of \"post-fascism\" to explore the continuation of Nazism in the modern era. Additionally, other historians have applied this minimalist core to explore \"proto-fascist\" movements.\n[[Cas Mudde]] and Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser argue that although fascism \"flirted with populism ... in an attempt to generate mass support\", it is better seen as an elitist ideology. They cite in particular its exaltation of the Leader, the race, and the state, rather than the people. They see populism as a \"thin-centered ideology\" with a \"restricted morphology\" which necessarily becomes attached to \"thick-centered\" ideologies such as fascism, liberalism, or socialism. Thus populism can be found as an aspect of many specific ideologies, without necessarily being a defining characteristic of those ideologies. They refer to the combination of populism, authoritarianism and ultranationalism as \"a marriage of convenience.\"\n[[Robert Paxton]] says that:\n[[Roger Eatwell]] defines fascism as \"an ideology that strives to forge social rebirth based on a [[Holism|holistic]]-national radical [[Third Way]]\", while [[Walter Laqueur]] sees the core tenets of fascism as \"self-evident: nationalism; [[Social Darwinism]]; racialism, the need for leadership, a new aristocracy, and obedience; and the negation of the ideals of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution.\"\nRacism was a key feature of German fascism, for which the [[Holocaust]] was a high priority. According to the historiography of [[genocide]], \"In dealing with the Holocaust, it is the consensus of historians that Nazi Germany targeted Jews as a race, not as a religious group.\" [[Umberto Eco]], Kevin Passmore, John Weiss, Ian Adams, and Moyra Grant stress [[racism]] as a characteristic component of German fascism. Historian [[Robert Soucy]] stated that \"Hitler envisioned the ideal German society as a \"[[Volksgemeinschaft]]\", a racially unified and hierarchically organized body in which the interests of individuals would be strictly subordinate to those of the nation, or Volk.\" Fascist philosophies vary by application, but remain distinct by one theoretical commonality: all traditionally fall into the far-right sector of any [[political spectrum]], catalyzed by afflicted class identities over conventional social inequities.\nPosition in the political spectrum.\nMost scholars place fascism on the far right of the political spectrum. Such scholarship focuses on its [[social conservatism]] and its authoritarian means of opposing [[egalitarianism]]. Roderick Stackelberg places fascism\u2014including Nazism, which he says is \"a radical variant of fascism\"\u2014on the political right by explaining: \"The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum. The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be\".\nFascism's origins, however, are complex and include many seemingly contradictory viewpoints, ultimately centered around a mythos of national rebirth from decadence. Fascism was founded during [[World War I]] by Italian [[National syndicalism|national syndicalists]] who drew upon both [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] organizational tactics and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] political views.\n[[Italian Fascism]] gravitated to the right in the early 1920s. A major element of fascist ideology that has been deemed to be far-right is its stated goal to promote the right of a supposedly superior people to dominate, while purging society of supposedly inferior elements.\nIn the 1920s, the Italian Fascists described their ideology as right-wing in the political program \"[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]\", stating: \"We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right,' a fascist century\". Mussolini stated that fascism's position on the political spectrum was not a serious issue for fascists: \"Fascism, sitting on the right, could also have sat on the mountain of the center\u00a0... These words in any case do not have a fixed and unchanged meaning: they do have a variable subject to location, time and spirit. We don't give a damn about these empty terminologies and we despise those who are terrorized by these words\".\nMajor Italian groups politically on the right, especially rich landowners and big business, feared an uprising by groups on the left such as sharecroppers and labour unions. They welcomed Fascism and supported its violent suppression of opponents on the left. The accommodation of the political right into the Italian Fascist movement in the early 1920s created internal factions within the movement. The \"Fascist left\" included [[Michele Bianchi]], [[Giuseppe Bottai]], [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]], [[Sergio Panunzio]], and [[Edmondo Rossoni]], who were committed to advancing national syndicalism as a replacement for parliamentary liberalism in order to modernize the economy and advance the interests of workers and the common people. The \"Fascist right\" included members of the paramilitary \"Squadristi\" and former members of the [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI). The \"Squadristi\" wanted to establish Fascism as a complete dictatorship, while the former ANI members, including [[Alfredo Rocco]], sought to institute an authoritarian corporatist state to replace the liberal state in Italy while retaining the existing elites. Upon accommodating the political right, there arose a group of monarchist fascists who sought to use fascism to create an [[absolute monarchy]] under King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]].\nAfter the [[fall of the Fascist regime in Italy]], when King Victor Emmanuel III forced Mussolini to resign as head of government and placed him under arrest in 1943, Mussolini was rescued by German forces. While continuing to rely on Germany for support, Mussolini and the remaining loyal Fascists founded the [[Italian Social Republic]] with Mussolini as head of state. Mussolini sought to re-radicalize Italian Fascism, declaring that the Fascist state had been overthrown because Italian Fascism had been subverted by Italian conservatives and the bourgeoisie. Then the new Fascist government proposed the creation of workers' councils and profit-sharing in industry, although the German authorities, who effectively controlled northern Italy at this point, ignored these measures and did not seek to enforce them.\nA number of post-World War II fascist movements described themselves as a \"[[Third Position|third position]]\" outside the traditional political spectrum. Spanish [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS|Falangist]] leader [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]] said: \"[B]asically the Right stands for the maintenance of an economic structure, albeit an unjust one, while the Left stands for the attempt to subvert that economic structure, even though the subversion thereof would entail the destruction of much that was worthwhile\".\n\"Fascist\" as a pejorative.\nThe term \"fascist\" has been used as a [[pejorative]], regarding varying movements across the far right of the political spectrum. [[George Orwell]] wrote in 1944 that \"the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless\u00a0... almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist.\nDespite fascist movements' history of anti-communism, [[communist state]]s have sometimes been referred to as \"fascist\", typically as an insult. For example, it has been applied to [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] regimes in [[Cuba]] under [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Vietnam]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]]. Chinese Marxists used the term to denounce the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Sino-Soviet Split]], and likewise the Soviets used the term to denounce Chinese Marxists and [[social democracy]] (coining a new term in \"[[social fascism]]\").\nIn the [[United States]], Herbert Matthews of \"[[The New York Times]]\" asked in 1946: \"Should we now place Stalinist Russia in the same category as Hitlerite Germany? Should we say that she is Fascist?\". [[J. Edgar Hoover]], longtime [[FBI]] director and ardent anti-communist, wrote extensively of \"Red Fascism\". The [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the 1920s was sometimes called \"fascist\". Historian Peter Amann states that, \"Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism\u2014chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism\u2014yet their differences were fundamental ... [the KKK] never envisioned a change of political or economic system.\"\nProfessor Richard Griffiths of the [[University of Wales]] wrote in 2005 that \"fascism\" is the \"most misused, and over-used word, of our times\". \"Fascist\" is sometimes applied to post-World War II organizations and ways of thinking that academics more commonly term \"[[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]]\".\nHistory.\n19th-century roots.\n[[Georges Valois]], founder of the first non-Italian fascist party [[Faisceau]], claimed the roots of fascism stemmed from the late 18th century [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] movement, seeing in its totalitarian nature a foreshadowing of the fascist state. Historian [[George Mosse]] similarly analyzed fascism as an inheritor of the [[Mass movement|mass ideology]] and [[civil religion]] of the [[French Revolution]], as well as a result of the brutalization of societies in 1914\u20131918.\nHistorians such as [[Irene Collins]] and [[Howard C Payne]] see [[Napoleon III]], who ran a 'police state' and suppressed the media, as a forerunner of fascism. According to [[David Thomson (historian)|David Thomson]], the Italian [[Risorgimento]] of 1871 led to the 'nemesis of fascism'. [[William L Shirer]] sees a continuity from the views of [[Fichte]] and [[Hegel]], through [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], to Hitler; [[Robert Gerwarth]] speaks of a 'direct line' from Bismarck to Hitler. [[Julian Dierkes]] sees fascism as a 'particularly violent form of [[imperialism]]'.\n\"Fin de si\u00e8cle\" era and the fusion of Maurrasism with Sorelianism (1880\u20131914).\nThe historian [[Zeev Sternhell]] has traced the ideological roots of fascism back to the 1880s and in particular to the \"[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]\" theme of that time. The theme was based on a revolt against [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[positivism]], bourgeois society and [[democracy]]. The \"fin-de-si\u00e8cle\" generation supported [[emotionalism (disorder)|emotionalism]], [[irrationalism]], [[subjectivism]] and [[vitalism]]. They regarded civilization as being in crisis, requiring a massive and total solution. Their intellectual school considered the individual as only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as a numerical sum of atomized individuals. They condemned the rationalistic individualism of liberal society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society.\nThe \"fin-de-si\u00e8cle\" outlook was influenced by various intellectual developments, including [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] [[biology]]; [[Gesamtkunstwerk|Wagnerian aesthetics]]; [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s racialism; [[Gustave Le Bon]]'s [[psychology]]; and the philosophies of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Henri Bergson]]. Social Darwinism, which gained widespread acceptance, made no distinction between physical and social life, and viewed the human condition as being an unceasing struggle to achieve the [[survival of the fittest]]. Social Darwinism challenged positivism's claim of deliberate and rational choice as the determining behaviour of humans, with social Darwinism focusing on heredity, race, and environment. Social Darwinism's emphasis on biogroup identity and the role of organic relations within societies fostered the legitimacy and appeal of nationalism. New theories of social and political psychology also rejected the notion of human behaviour being governed by rational choice and instead claimed that emotion was more influential in political issues than reason. Nietzsche's argument that \"God is dead\" coincided with his attack on the \"herd mentality\" of [[Christianity]], democracy and modern collectivism; his concept of the \"[[\u00fcbermensch]]\"; and his advocacy of the [[will to power]] as a primordial instinct, were major influences upon many of the \"fin-de-si\u00e8cle\" generation. Bergson's claim of the existence of an \"\u00e9lan vital\" or vital instinct centred upon free choice and rejected the processes of materialism and determinism; this challenged Marxism.\n[[Gaetano Mosca]] in his work \"The Ruling Class\" (1896) developed the theory that claims that in all societies an \"organized minority\" will dominate and rule over the \"disorganized majority\". Mosca claims that there are only two classes in society, \"the governing\" (the organized minority) and \"the governed\" (the disorganized majority). He claims that the organized nature of the organized minority makes it irresistible to any individual of the disorganized majority.\n[[French nationalism|French nationalist]] and reactionary monarchist [[Charles Maurras]] influenced fascism. Maurras promoted what he called [[integral nationalism]], which called for the organic unity of a nation, and insisted that a powerful monarch was an ideal leader of a nation. Maurras distrusted what he considered the democratic mystification of the popular will that created an impersonal collective subject. He claimed that a powerful monarch was a personified sovereign who could exercise authority to unite a nation's people. Maurras' integral nationalism was idealized by fascists, but modified into a modernized revolutionary form that was devoid of Maurras' monarchism.\nFrench revolutionary syndicalist [[Georges Sorel]] promoted the legitimacy of [[political violence]] in his work \"[[Reflections on Violence]]\" (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a [[general strike]]. In \"Reflections on Violence\", Sorel emphasized need for a revolutionary [[political religion]]. Also in his work \"The Illusions of Progress\", Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying \"nothing is more aristocratic than democracy\". By 1909 after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views\u2014advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries. Initially Sorel had officially been a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] of Marxism, but by 1910 announced his abandonment of socialist literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of [[Benedetto Croce]] that \"socialism is dead\" because of the \"decomposition of Marxism\". Sorel became a supporter of reactionary Maurrassian nationalism beginning in 1909 that influenced his works. Maurras held interest in merging his nationalist ideals with [[Sorelianism|Sorelian]] [[syndicalism]] as a means to confront democracy. Maurras stated \"a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand\".\n[[File:EnricoCorradini.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Enrico Corradini]] ]]\nThe fusion of Maurrassian nationalism and Sorelian syndicalism influenced radical Italian nationalist [[Enrico Corradini]]. Corradini spoke of the need for a nationalist-syndicalist movement, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action and a willingness to fight. Corradini spoke of Italy as being a \"proletarian nation\" that needed to pursue imperialism in order to challenge the \"[[Plutocracy|plutocratic]]\" French and British. Corradini's views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing Italian Nationalist Association (ANI), which claimed that Italy's economic backwardness was caused by:\nThe ANI held ties and influence among [[Conservatism|conservatives]], Catholics and the business community. Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of [[bourgeois]] values, democracy, liberalism, [[Marxism]], [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and [[pacifism]]; and the promotion of [[heroism]], vitalism and violence.\nThe ANI claimed that liberal democracy was no longer compatible with the modern world, and advocated a strong state and imperialism. They believed that humans are naturally predatory, and that nations are in a constant struggle in which only the strongest would survive.\n[[File:Manifesto of Futurism.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], Italian modernist author of the \"[[Futurist Manifesto]]\" (1909) and later the co-author of the \"[[Fascist Manifesto]]\" (1919)]]\nFuturism was both an artistic-cultural movement and initially a political movement in Italy led by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] who founded the \"[[Futurist Manifesto]]\" (1908), that championed the causes of modernism, action, and political violence as necessary elements of politics while denouncing liberalism and parliamentary politics. Marinetti rejected conventional democracy based on majority rule and egalitarianism, for a new form of democracy, promoting what he described in his work \"The Futurist Conception of Democracy\" as the following:\nFuturism influenced fascism in its emphasis on recognizing the virile nature of violent action and war as being necessities of modern civilization. Marinetti promoted the need of physical training of young men saying that, in male education, gymnastics should take precedence over books. He advocated segregation of the genders because womanly sensibility must not enter men's education, which he claimed must be \"lively, bellicose, muscular and violently dynamic\".\n[[File:Benito Mussolini 1917.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Benito Mussolini]] (here in 1917 as a soldier in [[World War I]]), who in 1914 founded and led the \"[[Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria]]\" to promote the Italian intervention in the war as a [[Revolutionary Nationalism|revolutionary nationalist]] action to liberate Italian-claimed lands from Austria-Hungary]]\nWorld War I and its aftermath (1914\u20131929).\nAt the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI) opposed the war but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their reactionary regimes had to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism. Angelo Oliviero Olivetti formed a pro-interventionist [[fascio]] called the [[Fascio Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista|Revolutionary Fasces of International Action]] in October 1914. Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI's newspaper \"[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]\" for his anti-German stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate fascio. The term \"Fascism\" was first used in 1915 by members of Mussolini's movement, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action.\nThe first meeting of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action was held on 24 January 1915 when Mussolini declared that it was necessary for Europe to resolve its national problems\u2014including national borders\u2014of Italy and elsewhere \"for the ideals of justice and liberty for which oppressed peoples must acquire the right to belong to those national communities from which they descended\". Attempts to hold mass meetings were ineffective and the organization was regularly harassed by government authorities and socialists.\n[[File:IR L\u00fcbeck 033 - EB.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|German soldiers parading through L\u00fcbeck in the days leading up to World War I. [[Johann Plenge]]'s concept of the \"[[Spirit of 1914]]\" identified the outbreak of war as a moment that forged nationalistic German solidarity.]]\nSimilar political ideas arose in Germany after the outbreak of the war. German sociologist [[Johann Plenge]] spoke of the rise of a \"National Socialism\" in Germany within what he termed the \"ideas of 1914\" that were a declaration of war against the \"ideas of 1789\" (the French Revolution). According to Plenge, the \"ideas of 1789\"\u2014such as the rights of man, democracy, individualism and liberalism\u2014were being rejected in favor of \"the ideas of 1914\" that included \"German values\" of duty, discipline, law and order. Plenge believed that racial solidarity (\"Volksgemeinschaft\") would replace class division and that \"racial comrades\" would unite to create a socialist society in the struggle of \"proletarian\" Germany against \"capitalist\" Britain. He believed that the \"[[Spirit of 1914]]\" manifested itself in the concept of the \"People's League of National Socialism\". This National Socialism was a form of state socialism that rejected the \"idea of boundless freedom\" and promoted an economy that would serve the whole of Germany under the leadership of the state. This National Socialism was opposed to capitalism because of the components that were against \"the national interest\" of Germany but insisted that National Socialism would strive for greater efficiency in the economy. Plenge advocated an authoritarian rational ruling elite to develop National Socialism through a hierarchical [[Technocracy|technocratic]] state.\nImpact of World War I.\nFascists viewed World War I as bringing revolutionary changes in the nature of war, society, the state and technology, as the advent of [[total war]] and mass mobilization had broken down the distinction between civilian and combatant, as civilians had become a critical part in economic production for the war effort and thus arose a \"military citizenship\" in which all citizens were involved to the military in some manner during the war. World War I had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines or provide economic production and logistics to support those on the front lines, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens. Fascists viewed technological developments of weaponry and the state's total mobilization of its population in the war as symbolizing the beginning of a new era fusing state power with [[mass politics]], technology and particularly the mobilizing myth that they contended had triumphed over the myth of progress and the era of liberalism.\n[[File:Italian Arditi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Members of Italy's \"[[Arditi]]\" corps (here in 1918 holding daggers, a symbol of their group), which was formed in 1917 as groups of soldiers trained for dangerous missions, characterized by refusal to surrender and willingness to fight to the death. Their black uniforms inspired those of the Italian Fascist movement.]]\nImpact of the Bolshevik Revolution.\nThe [[October Revolution]] of 1917\u2014in which [[Bolshevik]] communists led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] seized power in Russia\u2014greatly influenced the development of fascism. In 1917, Mussolini, as leader of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action, praised the October Revolution, but later he became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him as merely a new version of Tsar Nicholas. After World War I, fascists commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas.\nLiberal opponents of both fascism and the Bolsheviks argue that there are various similarities between the two, including that they believed in the necessity of a vanguard leadership, had disdain for bourgeois values and it is argued had totalitarian ambitions. In practice, both have commonly emphasized revolutionary action, proletarian nation theories, one-party states and party-armies. However, both draw clear distinctions from each other both in aims and tactics, with the Bolsheviks emphasizing the need for an [[Soviet democracy|organized participatory democracy]] and an egalitarian, [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] vision for society while the fascists emphasize [[hyper-nationalism]] and open hostility towards democracy, envisioning a hierarchical social structure as essential to their aims.\nWith the antagonism between anti-interventionist Marxists and pro-interventionist Fascists complete by the end of the war, the two sides became irreconcilable. The Fascists presented themselves as [[Anti-communism|anti-Marxists]] and as opposed to the Marxists. Mussolini consolidated control over the Fascist movement, known as [[Sansepolcrismo]], in 1919 with the founding of the \"Italian Fasces of Combat\".\n\"Fascist Manifesto\" of 1919.\nIn 1919, [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti created \"[[Fascist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat]]\" (the \"Fascist Manifesto\"). The \"Manifesto\" was presented on 6 June 1919 in the Fascist newspaper \"Il Popolo d'Italia\". The \"Manifesto\" supported the creation of [[universal suffrage]] for both men [[women's suffrage|and women]] (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded); [[proportional representation]] on a regional basis; government representation through a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] system of \"National Councils\" of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, communications, etc.; and the abolition of the [[Italian Senate]]. The \"Manifesto\" supported the creation of an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for all workers, a [[minimum wage]], worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong [[progressive tax]] on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of profits. It also called for the fulfillment of expansionist aims in the Balkans and other parts of the Mediterranean, the creation of a short-service national militia to serve defensive duties, [[nationalization]] of the armaments industry and a foreign policy designed to be peaceful but also competitive.\n[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Residents of [[Rijeka|Fiume]] cheer the arrival of [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and his blackshirt-wearing nationalist raiders, as D'Annunzio and Fascist [[Alceste De Ambris]] developed the quasi-fascist [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]] (a city-state in Fiume) from 1919 to 1920 and whose actions by D'Annunzio in Fiume inspired the Italian Fascist movement.]]\nThe next events that influenced the Fascists in Italy was the raid of [[Fiume (city)|Fiume]] by Italian nationalist [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and the founding of the [[Charter of Carnaro]] in 1920. D'Annunzio and De Ambris designed the Charter, which advocated national-syndicalist corporatist [[productionism]] alongside D'Annunzio's political views. Many Fascists saw the Charter of Carnaro as an ideal constitution for a Fascist Italy. This behaviour of aggression towards Yugoslavia and [[South Slavs]] was pursued by Italian Fascists with their persecution of South Slavs\u2014especially Slovenes and Croats.\nItalian Fascists in 1920.\nIn 1920, militant strike activity by industrial workers reached its peak in Italy and 1919 and 1920 were known as the [[Biennio Rosso|\"Red Years\"]]. Mussolini and the Fascists took advantage of the situation by allying with industrial businesses and attacking workers and peasants in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy.\nFascists identified their primary opponents as the majority of socialists on the left who had opposed intervention in World War I. The Fascists and the Italian political right held common ground: both held Marxism in contempt, discounted class consciousness and believed in the rule of elites. The Fascists assisted the anti-socialist campaign by allying with the other parties and the conservative right in a mutual effort to destroy the Italian Socialist Party and labour organizations committed to class identity above national identity.\nFascism sought to accommodate Italian conservatives by making major alterations to its political agenda\u2014abandoning its previous populism, [[republicanism]] and [[anticlericalism]], adopting policies in support of [[free enterprise]] and accepting the [[Catholic Church]] and the monarchy as institutions in Italy. To appeal to Italian conservatives, Fascism adopted policies such as promoting family values, including policies designed to reduce the number of women in the workforce\u2014limiting the woman's role to that of a mother. The fascists banned literature on birth control and increased penalties for abortion in 1926, declaring both crimes against the state.\nThough Fascism adopted a number of anti-modern positions designed to appeal to people upset with the new trends in sexuality and women's rights\u2014especially those with a [[reactionary]] point of view\u2014the Fascists sought to maintain Fascism's revolutionary character, with Angelo Oliviero Olivetti saying: \"Fascism would like to be conservative, but it will [be] by being revolutionary\". The Fascists supported revolutionary action and committed to secure law and order to appeal to both conservatives and syndicalists.\nPrior to Fascism's accommodations to the political right, Fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members. After Fascism's accommodation of the political right, the Fascist movement's membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921.\nFascist violence in 1922.\nBeginning in 1922, Fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and the homes of socialist leadership figures, to one of violent occupation of cities. The Fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities. The Fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and Catholic labour unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Trent and Bolzano. After seizing these cities, the Fascists made plans to take [[Rome]].\n[[File:March on Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Benito Mussolini]] with three of the four [[quadrumvirs]] during the [[March on Rome]] (from left to right: unknown, [[Emilio de Bono|de Bono]], Mussolini, [[Italo Balbo|Balbo]] and [[Cesare Maria de Vecchi|de Vecchi]])]]\nOn 24 October 1922, the Fascist party held its annual congress in [[Naples]], where Mussolini ordered Blackshirts to take control of public buildings and trains and to converge on three points around Rome. The Fascists managed to seize control of several post offices and trains in northern Italy while the Italian government, led by a left-wing coalition, was internally divided and unable to respond to the Fascist advances. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy perceived the risk of bloodshed in Rome in response to attempting to disperse the Fascists to be too high. Victor Emmanuel III decided to appoint Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] and Mussolini arrived in Rome on 30 October to accept the appointment. Fascist propaganda aggrandized this event, known as \"[[March on Rome]]\", as a \"seizure\" of power because of Fascists' heroic exploits.\nFascist Italy.\nHistorian Stanley G. Payne says:\n[Fascism in Italy was a] primarily political dictatorship... The Fascist Party itself had become almost completely bureaucratized and subservient to, not dominant over, the state itself. Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy... The Fascist militia was placed under military control... The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders... nor was a major new police elite created... There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed... The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.\nMussolini in power.\nUpon being appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form a coalition government because the Fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament. Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] policies under the direction of liberal finance minister [[Alberto De Stefani]], a member of the Center Party, including balancing the budget through deep cuts to the civil service. Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited.\nThe Fascists began their attempt to entrench Fascism in Italy with the [[Acerbo Law]], which guaranteed a plurality of the seats in parliament to any party or coalition list in an election that received 25% or more of the vote. Through considerable Fascist violence and intimidation, the list won a majority of the vote, allowing many seats to go to the Fascists. In the aftermath of the election, a crisis and political scandal erupted after Socialist Party deputy [[Giacomo Matteotti]] was kidnapped and murdered by a Fascist. The liberals and the leftist minority in parliament walked out in protest in what became known as the [[Aventine Secession (20th century)|Aventine Secession]]. On 3 January 1925, Mussolini addressed the Fascist-dominated Italian parliament and declared that he was personally responsible for what happened, but insisted that he had done nothing wrong. Mussolini proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament. From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.\nCatholic Church.\nIn 1929, the Fascist regime briefly gained what was in effect a blessing of the Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the [[Lateran Treaty]], which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the nineteenth century, but within two years the Church had renounced Fascism in the Encyclical \"[[Non Abbiamo Bisogno]]\" as a \"pagan idolotry of the state\" which teaches \"hatred, violence and irreverence\". Not long after signing the agreement, by Mussolini's own confession, the Church had threatened to have him \"excommunicated\", in part because of his intractable nature, but also because he had \"confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years\u201d. By the late 1930s, Mussolini became more vocal in his anti-clerical rhetoric, repeatedly denouncing the Catholic Church and discussing ways to depose the pope. He took the position that the \u201cpapacy was a malignant tumor in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all,\u2019 because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and himself\". In her 1974 book, Mussolini's widow Rachele stated that her husband had always been an atheist until near the end of his life, writing that her husband was \"basically irreligious until the later years of his life\".\nThe Nazis in Germany employed similar anti-clerical policies. The Gestapo confiscated hundreds of monasteries in Austria and Germany, evicted clergymen and laymen alike and often replaced crosses with swastikas. Referring to the swastika as the \"Devil\u2019s Cross\", church leaders found their youth organizations banned, their meetings limited and various Catholic periodicals censored or banned. Government officials eventually found it necessary to place \"Nazis into editorial positions in the Catholic press\". Up to 2,720 clerics, mostly Catholics, were arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned inside of Germany's Dachau concentration camp, resulting in over 1,000 deaths.\nCorporatist economic system.\nThe Fascist regime created a corporatist economic system in 1925 with creation of [[Pact of the Vidoni Palace|the Palazzo Vidoni Pact]], in which the Italian employers' association [[Confindustria]] and Fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy's employers and employees, excluding non-Fascist trade unions. The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, banned workers' strikes and lock-outs and in 1927 created the [[Labour Charter of 1927|Charter of Labour]], which established workers' rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes. In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime, and the employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves, but instead by appointed Fascist party members.\nAggressive foreign policy.\nIn the 1920s, Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive foreign policy that included an attack on the Greek island of [[Corfu]], ambitions to expand Italian territory in the [[Balkans]], plans to wage war against [[Turkey]] and [[Yugoslavia]], attempts to bring Yugoslavia into civil war by supporting Croat and Macedonian separatists to legitimize Italian intervention and making [[Albania]] a \"[[de facto]]\" [[protectorate]] of Italy, which was achieved through diplomatic means by 1927. In response to revolt in the Italian colony of [[Libya]], Fascist Italy abandoned previous liberal-era colonial policy of cooperation with local leaders. Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the \"inferior\" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya. This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the [[Pacification of Libya]] against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of [[concentration camp]]s and the forced starvation of thousands of people. Italian authorities committed [[ethnic cleansing]] by forcibly expelling 100,000 [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers.\nHitler adopts Italian model.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, M\u00fcnchen, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Nazis in Munich during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] ]]\nThe March on Rome brought Fascism international attention. One early admirer of the Italian Fascists was [[Adolf Hitler]], who less than a month after the March had begun to model himself and the [[Nazi Party]] upon Mussolini and the Fascists. The Nazis, led by Hitler and the German war hero [[Erich Ludendorff]], attempted a \"March on Berlin\" modeled upon the March on Rome, which resulted in the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]] in November 1923.\nInternational impact of the Great Depression and the buildup to World War II.\n[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benito Mussolini]] (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] (right)]]\nThe conditions of economic hardship caused by the [[Great Depression]] brought about an international surge of social unrest. According to historian Philip Morgan, \"the onset of the Great Depression \u2026 was the greatest stimulus yet to the diffusion and expansion of fascism outside Italy\". Fascist propaganda blamed the problems of the long depression of the 1930s on minorities and [[scapegoat]]s: \"[[anti-semitism|Judeo]]-[[Freemasonry|Masonic]]-[[Bolshevism|bolshevik]]\" conspiracies, [[Left-wing politics#Nationalism, anti-imperialism and anti-nationalism|left-wing internationalism]] and the presence of [[immigrant]]s.\nIn Germany, it contributed to the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]], which resulted in the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the establishment of the fascist regime, [[Nazi Germany]], under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, [[liberal democracy]] was dissolved in Germany and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s, the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]] and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups.\nFascist movements grew in strength elsewhere in Europe. Hungarian fascist [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] rose to power as Prime Minister of [[Hungary]] in 1932 and attempted to entrench his [[Party of Hungarian Life|Party of National Unity]] throughout the country. He created an eight-hour work day and a forty-eight-hour work week in industry; sought to entrench a corporatist economy; and pursued irredentist claims on Hungary's neighbors. The fascist [[Iron Guard]] movement in [[Romania]] soared in political support after 1933, gaining representation in the Romanian government, and an Iron Guard member assassinated Romanian prime minister [[Ion Duca]]. During the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], [[France]] faced the greatest domestic political turmoil since the [[Dreyfus Affair]] when the fascist [[Mouvement Franciste|Francist Movement]] and multiple far-right movements rioted \"[[en masse]]\" in Paris against the French government resulting in major political violence. A variety of para-fascist governments that borrowed elements from fascism were formed during the Great Depression, including those of [[Greece]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] and Yugoslavia.\n[[File:SaudacaoIntegralista1935.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brazilian Integralism|Integralists]] marching in Brazil]]\nIn the Americas, the [[Brazilian Integralism|Brazilian Integralists]] led by [[Pl\u00ednio Salgado]] claimed as many as 200,000 members although following coup attempts it faced a crackdown from the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] in 1937. In the 1930s, the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] gained seats in [[Chile]]'s parliament and attempted a coup d'\u00e9tat that resulted in the [[Seguro Obrero massacre]] of 1938.\nDuring the Great Depression, Mussolini promoted active state intervention in the economy. He denounced the contemporary \"[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]\" that he claimed began in 1914 as a failure because of its alleged [[decadence]], its support for unlimited [[consumerism]] and its intention to create the \"standardization of humankind\". Fascist Italy created the [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale|Institute for Industrial Reconstruction]] (IRI), a giant state-owned firm and holding company that provided state funding to failing private enterprises. The IRI was made a permanent institution in Fascist Italy in 1937, pursued Fascist policies to create national [[autarky]] and had the power to take over private firms to maximize war production. While Hitler's regime only nationalized 500 companies in key industries by the early 1940s, Mussolini declared in 1934 that \"[t]hree-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state\". Due to the worldwide depression, Mussolini's government was able to take over most of Italy's largest failing banks, who held controlling interest in many Italian businesses. The Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, a state-operated holding company in charge of bankrupt banks and companies, reported in early 1934 that they held assets of \"48.5 percent of the share capital of Italy\", which later included the capital of the banks themselves. Political historian Martin Blinkhorn estimated Italy's scope of state intervention and ownership \"greatly surpassed that in Nazi Germany, giving Italy a public sector second only to that of Stalin\u2019s Russia\". In the late 1930s, Italy enacted manufacturing cartels, tariff barriers, currency restrictions and massive regulation of the economy to attempt to balance payments. Italy's policy of autarky failed to achieve effective economic autonomy. Nazi Germany similarly pursued an economic agenda with the aims of autarky and rearmament and imposed [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policies, including forcing the German steel industry to use lower-quality German iron ore rather than superior-quality imported iron.\nWorld War II (1939\u20131945).\nIn Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, both Mussolini and Hitler pursued territorial expansionist and [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]] agendas from the 1930s through the 1940s culminating in World War II. Mussolini called for [[Irredentism|irredentist]] Italian claims to be reclaimed, establishing Italian domination of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and securing Italian access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the creation of Italian \"[[spazio vitale]]\" (\"vital space\") in the Mediterranean and [[Red Sea]] regions. Hitler called for irredentist German claims to be reclaimed along with the creation of German \"[[Lebensraum]]\" (\"living space\") in Eastern Europe, including territories held by the Soviet Union, that would be colonized by Germans.\n[[File:Inmate at the Rab concentration camp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emaciation|Emaciated]] male inmate at the Italian [[Rab concentration camp]] ]]\nFrom 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs. Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded Ethiopia in 1935]] resulting in its condemnation by the [[League of Nations]] and its widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the industrial Rhineland]], a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1938, Germany annexed [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on [[Czechoslovakia]] by arranging the [[Munich Agreement]] that gave Germany the [[Sudetenland]] and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Czechoslovakia was dissolved by the proclamation of the German client state of [[Slovak State|Slovakia]], followed by the next day of the occupation of the remaining [[Czech Lands]] and the proclamation of the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain. In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means. The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.\nThe invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse. Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in [[Egypt]] where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the [[Battle of Britain]]. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged\u2014contrary to Mussolini's plans\u2014resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance.\n[[File:Buchenwald Corpses 60623.jpg|thumb|right|Corpses of victims of the German [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] ]]\nDuring World War II, the Axis Powers in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Poles, Jews, Gypsies and others in the genocide known as the Holocaust.\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. In 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, the complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany, the Allied invasion of Italy and the corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini [[25 Luglio|was removed as head of government and arrested]] on the order of King Victor Emmanuel III, who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945.\nOn 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards, Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was [[denazification|systematically dismantled]] by the occupying Allied powers. An International Military Tribunal was subsequently convened in [[Nuremberg#Nazi era|Nuremberg]]. Beginning in November 1945 and lasting through 1949, numerous Nazi political, military and economic leaders were [[Nuremberg trials|tried and convicted]] of [[war crime]]s, with many of the worst offenders being sentenced to death and executed.\nPost-World War II (1945\u2013present).\n[[File:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Juan Per\u00f3n]], [[President of Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, admired [[Italian Fascism]] and modelled his economic policies on those pursued by Fascist Italy.]]\nThe victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in [[World War II]] led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe. The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.\n[[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Falangism|Falangist]] one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II and it survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco had [[Blue Division|sent volunteers]] to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. The first years were characterized by a repression against the anti-fascist ideologies, a deep censorship and the suppression of democratic institutions (elected Parliament, [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|Constitution of 1931]], Regional Statutes of Autonomy). After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with the Western powers during the Cold War, until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.\n[[File:Giorgio Almirante crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Giorgio Almirante]], leader of the [[Italian Social Movement]] from 1969 to 1987]]\nHistorian Robert Paxton observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that it was widely mimicked. Paxton says: \"In fascism's heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization\". He goes on to observe that Salazar \"crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization\". Paxton says that:\nHistorians tend to view the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] as [[para-fascism|para-fascist]] in nature, possessing minimal fascist tendencies.\n Other historians, including [[Fernando Rosas]] and Manuel Villaverde Cabral, think that the Estado Novo should be considered fascist. In Argentina, [[Peronism]], associated with the regime of [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was influenced by fascism. Between 1939 and 1941, prior to his rise to power, Per\u00f3n had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian Fascist policies.\nThe term neo-fascism refers to fascist movements after World War II. In Italy, the [[Italian Social Movement]] led by [[Giorgio Almirante]] was a major neo-fascist movement that transformed itself into a self-described \"post-fascist\" movement called the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), which has been an ally of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] for a decade. In 2008, AN joined Forza Italia in Berlusconi's new party [[The People of Freedom]], but in 2012 a group of politicians split from The People of Freedom, refounding the party with the name [[Brothers of Italy]]. In Germany, various neo-Nazi movements have been formed and banned in accordance with Germany's constitutional law which forbids Nazism. The [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD) is widely considered a neo-Nazi party, although the party does not publicly identify itself as such.\n[[File:Golden Dawn demonstration 1.jpg|thumb|right|Golden Dawn demonstration in Greece in 2012]]\nAfter the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in Greece's parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] and other Golden Dawn members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization.\nTenets.\n[[Robert O. Paxton]] finds that even though fascism \"maintained the existing regime of property and social hierarchy,\" it cannot be considered \"simply a more muscular form of conservatism,\" because \"fascism in power did carry out some changes profound enough to be called 'revolutionary'\". These transformations \"often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property.\" Paxton argues: [F]ascism redrew the frontiers between private and public, sharply diminishing what had once been untouchably private. It changed the practice of citizenship from the enjoyment of constitutional rights and duties to participation in mass ceremonies of affirmation and conformity. It reconfigured relations between the individual and the collectivity, so that an individual had no rights outside community interest. It expanded the powers of the executive\u2014party and state\u2014in a bid for total control. Finally, it unleashed aggressive emotions hitherto known in Europe only during war or social revolution.\nNationalism with or without expansionism.\nUltranationalism, combined with the myth of national rebirth, is a key foundation of fascism. Robert Paxton argues that \"a passionate nationalism\" is the basis of fascism, combined with \"a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history\" which holds that \"the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers\". Roger Griffin identifies the core of fascism as being palingenetic ultranationalism.\nThe fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people. Fascism seeks to solve economic, political and social problems by achieving a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] national rebirth, exalting the nation or [[race (biology)|race]] above all else and promoting cults of unity, strength and purity. European fascist movements typically espouse a racist conception of non-Europeans being inferior to Europeans. Beyond this, fascists in Europe have not held a unified set of racial views. Historically, most fascists promoted imperialism, although there have been several fascist movements that were uninterested in the pursuit of new imperial ambitions. For example, Nazism and Italian Fascism were [[expansionist]] and [[irredentist]]. Falangism in Spain envisioned the worldwide unification of Spanish-speaking peoples ([[Hispanidad]]). [[British Fascism]] was [[non-interventionist]], though it did embrace the British Empire.\nTotalitarianism.\nFascism promotes the establishment of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state. It opposes liberal democracy, rejects multi-party systems and may support a [[one-party state]] so that it may synthesize with the nation. Mussolini's \"The Doctrine of Fascism\" (1932) \u2013 partly [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]], who Mussolini described as \"the philosopher of Fascism\" \u2013 states:\nIn \"The Legal Basis of the Total State\", Nazi political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]] described the Nazi intention to form a \"strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity\" in order to avoid a \"disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart\".\nFascist states pursued policies of social [[indoctrination]] through [[propaganda]] in education and the media, and regulation of the production of educational and media materials. Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state.\nEconomy.\nFascism presented itself as an alternative to both [[Socialism|international socialism]] and [[Free market|free market capitalism]]. While fascism opposed mainstream socialism, it sometimes regarded itself as a type of nationalist \"socialism\" to highlight their commitment to national [[solidarity]] and unity. Fascists opposed international free market capitalism, but supported a type of productive capitalism. Economic self-sufficiency, known as autarky, was a major goal of most fascist governments.\nFascist governments advocated resolution of domestic [[class conflict]] within a nation in order to secure national solidarity. This would be done through the state mediating relations between the classes (contrary to the views of [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]]-inspired capitalists). While fascism was opposed to domestic class conflict, it was held that bourgeois-proletarian conflict existed primarily in national conflict between [[proletarian nation]]s versus [[bourgeois nation]]s. Fascism condemned what it viewed as widespread character traits that it associated as the typical bourgeois mentality that it opposed, such as: materialism, crassness, cowardice and the inability to comprehend the heroic ideal of the fascist \"warrior\"; and associations with liberalism, individualism and parliamentarianism. In 1918, Mussolini defined what he viewed as the proletarian character, defining proletarian as being one and the same with producers, a [[Productivism|productivist]] perspective that associated all people deemed productive, including entrepreneurs, technicians, workers and soldiers as being proletarian. He acknowledged the historical existence of both bourgeois and proletarian producers, but declared the need for bourgeois producers to merge with proletarian producers.\nWhile fascism denounced the mainstream internationalist and Marxist socialisms, it claimed to economically represent a type of nationalist productivist socialism that while condemning parasitical capitalism, it was willing to accommodate productivist capitalism within it. This was derived from [[Henri de Saint Simon]], whose ideas inspired the creation of [[utopian socialism]] and influenced other ideologies, that stressed solidarity rather than class war and whose conception of productive people in the economy included both productive workers and productive bosses to challenge the influence of the aristocracy and unproductive financial speculators. Saint Simon's vision combined the traditionalist right-wing criticisms of the French Revolution with a left-wing belief in the need for association or collaboration of productive people in society. Whereas Marxism condemned capitalism as a system of exploitative property relations, fascism saw the nature of the control of credit and money in the contemporary capitalist system as abusive. Unlike Marxism, fascism did not see class conflict between the Marxist-defined proletariat and the bourgeoisie as a given or as an engine of historical materialism. Instead, it viewed workers and productive capitalists in common as productive people who were in conflict with parasitic elements in society including: corrupt political parties, corrupt financial capital and feeble people. Fascist leaders such as Mussolini and Hitler spoke of the need to create a new managerial elite led by engineers and captains of industry\u2014but free from the parasitic leadership of industries. Hitler stated that the Nazi Party supported \"bodenst\u00e4ndigen Kapitalismus\" (\"productive capitalism\") that was based upon profit earned from one's own labour, but condemned unproductive capitalism or loan capitalism, which derived profit from speculation.\nFascist economics supported a state-controlled economy that accepted a mix of [[private ownership|private]] and [[public ownership]] over the [[means of production]]. [[Economic planning]] was applied to both the public and private sector and the prosperity of private enterprise depended on its acceptance of synchronizing itself with the economic goals of the state. Fascist economic ideology supported the [[profit motive]], but emphasized that industries must uphold the national interest as superior to private profit.\nWhile fascism accepted the importance of material wealth and power, it condemned materialism which identified as being present in both communism and [[capitalism]] and criticized materialism for lacking acknowledgement of the role of the [[spirit]]. In particular, fascists criticized capitalism not because of its competitive nature nor support of private property, which fascists supported\u2014but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence and alleged indifference to the nation. Fascism denounced Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity, which fascists regarded as an attack upon the emotional and spiritual bonds of the nation and a threat to the achievement of genuine national solidarity.\nIn discussing the spread of fascism beyond Italy, historian Philip Morgan states:\nSince the Depression was a crisis of laissez-faire capitalism and its political counterpart, parliamentary democracy, fascism could pose as the 'third-way' alternative between capitalism and Bolshevism, the model of a new European 'civilization'. As Mussolini typically put it in early 1934, \"from 1929... fascism has become a universal phenomenon... The dominant forces of the 19th century, democracy, socialism, [and] liberalism have been exhausted... the new political and economic forms of the twentieth-century are fascist' (Mussolini 1935: 32).\nFascists criticized egalitarianism as preserving the weak, and they instead promoted social Darwinist views and policies. They were in principle opposed to the idea of [[social welfare]], arguing that it \"encouraged the preservation of the degenerate and the feeble.\" The Nazi Party condemned the welfare system of the Weimar Republic, as well as private charity and philanthropy, for supporting people whom they regarded as racially inferior and weak, and who should have been weeded out in the process of natural selection. Nevertheless, faced with the mass unemployment and poverty of the Great Depression, the Nazis found it necessary to set up charitable institutions to help racially-pure Germans in order to maintain popular support, while arguing that this represented \"racial self-help\" and not indiscriminate charity or universal social welfare. Thus, Nazi programs such as the [[Winterhilfswerk|Winter Relief of the German People]] and the broader [[Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt|National Socialist People's Welfare]] (NSV) were organized as quasi-private institutions, officially relying on private donations from Germans to help others of their race\u2014although in practice those who refused to donate could face severe consequences. Unlike the social welfare institutions of the Weimar Republic and the Christian charities, the NSV distributed assistance on explicitly racial grounds. It provided support only to those who were \"racially sound, capable of and willing to work, politically reliable, and willing and able to reproduce.\" Non-Aryans were excluded, as well as the \"work-shy\", \"asocials\" and the \"hereditarily ill.\" Under these conditions, by 1939, over 17 million Germans had obtained assistance from the NSV, and the agency \"projected a powerful image of caring and support\" for \"those who were judged to have got into difficulties through no fault of their own.\" Yet the organization was \"feared and disliked among society's poorest\" because it resorted to intrusive questioning and monitoring to judge who was worthy of support.\nAction.\nFascism emphasizes [[direct action]], including supporting the legitimacy of political violence, as a core part of its politics. Fascism views violent action as a necessity in politics that fascism identifies as being an \"endless struggle\". This emphasis on the use of political violence means that most fascist parties have also created their own private [[militias]] (e.g. the Nazi Party's [[Brown shirts]] and Fascist Italy's [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|Blackshirts]]).\nThe basis of fascism's support of violent action in politics is connected to social Darwinism. Fascist movements have commonly held social Darwinist views of nations, races and societies. They say that nations and races must purge themselves of socially and biologically weak or [[Degeneration|degenerate]] people, while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people, in order to survive in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict.\nAge and gender roles.\n[[File:Piccole Italiane.jpg|thumb|Members of the \"Piccole Italiane\", an organization for girls within the National Fascist Party in Italy]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-04517A, Potsdam, M\u00e4dchen in der F\u00fchrerinnenschule.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[League of German Girls]], an organization for girls within the Nazi Party in Germany]]\nFascism emphasizes [[youth]] both in a physical sense of age and in a spiritual sense as related to virility and commitment to action. The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called \"[[Giovinezza]]\" (\"The Youth\"). Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people who will affect society.\nWalter Laqueur argues that:\nItalian Fascism pursued what it called \"moral hygiene\" of youth, particularly regarding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Fascist Italy promoted what it considered normal sexual behaviour in youth while denouncing what it considered deviant sexual behaviour. It condemned [[pornography]], most forms of [[birth control]] and contraceptive devices (with the exception of the [[condom]]), [[homosexuality]] and [[prostitution]] as deviant sexual behaviour, although enforcement of laws opposed to such practices was erratic and authorities often turned a blind eye. Fascist Italy regarded the promotion of male sexual excitation before [[puberty]] as the cause of criminality amongst male youth, declared homosexuality a social disease and pursued an aggressive campaign to reduce prostitution of young women.\nMussolini perceived women's primary role as primarily child bearers and men, warriors\u2014once saying: \"War is to man what maternity is to the woman\". In an effort to increase birthrates, the Italian Fascist government gave financial incentives to women who raised large families and initiated policies intended to reduce the number of women employed. Italian Fascism called for women to be honoured as \"reproducers of the nation\" and the Italian Fascist government held ritual ceremonies to honour women's role within the Italian nation. In 1934, Mussolini declared that employment of women was a \"major aspect of the thorny problem of unemployment\" and that for women, working was \"incompatible with childbearing\". Mussolini went on to say that the solution to unemployment for men was the \"exodus of women from the work force\".\nThe German Nazi government strongly encouraged women to stay at home to bear children and keep house. This policy was reinforced by bestowing the [[Cross of Honor of the German Mother]] on women bearing four or more children. The unemployment rate was cut substantially, mostly through arms production and sending women home so that men could take their jobs. Nazi propaganda sometimes promoted premarital and extramarital sexual relations, unwed motherhood and divorce, but at other times the Nazis opposed such behaviour.\nThe Nazis decriminalized abortion in cases where fetuses had hereditary defects or were of a race the government disapproved of, while the abortion of healthy pure German, [[Aryan race|Aryan]] fetuses remained strictly forbidden. For non-Aryans, abortion was often compulsory. Their [[eugenics]] program also stemmed from the \"progressive biomedical model\" of [[Weimar Germany]]. In 1935, Nazi Germany expanded the legality of [[history of abortion|abortion]] by amending [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring|its eugenics law]], to promote abortion for women with hereditary disorders. The law allowed abortion if a woman gave her permission and the fetus was not yet viable and for purposes of so-called [[racial hygiene]].\nThe Nazis said that homosexuality was degenerate, effeminate, perverted and undermined masculinity because it did not produce children. They considered homosexuality curable through therapy, citing modern [[scientism]] and the study of [[sexology]], which said that homosexuality could be felt by \"normal\" people and not just an abnormal minority. Open homosexuals were interned in Nazi concentration camps.\nPalingenesis and modernism.\nFascism emphasizes both palingenesis (national rebirth or re-creation) and [[modernism]]. In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character. Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence. Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as antithetical to national regeneration. Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power and violence. Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly [[Fordism]] and [[scientific management]]. Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures\u2014such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, [[Ernst J\u00fcnger]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]], [[Knut Hamsun]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]].\nIn Italy, such modernist influence was exemplified by Marinetti who advocated a palingenetic modernist society that condemned liberal-bourgeois values of tradition and psychology, while promoting a technological-martial religion of national renewal that emphasized militant nationalism. In Germany, it was exemplified by J\u00fcnger who was influenced by his observation of the technological warfare during World War I and claimed that a new social class had been created that he described as the \"warrior-worker\". J\u00fcnger, like Marinetti, emphasized the revolutionary capacities of technology. He emphasized an \"organic construction\" between human and machine as a liberating and regenerative force that challenged liberal democracy, conceptions of individual autonomy, bourgeois nihilism and decadence. He conceived of a society based on a totalitarian concept of \"total mobilization\" of such disciplined warrior-workers.\nFascist aesthetics.\nAccording to cultural critic [[Susan Sontag]]:\nFascist aesthetics \u2026 flow from (and justify) a preoccupation with situations of control, submissive behavior, extravagant effort, and the endurance of pain; they endorse two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude. The relations of domination and enslavement take the form of a characteristic pageantry: the massing of groups of people; the turning of people into things; the multiplication or replication of things; and the grouping of people/things around an all-powerful, hypnotic leader-figure or force. The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets, uniformly garbed and shown in ever swelling numbers. Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, \"virile\" posing. Fascist art glorifies surrender, it exalts mindlessness, it glamorizes death.\nSontag also enumerates some commonalities between fascist art and the official art of communist countries, such as the obeisance of the masses to the hero, and a preference for the monumental and the \"grandiose and rigid\" choreography of mass bodies. But whereas official communist art \"aims to expound and reinforce a utopian morality\", the art of fascist countries such as Nazi Germany \"displays a utopian aesthetics \u2013 that of physical perfection\", in a way that is \"both prurient and idealizing\".\n\"Fascist aesthetics\", according to Sontag, \"is based on the containment of vital forces; movements are confined, held tight, held in.\" And its appeal is not necessarily limited to those who share the fascist political ideology, because \"fascism ... stands for an ideal or rather ideals that are persistent today under the other banners: the ideal of life as art, the cult of beauty, the fetishism of courage, the dissolution of alienation in ecstatic feelings of community; the repudiation of the intellect; the family of man (under the parenthood of leaders).\"\nCriticism.\nFascism has been widely criticized and condemned in modern times since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II.\nAnti-democratic and tyrannical.\n[[File:Hitler and Franco at Hendaye (en.wiki).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Hitler and Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Meeting at Hendaye]], on 23 October 1940]]\nOne of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a [[tyranny]]. Fascism is deliberately and entirely non-democratic and anti-democratic.\nUnprincipled opportunism.\nSome critics of Italian fascism have said that much of the ideology was merely a by-product of unprincipled [[opportunism]] by Mussolini and that he changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public. [[Richard Washburn Child]], the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini's opportunistic behaviour by writing: \"Opportunist is a term of reproach used to brand men who fit themselves to conditions for the reasons of self-interest. Mussolini, as I have learned to know him, is an opportunist in the sense that he believed that mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than to fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been expended on theories and programmes\". Child quoted Mussolini as saying: \"The sanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its power to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded yesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow. The machine, first of all, must run!\"\nSome have criticized Mussolini's actions during the outbreak of World War I as opportunistic for seeming to suddenly abandon Marxist egalitarian internationalism for non-egalitarian [[nationalism]] and note, to that effect, that upon Mussolini endorsing Italy's intervention in the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, he and the new fascist movement received financial support from foreign sources, such as [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies as well as the British Security Service [[MI5]]. Some, including Mussolini's socialist opponents at the time, have noted that regardless of the financial support he accepted for his pro-interventionist stance, Mussolini was free to write whatever he wished in his newspaper \"Il Popolo d'Italia\" without prior sanctioning from his financial backers. Furthermore, the major source of financial support that Mussolini and the fascist movement received in World War I was from France and is widely believed to have been French socialists who supported the French government's war against Germany and who sent support to Italian socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France's side.\nMussolini's transformation away from Marxism into what eventually became fascism began prior to World War I, as Mussolini had grown increasingly pessimistic about Marxism and egalitarianism while becoming increasingly supportive of figures who opposed egalitarianism, such as Friedrich Nietzsche. By 1902, Mussolini was studying Georges Sorel, Nietzsche and [[Vilfredo Pareto]]. Sorel's emphasis on the need for overthrowing decadent liberal democracy and capitalism by the use of violence, direct action, general strikes and [[Machiavelli|neo-Machiavellian]] appeals to emotion impressed Mussolini deeply. Mussolini's use of Nietzsche made him a highly unorthodox socialist, due to Nietzsche's promotion of elitism and anti-egalitarian views. Prior to World War I, Mussolini's writings over time indicated that he had abandoned the Marxism and egalitarianism that he had previously supported in favour of Nietzsche's \"\u00fcbermensch\" concept and anti-egalitarianism. In 1908, Mussolini wrote a short essay called \"Philosophy of Strength\" based on his Nietzschean influence, in which Mussolini openly spoke fondly of the ramifications of an impending war in Europe in challenging both religion and [[nihilism]]: \"[A] new kind of free spirit will come, strengthened by the war, ... a spirit equipped with a kind of sublime perversity, ... a new free spirit will triumph over God and over Nothing\".\nIdeological dishonesty.\nFascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest. Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism. Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological [[hyperbole]] to justify its actions, although during [[Dino Grandi]]'s tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in \"[[realpolitik]]\" free of such fascist hyperbole. Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and Mussolini's first meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in Austria, [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce [[Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia]].\nAfter antagonism exploded between Nazi Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] over the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in 1934, Mussolini and Italian fascists denounced and ridiculed Nazism's racial theories, particularly by denouncing its [[Nordic race|Nordicism]], while promoting [[Mediterraneanism]]. Mussolini himself responded to Nordicists' claims of Italy being divided into Nordic and Mediterranean racial areas due to Germanic invasions of Northern Italy by claiming that while Germanic tribes such as the [[Lombards]] took control of Italy after the [[fall of Ancient Rome]], they arrived in small numbers (about 8,000) and quickly assimilated into Roman culture and spoke the [[Vulgar Latin|Latin]] language within fifty years. Italian fascism was influenced by the tradition of [[Italian nationalists]] scornfully looking down upon Nordicists' claims and taking pride in comparing the age and sophistication of [[ancient Roman civilization]] as well as the classical revival in the [[Renaissance]] to that of Nordic societies that Italian nationalists described as \"newcomers\" to civilization in comparison. At the height of antagonism between the Nazis and Italian fascists over race, Mussolini claimed that the Germans themselves were not a pure race and noted with irony that the Nazi theory of German racial superiority was based on the theories of non-German foreigners, such as Frenchman Arthur de Gobineau. After the tension in [[German-Italian relations]] diminished during the late 1930s, Italian fascism sought to harmonize its ideology with German Nazism and combined Nordicist and Mediterranean racial theories, noting that Italians were members of the Aryan Race, composed of a mixed Nordic-Mediterranean subtype.\nIn 1938, Mussolini declared upon Italy's adoption of antisemitic laws that Italian fascism had always been antisemitic, In fact, Italian fascism did not endorse [[antisemitism]] until the late 1930s when Mussolini feared alienating antisemitic Nazi Germany, whose power and influence were growing in Europe. Prior to that period, there had been notable [[Jewish Italians]] who had been senior Italian fascist officials, including [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who had also been Mussolini's mistress. Also contrary to Mussolini's claim in 1938, only a small number of Italian fascists were staunchly antisemitic (such as [[Roberto Farinacci]] and Giuseppe Preziosi), while others such as [[Italo Balbo]], who came from [[Ferrara]] which had one of Italy's largest Jewish communities, were disgusted by the antisemitic laws and opposed them. Fascism scholar Mark Neocleous notes that while Italian fascism did not have a clear commitment to antisemitism, there were occasional antisemitic statements issued prior to 1938, such as Mussolini in 1919 declaring that the Jewish bankers in London and New York were connected by race to the Russian Bolsheviks and that eight percent of the Russian Bolsheviks were Jews.\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography.\nSecondary sources.\nFurther reading\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Fascism| ]]\n[[Category:Authoritarianism]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism]]\n[[Category:Corporatism]]\n[[Category:Dictatorship]]\n[[Category:Far-right politics]]\n[[Category:Nationalism]]\n[[Category:Political ideologies]]\n[[Category:Political systems]]\n[[Category:Syncretic political movements]]\n[[Category:Totalitarianism]]\n[[Category:Italian words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Political science terminology]]\n[[Category:Populism]]"}
{"id": "11057", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11057", "title": "Forge", "text": "A forge is a type of hearth used for heating metals, or the workplace (smithy) where such a hearth is located. The forge is used by the smith to heat a piece of metal to a temperature where it becomes easier to shape by forging, or to the point where work hardening no longer occurs. The metal (known as the \"workpiece\") is transported to and from the forge using tongs, which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithy's anvil while the smith works it with a hammer. Sometimes, such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands, the workpiece is transported to the slack tub, which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water. However, depending on the metal type, it may require an oil quench or a salt brine instead; many metals require more than plain water hardening. The slack tub also provides water to control the fire in the forge.\nTypes.\nCoal/coke/charcoal forge.\nA forge typically uses bituminous coal, industrial coke or charcoal as the fuel to heat metal. The designs of these forges have varied over time, but whether the fuel is coal, coke or charcoal the basic design has remained the same.\nA forge of this type is essentially a hearth or fireplace designed to allow a fire to be controlled such that metal introduced to the fire may be brought to a malleable state or to bring about other metallurgical effects (hardening, annealing, and tempering as examples). The forge fire in this type of forge is controlled in three ways: amount of air, the volume of fuel, and shape of the fuel/fire.\nOver thousands of years of forging, these devices have evolved in one form or another as the essential features of this type of forge:\nDuring operation, fuel is placed in or on the hearth and ignited. A source of moving air, such as a fan or bellows, introduces additional air into the fire through the tuyere. With additional air, the fire consumes fuel faster and burns hotter (and cleaner - smoke can be thought of as escaped potential fuel).\nA blacksmith balances the fuel and air in the fire to suit particular kinds of work. Often this involves adjusting and maintaining the shape of the fire.\nIn a typical coal forge, a firepot will be centred in a flat hearth. The tuyere will enter the firepot at the bottom. In operation, the hot core of the fire will be a ball of burning coke in and above the firepot. The heart of the fire will be surrounded by a layer of hot but not burning coke. Around the unburnt coke will be a transitional layer of coal being transformed into coke by the heat of the fire. Surrounding all is a ring or horseshoe-shaped layer of raw coal, usually kept damp and tightly packed to maintain the shape of the fire's heart and to keep the coal from burning directly so that it \"cooks\" into coke first.\nIf a larger fire is necessary, the smith increases the air flowing into the fire as well as feeding and deepening the coke heart. The smith can also adjust the length and width of the fire in such a forge to accommodate different shapes of work.\nThe major variation from the forge and fire just described is a 'backdraft' where there is no fire pot, and the tuyere enters the hearth horizontally from the back wall.\nCoke and charcoal may be burned in the same forges that use coal, but since there is no need to convert the raw fuel at the heart of the fire (as with coal), the fire is handled differently.\nIndividual smiths and specialized applications have fostered the development of a variety of forges of this type, from the coal forge described above to simpler constructions amounting to a hole in the ground with a pipe leading into it.\nGas forge.\nA gas forge typically uses propane or natural gas as the fuel. One common, efficient design uses a cylindrical forge chamber and a burner tube mounted at a right angle to the body. The chamber is typically lined with refractory materials such as a hard castable refractory ceramic or a soft ceramic thermal blanket (ex: Kaowool). The burner mixes fuel and air which are ignited at the tip, which protrudes a short way into the chamber lining. The air pressure, and therefore heat, can be increased with a mechanical blower or by taking advantage of the Venturi effect.\nGas forges vary in size and construction, from large forges using a big burner with a blower or several atmospheric burners to forges built out of a coffee can utilizing a cheap, simple propane torch. A small forge can even be carved out of a single soft firebrick.\nThe primary advantage of a gas forge is the ease of use, particularly for a novice. A gas forge is simple to operate compared to coal forges, and the fire produced is clean and consistent. They are less versatile, as the fire cannot be reshaped to accommodate large or unusually shaped pieces. It is also difficult to heat a small section of a piece. A common misconception is that gas forges cannot produce enough heat to enable forge-welding, but a well-designed gas forge is hot enough for any task.\nFinery forge.\nA finery forge is a water-powered mill where pig iron is refined into wrought iron.\nForging equipment.\nAnvil.\nThe anvil serves as a workbench to the blacksmith, where the metal to be forged is placed. Anvils may seem clunky and heavy, but they are a highly refined tool carefully shaped to suit a blacksmith's needs. Anvils are made of cast or wrought iron with a tool steel face welded on or of a single piece of cast or forged tool steel. Some anvils are made of only cast iron and have no tool steel face. These are not real anvils, and will not serve a blacksmith as such because they are too soft. A common term for a cast iron anvil is \"ASO\" or \"Anvil Shaped Object\". The purpose of a tool steel face on an anvil is to provide what some call \"Rebound\" as well as being hard and not denting easily from misplaced hammer blows. The term rebound means it projects some of the force of the blacksmith's hammer blows back into the metal thus moving more metal at once than if there were no rebound. A good anvil can project anywhere from 50 to 99% of the energy back into the workpiece. The flat top, called the \"face\" is highly polished and usually has two holes (but can have more or less depending on the design). The square hole is called the hardy hole, where the square shank of the hardy tool fits. There are many different kinds of hardy tools. The smaller hole is called the pritchel hole, used as a bolster when punching holes in hot metal, or to hold tools similar to how the hardy tool does, but for tools that require being able to turn a 360-degree angle such as a hold-down tool for when the blacksmith's tongs cannot hold a workpiece as securely as it needs to be. On the front of the anvil, there is sometimes a \"horn\" that is used for bending, drawing out steel, and many other tasks. Between the horn and the anvil face, there is often a small area called a \"step\" or a \"cutting table\" That is used for cutting hot or cold steel with chisels, and hot cut tools without harming the anvil's face. Marks on the face transfer into imperfections in the blacksmith's work.\nHammer.\nThere are many types of hammer used in a blacksmith's workshop but this will name just a few common ones. Hammers can range in shape and weight from half an ounce to nearly 30 pounds depending on the type of work being done with it.\nChisel.\nChisels are made of high carbon steel. They are hardened and tempered at the cutting edge while the head is left soft so it will not crack when hammered. Chisels are of two types, hot and cold chisels. The cold chisel is used for cutting cold metals while the hot chisel is for hot metals. Usually, hot chisels are thinner and therefore can not be substituted with cold chisels. Also, many smiths shape chisels as to have a simple twisted handle as to resemble a hammer, they can be used at a greater distance away from the hot metals. They are very useful and found throughout the world.\nTongs.\nTongs are used by the blacksmith for holding hot metals securely. The mouths are custom made by the smith in various shapes to suit the gripping of various shapes of metal. It is not uncommon for a blacksmith to own twenty or more pairs of tongs; traditionally, a smith would start building their collection during the apprenticeship.\nThere are various types of tongs available in the market.\n(1) flat tong\n(2) rivet or ring tong\n(3) straight lip fluted tong\n(4) gad tong\nFuller.\nFullers are forming tools of different shapes used in making grooves or hollows. They are often used in pairs, the bottom fuller has a square shank which fits into the hardy hole in the anvil while the top fuller has a handle. The work is placed on the bottom fuller and the top is placed on the work and struck with a hammer. The top fuller is also used for finishing round corners and for stretching or spreading metal.\nHardy.\nThe hardy tool is a tool with a square shank that fits in a hardy hole. There are many different kinds of hardy tools such as the hot cut hardy, used for cutting hot metal on the anvil; the fuller tool, used for drawing out metal and making grooves; bending jigs - and too many others to list.\nSlack tub.\nA \"slack tub\" is usually a large container full of water used by a blacksmith to quench hot metal. The slack tub is principally used to cool parts of the work during forging (to protect them, or keep the metal in one area from \"spreading\" for example, nearby hammer blows); to harden the steel; to tend a coal or charcoal forge; and simply to cool the work quickly for easy inspection. In bladesmithing and tool-making the term will usually be changed to a \"quench tank\" because oil or brine is used to cool the metal. The term slack is believed to derive from the word \"slake\", as in slaking the heat.\nTypes of forging.\nDrop forging.\nDrop forging is a process used to shape metal into complex shapes by dropping a heavy hammer with a die on its face onto the workpiece.\nProcess.\nThe workpiece is placed into the forge. Then the impact of a hammer causes the heated material, which is very malleable, to conform to the shape of the die and die cavities. Typically only one die is needed to completely form the part. Extra space between the die faces causes some of the material to be pressed out of the sides, forming flash. This acts as a relief valve for the extreme pressure produced by the closing of the die halves and is later trimmed off of the finished part.\nEquipment.\nThe equipment used in the drop forming process is commonly known as a power or drop hammer. These may be powered by air, hydraulics, or mechanics. Depending on how the machine is powered, the mass of the ram, and the drop height, the striking force can be anywhere from 11,000 to 425,000 pounds.\nThe tools that are used, dies and punches, come in many different shapes and sizes, as well as materials. Examples of these shapes are flat and v-shaped which are used for open-die forging, and single or multiple-impression dies used for closed die forging. The designs for the dies have many aspects to them that must be considered. They all must be properly aligned, they must be designed so the metal and the flash will flow properly and fill all the grooves, and special considerations must be made for supporting webs and ribs and the parting line location. The materials must also be selected carefully. Some factors that go into the material selection are cost, their ability to harden, their ability to withstand high pressures, hot abrasion, heat cracking, and other such things. The most common materials used for the tools are carbon steel and, in some cases, nickel-based alloys.\nWorkpiece materials.\nThe materials that are used most commonly in drop forging are aluminium, copper, nickel, mild steel, stainless steel, and magnesium. Mild steel is the best choice, and magnesium generally performs poorly as a drop forging material."}
{"id": "11059", "revid": "33577654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11059", "title": "Five Pillars of Islam", "text": "The Five Pillars of Islam (' ; also ' \"pillars of the religion\") are some basic acts in Islam, considered mandatory by believers, and are the foundation of Muslim life. They are summarized in the famous hadith of Gabriel. The Sunni and Shia agree on the essential details for the performance and practice of these acts, but the Shia do not refer to them by the same name (see Ancillaries of the Faith, for the Twelvers, and Seven pillars of Ismailism). They make up Muslim life, prayer, concern for the needy, self-purification, and the pilgrimage, if one is able.\nOverview of Five Pillars of Islam.\nThe ritual obligations of Muslims are called the Five Pillars. They are acknowledged and practiced by Muslims throughout the world, notwithstanding their disparities. They are viewed as compulsory for individuals who genuinely wish to pursue a life like that which Muhammad led, which was a prudent and mindful life. Like other religions, Islam holds certain practices to be standard; however, that does not imply that all individuals who regard themselves as Muslims necessarily observe them. Individual participation can vary depending on the individual's faith; for example, not every individual must pray every day, keep the fast, go on Hajj, or donate extensively to charity. Shortly after the Muslim Arabs conquered new terrains, they started raising mosques and castles and commissioning different commemorations and artifacts\u00a0as articulations of their faith and culture. The religious practice of Islam, which signifies \"submission to God\", depends on fundamentals that are known as the Five Pillars. Each of the five pillars is alluded to in the Quran, though in various chapters (\"suwar\"). Further insights concerning these commitments are given in the Hadith.\nThough comparable practices were performed in pre-Islamic Arabia and by Jews and Christians at the time of Muhammad, they were changed in the Quran and Hadith, given a carefully monotheistic center, and identified with the life of the Prophet. In the Quran, in spite of the fact that the Shahada does not show up in full, urges the individuals who accept to obey God and his Messenger. Prayer is alluded to multiple times, with prayer times referenced in , and the demonstrations of bowing and prostrating in 48.29. In a few chapters, Muslims are urged both to pray and give alms (for example ), however what, when and to whom gifts ought to be made is clarified in more detail in the hadith. There is a critical entry on fasting in the Quran (), which alludes to the period of Ramadan and sets out the detail on who ought, and ought not fast, to a certain extent under specific conditions. Regarding the matter of the Hajj, the longest Quranic section () recommends the destination location of the pilgrimage, the lead and exercises of the individuals who participate, urging them to have God as a top priority consistently.\nPillars of Sunni Islam.\nFirst pillar: Shahada (Profession of Faith).\nThe first pillar of Islam is the \"Shahada\", the assertion of faith. There are two shahadas: \"There is no god but God\" and \"Muhammad is the messenger of God\". This set statement is normally recited in Arabic: \"l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101-ll\u0101hu mu\u1e25ammadun ras\u016blu-ll\u0101h\" () \"There is no god but God (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God.\" It is essential to utter it to become a Muslim and to convert to Islam.\nThe first shahada promotes the essential unity of the faith, proclaiming that there is no god but God. The Tawhid, which is the prayer that states \"no god but God\" is a major component of the Islamic faith, for it asserts the monotheistic aspect of Islam, promoting unity of God as the source of existence. The second shahada demonstrates God\u2019s essential mercy. This prayer proclaims Muhammad as the last prophet, and it uses Muhammad as the prime example of guidance for all Muslims. Muhammad received revelation that was distorted by earlier communities, such as Jewish and Christian societies; Muhammad was the recipient of the Quran\u2019s guidance himself and now is bearer of this guidance for the rest of the Muslim community throughout history.\nThe Shahada, or profession of faith is said five times a day during prayer. It is the first thing said to a newborn, and the last thing to a person on their death-bed, showing how the Muslim prayer and the pillars are instrumental from the day a person is born until the day they die.\nSecond Pillar: Salah (Prayer).\nThe Second Pillar of Sunni Islam is Salah, or prayer. Before a prayer is observed, ablutions are performed including washing one's hands, face and feet. A caller (Muezzin in Arabic) chants aloud in from a raised place in the mosque. Verses from the Quran are recited either loudly or silently. These prayers are a very specific type of prayer and a very physical type of prayer called prostrations. These prayers are done five times a day, at set strict times, with the individual facing Mecca. The prayers are performed at dawn, noon, afternoon, evening, and night: the names are according to the prayer times: \"Fajr\" (dawn), \"Dhuhr\" (noon), \"\u02bfA\u1e63r\" (afternoon), \"Maghrib\" (evening), and \"\u02bfIsh\u0101\u02be\" (night). The Fajr prayer is performed before sunrise, Dhuhr is performed in the midday after the sun has surpassed its highest point, Asr is the evening prayer before sunset, Maghrib is the evening prayer after sunset and Isha is the night prayer. All of these prayers are recited while facing in the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca and form an important aspect of the Muslim Ummah. Muslims must wash before prayer; this washing is called \"wudu\" (\"purification\"). The prayer is accompanied by a series of set positions including; bowing with hands on knees, standing, prostrating and sitting in a special position (not on the heels, nor on the buttocks). At every change in position, \"Allah is great\" is said and it is a fixed tradition that has to be recited in each posture. A Muslim may perform their prayer anywhere, such as in offices, universities, and fields. However, the mosque is the preferable place for prayers because the mosque allows for fellowship. These prayers may also be observed individually if one is not able to go to the mosque. Muslims offer special congregational prayers on Friday instead of the normal prayer just after noon. The five daily prayers can never be waived even for those not feeling well, who may pray in bed and even lying down. When traveling, one may observe the afternoon prayers following one another: also the sunset and late evening prayers can be combined too.\nThird Pillar: Zakat (Almsgiving).\nThe Third Pillar of Islam is Zak\u0101t, or alms giving or charity. Zakat means purification which indicates that a payment makes the rest of one's wealth legally and religiously pure. By following this pillar, Muslims have to deduct certain amount of their income to support the Islamic community, and it usually about 2.5% of an individual\u2019s income. This practice is not found in the Quran but rather in the hadith. The tax is used to take good care of the holy places and mosques in the individual's specific Muslim community or to give assistance to those in need or who are impoverished. The word zak\u0101t can be defined as purification and growth because it allows an individual to achieve balance and encourages new growth. The principle of knowing that all things belong to God is essential to purification and growth. Zak\u0101t is obligatory for all Muslims who are able to do so. It is the personal responsibility of each Muslim to ease the economic hardship of others and to strive towards eliminating inequality. Zak\u0101t consists of spending a portion of one's wealth for the benefit of the poor or needy, such as debtors or travelers. A Muslim may also donate more as an act of voluntary charity (\"sadaqah\"), rather than to achieve additional divine reward. Also, Muslims are required to give back to the poor, specifically through financial support, on the streets in addition to the Zak\u0101t. Zak\u0101t shows how the Islam faith impacts the financial situation of a believer, drawing into all aspects of life.\nThere are five principles that should be followed when giving the zak\u0101t:\nFourth Pillar: Sawm (Fasting).\nThe Fourth Pillar of Islam is Sawm, or fasting. Fasting takes place during Ramadan, which is the holy month in the Islamic calendar. Using a lunar calendar means the month of Ramadan shifts 11 days earlier each year. Sawm is directly stated in the Quran saying: \u201ceat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then complete the fast till night\u2026\u201d. The fast occurs from dawn to sunset each day during which time believers are expected to prohibit themselves from any food, drink, sexual intercourse, or smoking. However after sunset and before dawn, individuals can participate in any of the actions previously stated as they desire. The reason for fasting during Ramadan is to remind Muslims that all individuals are similarly needy upon the assistance of Allah and that there are less lucky individuals who need their assistance. Ramadan is a period of reflection when Muslims are called upon to recharge their faith, increment their charity, and make apology. In the Quran, the month of Ramadan was first revealed to Muhammad. Ramadan fasting ends with the \u201cId-ul-Fitr\u201d (Festival of the Breaking of the Fast), which lasts for three days; of the first day of this festival, there is a meeting at the mosque for prayer celebration and each family head gives money for alms.\nThree types of fasting (\"Siyam\") are recognized by the Quran: Ritual fasting, fasting as compensation for repentance (both from Quran 2), and ascetic fasting (from Quran 33).\nRitual fasting is an obligatory act during the month of Ramadan. Muslims must abstain from food and drink from dawn to dusk during this month, and are to be especially mindful of other sins. Fasting is necessary for every Muslim that has reached puberty (unless he/she suffers from a medical condition which prevents him/her from doing so).\nThe fast is meant to allow Muslims to seek nearness and to look for forgiveness from God, to express their gratitude to and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, and to remind them of the needy. During Ramadan, Muslims are also expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam by refraining from violence, anger, envy, greed, lust, profane language, gossip and to try to get along with fellow Muslims better. In addition, all obscene and irreligious sights and sounds are to be avoided.\nFasting during Ramadan is obligatory, but is forbidden for several groups for whom it would be very dangerous and excessively problematic. These include pre-pubescent children, those with a medical condition such as diabetes, elderly people, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Observing fasts is not permitted for menstruating women. Other individuals for whom it is considered acceptable not to fast are those who are ill or traveling. Missing fasts usually must be made up for soon afterward, although the exact requirements vary according to circumstance.\nFifth Pillar: Hajj (Pilgrimage).\nThe final Pillar of Islam is the Hajj, or pilgrimage. During one\u2019s life, a Muslim is required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca during the 12th month of the lunar calendar. This ritual consists of making journey to Mecca wearing only 2 white sheets so all of the pilgrims are identical and there is no class distinction among them. Amid the hajj, every single Muslim man dresses alike in a straightforward fabric, again to emphasize their uniformity. Ladies wear a less complex type of their ordinary dress. Pilgrims put the white sheets on when they enter the sanctuary area of Mecca and enter a state of \u201cihram\u201d or purity. After a Muslim makes the trip to Mecca, he/she is known as a hajj/hajja (one who made the pilgrimage to Mecca). The main rituals of the Hajj include walking seven times around the Kaaba termed \"Tawaf\", touching the Black Stone termed Istilam, traveling seven times between Mount Safa and Mount Marwah termed \"Sa'yee\", and symbolically stoning the Devil in Mina termed Ramee. When at Mecca, the pilgrims go to the Ka\u2019aba in the mosque and walk around it in a circle. They then pray together in official ceremonies, and then they go out to perform the \u201cstanding ceremony\u201d to remember the Farewell Sermon of Muhammad on the Arafat. On the return trip, pilgrims stop in Mina, where they throw 7 stones at stone pillars that represent Satan as to express their hatred for Shaitan (Satan). They then return to Mecca for final ceremonies by circumambulating the Ka\u2019aba seven times and then leave Mecca to journey back home. Ability, physical strength, and economic needs can play a role in whether or not an individual is able to complete this pilgrimage, for the Quran specifically says that only those capable of making the pilgrimage are required. The reason for this journey is to follow in the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad, hoping to gain enlightenment as Muhammad did when he was in the presence of Allah. The pilgrimage of the Hajj is in the Quran.\nThe pilgrim, or the \"haji\", is honoured in the Muslim community. Islamic teachers say that the Hajj should be an expression of devotion to God, not a means to gain social standing. The believer should be self-aware and examine their intentions in performing the pilgrimage. This should lead to constant striving for self-improvement. A pilgrimage made at any time other than the Hajj season is called an \"Umrah\", and while not mandatory is strongly recommended.\nPillars of Shia Islam.\nTwelvers.\nTwelver Shia Islam has five Usul al-Din and ten Furu al-Din, i.e., the Shia Islamic beliefs and practices. The Twelver Shia Islam Usul al-Din, equivalent to a Shia Five Pillars, are all beliefs considered foundational to Islam, and thus classified a bit differently from those listed above. They are:\nIn addition to these five pillars, there are ten practices that Shia Muslims must perform, called the \"Ancillaries of the Faith\" (Arabic: fur\u016b\u02bf al-d\u012bn).\nIsmailis.\nIsma'ilis have their own pillars, which are as follows:\nHistory of the Pillars.\nOne of the greatest assumptions about Islamic history is that the Five Pillars were already set and in place at the time of the Prophet\u2019s death in 632 C.E. However, most changes to these Islamic rituals came from small differences among minority Muslim groups. The major beliefs of the Pillars were already in place, taking the shape of the life and beliefs of the Prophet Muhammad. The Five Pillars are alluded to in the Quran, and some are even specifically stated in the Quran, like the Hajj to Mecca. However, the difference in practice of these traditions are accepted in Islam of the Five Pillars, but this does not mean they have all existed since the life of Muhammad. The evidence of differences shows pillars have not always been consistent to what they are today, so it has taken many years for the Pillars to get to their current and classic form."}

{"id": "11062", "revid": "1457609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11062", "title": "Friction", "text": "Friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other. There are several types of friction:\nWhen surfaces in contact move relative to each other, the friction between the two surfaces converts kinetic energy into thermal energy (that is, it converts work to heat). This property can have dramatic consequences, as illustrated by the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire. Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs, for example when a viscous fluid is stirred. Another important consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may lead to performance degradation or damage to components. Friction is a component of the science of tribology.\nFriction is desirable and important in supplying traction to facilitate motion on land. Most land vehicles rely on friction for acceleration, deceleration and changing direction. Sudden reductions in traction can cause loss of control and accidents.\nFriction is not itself a fundamental force. Dry friction arises from a combination of inter-surface adhesion, surface roughness, surface deformation, and surface contamination. The complexity of these interactions makes the calculation of friction from first principles impractical and necessitates the use of empirical methods for analysis and the development of theory.\nFriction is a non-conservative force - work done against friction is path dependent. In the presence of friction, some kinetic energy is always transformed to thermal energy, so mechanical energy is not conserved.\nHistory.\nThe Greeks, including Aristotle, Vitruvius, and Pliny the Elder, were interested in the cause and mitigation of friction. They were aware of differences between static and kinetic friction with Themistius stating in 350 that \"it is easier to further the motion of a moving body than to move a body at rest\".\nThe classic laws of sliding friction were discovered by Leonardo da Vinci in 1493, a pioneer in tribology, but the laws documented in his notebooks were not published and remained unknown. These laws were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons in 1699 and became known as Amonton's three laws of dry friction. Amontons presented the nature of friction in terms of surface irregularities and the force required to raise the weight pressing the surfaces together. This view was further elaborated by Bernard Forest de B\u00e9lidor and Leonhard Euler (1750), who derived the angle of repose of a weight on an inclined plane and first distinguished between static and kinetic friction.\nJohn Theophilus Desaguliers (1734) first recognized the role of adhesion in friction. Microscopic forces cause surfaces to stick together; he proposed that friction was the force necessary to tear the adhering surfaces apart.\nThe understanding of friction was further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785). Coulomb investigated the influence of four main factors on friction: the nature of the materials in contact and their surface coatings; the extent of the surface area; the normal pressure (or load); and the length of time that the surfaces remained in contact (time of repose). Coulomb further considered the influence of sliding velocity, temperature and humidity, in order to decide between the different explanations on the nature of friction that had been proposed. The distinction between static and dynamic friction is made in Coulomb's friction law (see below), although this distinction was already drawn by Johann Andreas von Segner in 1758.\nThe effect of the time of repose was explained by Pieter van Musschenbroek (1762) by considering the surfaces of fibrous materials, with fibers meshing together, which takes a finite time in which the friction increases.\nJohn Leslie (1766\u20131832) noted a weakness in the views of Amontons and Coulomb: If friction arises from a weight being drawn up the inclined plane of successive asperities, why then isn't it balanced through descending the opposite slope? Leslie was equally skeptical about the role of adhesion proposed by Desaguliers, which should on the whole have the same tendency to accelerate as to retard the motion. In Leslie's view, friction should be seen as a time-dependent process of flattening, pressing down asperities, which creates new obstacles in what were cavities before.\nArthur Jules Morin (1833) developed the concept of sliding versus rolling friction. Osborne Reynolds (1866) derived the equation of viscous flow. This completed the classic empirical model of friction (static, kinetic, and fluid) commonly used today in engineering. In 1877, Fleeming Jenkin and J. A. Ewing investigated the continuity between static and kinetic friction.\nThe focus of research during the 20th century has been to understand the physical mechanisms behind friction. Frank Philip Bowden and David Tabor (1950) showed that, at a microscopic level, the actual area of contact between surfaces is a very small fraction of the apparent area. This actual area of contact, caused by asperities increases with pressure. The development of the atomic force microscope (ca. 1986) enabled scientists to study friction at the atomic scale, showing that, on that scale, dry friction is the product of the inter-surface shear stress and the contact area. These two discoveries explain Amonton's first law \"(below)\"; the macroscopic proportionality between normal force and static frictional force between dry surfaces.\nLaws of dry friction.\nThe elementary property of sliding (kinetic) friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th to 18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws:\nDry friction.\nDry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. The two regimes of dry friction are 'static friction' (\"stiction\") between non-moving surfaces, and \"kinetic friction\" (sometimes called sliding friction or dynamic friction) between moving surfaces.\nCoulomb friction, named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, is an approximate model used to calculate the force of dry friction. It is governed by the model:\nwhere\nThe Coulomb friction formula_2 may take any value from zero up to formula_6, and the direction of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion that surface would experience in the absence of friction. Thus, in the static case, the frictional force is exactly what it must be in order to prevent motion between the surfaces; it balances the net force tending to cause such motion. In this case, rather than providing an estimate of the actual frictional force, the Coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this force, above which motion would commence. This maximum force is known as traction.\nThe force of friction is always exerted in a direction that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note that it is not the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.\nNormal force.\nThe normal force is defined as the net force compressing two parallel surfaces together, and its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces. In the simple case of a mass resting on a horizontal surface, the only component of the normal force is the force due to gravity, where formula_7. In this case, the magnitude of the friction force is the product of the mass of the object, the acceleration due to gravity, and the coefficient of friction. However, the coefficient of friction is not a function of mass or volume; it depends only on the material. For instance, a large aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block. However, the magnitude of the friction force itself depends on the normal force, and hence on the mass of the block.\nIf an object is on a level surface and the force tending to cause it to slide is horizontal, the normal force formula_8 between the object and the surface is just its weight, which is equal to its mass multiplied by the acceleration due to earth's gravity, \"g\". If the object is on a tilted surface such as an inclined plane, the normal force is less, because less of the force of gravity is perpendicular to the face of the plane. Therefore, the normal force, and ultimately the frictional force, is determined using vector analysis, usually via a free body diagram. Depending on the situation, the calculation of the normal force may include forces other than gravity.\nCoefficient of friction.\nThe coefficient of friction (COF), often symbolized by the Greek letter \u00b5, is a dimensionless scalar value which describes the ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together. The coefficient of friction depends on the materials used; for example, ice on steel has a low coefficient of friction, while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of friction. Coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one. It is an axiom of the nature of friction between metal surfaces that it is greater between two surfaces of similar metals than between two surfaces of different metals\u2014 hence, brass will have a higher coefficient of friction when moved against brass, but less if moved against steel or aluminum.\nFor surfaces at rest relative to each other formula_9, where formula_10 is the \"coefficient of static friction\". This is usually larger than its kinetic counterpart. The coefficient of static friction exhibited by a pair of contacting surfaces depends upon the combined effects of material deformation characteristics and surface roughness, both of which have their origins in the chemical bonding between atoms in each of the bulk materials and between the material surfaces and any adsorbed material. The fractality of surfaces, a parameter describing the scaling behavior of surface asperities, is known to play an important role in determining the magnitude of the static friction.\nFor surfaces in relative motion formula_11, where formula_12 is the \"coefficient of kinetic friction\". The Coulomb friction is equal to formula_2, and the frictional force on each surface is exerted in the direction opposite to its motion relative to the other surface.\nArthur Morin introduced the term and demonstrated the utility of the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction is an empirical measurement \u2013 it has to be measured experimentally, and cannot be found through calculations. Rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient of static friction is \"usually\" larger than that of kinetic friction; in some sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.\nMost dry materials in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but teflon, for example, can have a coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at all, an elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that \u00b5 is always &lt; 1, but this is not true. While in most relevant applications \u00b5 &lt; 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example, silicone rubber or acrylic rubber-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1.\nWhile it is often stated that the COF is a \"material property,\" it is better categorized as a \"system property.\" Unlike true material properties (such as conductivity, dielectric constant, yield strength), the COF for any two materials depends on system variables like temperature, velocity, atmosphere and also what are now popularly described as aging and deaging times; as well as on geometric properties of the interface between the materials, namely surface structure. For example, a copper pin sliding against a thick copper plate can have a COF that varies from 0.6 at low speeds (metal sliding against metal) to below 0.2 at high speeds when the copper surface begins to melt due to frictional heating. The latter speed, of course, does not determine the COF uniquely; if the pin diameter is increased so that the frictional heating is removed rapidly, the temperature drops, the pin remains solid and the COF rises to that of a 'low speed' test.\nApproximate coefficients of friction.\nUnder certain conditions some materials have very low friction coefficients. An example is (highly ordered pyrolytic) graphite which can have a friction coefficient below 0.01.\nThis ultralow-friction regime is called superlubricity.\nStatic friction.\nStatic friction is friction between two or more solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as \"\u03bc\"s, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise as the result of surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for only a fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.\nThe static friction force must be overcome by an applied force before an object can move. The maximum possible friction force between two surfaces before sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of static friction and the normal force: formula_14. When there is no sliding occurring, the friction force can have any value from zero up to formula_15. Any force smaller than formula_15 attempting to slide one surface over the other is opposed by a frictional force of equal magnitude and opposite direction. Any force larger than formula_15 overcomes the force of static friction and causes sliding to occur. The instant sliding occurs, static friction is no longer applicable\u2014the friction between the two surfaces is then called kinetic friction. However, an apparent static friction can be observed even in the case when the true static friction is zero. \nAn example of static friction is the force that prevents a car wheel from slipping as it rolls on the ground. Even though the wheel is in motion, the patch of the tire in contact with the ground is stationary relative to the ground, so it is static rather than kinetic friction. \nThe maximum value of static friction, when motion is impending, is sometimes referred to as limiting friction,\nalthough this term is not used universally.\nKinetic friction.\nKinetic friction, also known as dynamic friction or sliding friction, occurs when two objects are moving relative to each other and rub together (like a sled on the ground). The coefficient of kinetic friction is typically denoted as \"\u03bc\"k, and is usually less than the coefficient of static friction for the same materials. However, Richard Feynman comments that \"with dry metals it is very hard to show any difference.\"\nThe friction force between two surfaces after sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of kinetic friction and the normal force: formula_18. This is responsible for the Coulomb damping of an oscillating or vibrating system.\nNew models are beginning to show how kinetic friction can be greater than static friction. Kinetic friction is now understood, in many cases, to be primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces, rather than interlocking asperities; however, in many other cases roughness effects are dominant, for example in rubber to road friction. Surface roughness and contact area affect kinetic friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces.\nThe origin of kinetic friction at nanoscale can be explained by thermodynamics. Upon sliding, new surface forms at the back of a sliding true contact, and existing surface disappears at the front of it. Since all surfaces involve the thermodynamic surface energy, work must be spent in creating the new surface, and energy is released as heat in removing the surface. Thus, a force is required to move the back of the contact, and frictional heat is released at the front.\nAngle of friction.\nFor certain applications, it is more useful to define static friction in terms of the maximum angle before which one of the items will begin sliding. This is called the \"angle of friction\" or \"friction angle\". It is defined as:\nwhere \"\u03b8\" is the angle from horizontal and \"\u00b5s\" is the static coefficient of friction between the objects. This formula can also be used to calculate \"\u00b5s\" from empirical measurements of the friction angle.\nFriction at the atomic level.\nDetermining the forces required to move atoms past each other is a challenge in designing nanomachines. In 2008 scientists for the first time were able to move a single atom across a surface, and measure the forces required. Using ultrahigh vacuum and nearly zero temperature (5\u00ba K), a modified atomic force microscope was used to drag a cobalt atom, and a carbon monoxide molecule, across surfaces of copper and platinum.\nLimitations of the Coulomb model.\nThe Coulomb approximation follows from the assumptions that: surfaces are in atomically close contact only over a small fraction of their overall area; that this contact area is proportional to the normal force (until saturation, which takes place when all area is in atomic contact); and that the frictional force is proportional to the applied normal force, independently of the contact area. The Coulomb approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule-of-thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though the relationship between normal force and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.\nWhen the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\"Negative\" coefficient of friction.\n, a single study has demonstrated the potential for an \"effectively negative coefficient of friction in the low-load regime\", meaning that a decrease in normal force leads to an increase in friction. This contradicts everyday experience in which an increase in normal force leads to an increase in friction. This was reported in the journal \"Nature\" in October 2012 and involved the friction encountered by an atomic force microscope stylus when dragged across a graphene sheet in the presence of graphene-adsorbed oxygen.\nNumerical simulation of the Coulomb model.\nDespite being a simplified model of friction, the Coulomb model is useful in many numerical simulation applications such as multibody systems and granular material. Even its most simple expression encapsulates the fundamental effects of sticking and sliding which are required in many applied cases, although specific algorithms have to be designed in order to efficiently numerically integrate mechanical systems with Coulomb friction and bilateral or unilateral contact. Some quite nonlinear effects, such as the so-called Painlev\u00e9 paradoxes, may be encountered with Coulomb friction.\nDry friction and instabilities.\nDry friction can induce several types of instabilities in mechanical systems which display a stable behaviour in the absence of friction. \nThese instabilities may be caused by the decrease of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G. Adams and Jo\u00e3o Arm\u00e9nio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces and were later found in periodic rough surfaces. In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the 'song' of a glass harp, phenomena which involve stick and slip, modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity.\nA practically important case is the self-oscillation of the strings of bowed instruments such as the violin, cello, hurdy-gurdy, erhu, etc.\nA connection between dry friction and flutter instability in a simple mechanical system has been discovered, watch the movie for more details.\nFrictional instabilities can lead to the formation of new self-organized patterns (or \"secondary structures\") at the sliding interface, such as in-situ formed tribofilms which are utilized for the reduction of friction and wear in so-called self-lubricating materials.\nFluid friction.\nFluid friction occurs between fluid layers that are moving relative to each other. This internal resistance to flow is named \"viscosity\". In everyday terms, the viscosity of a fluid is described as its \"thickness\". Thus, water is \"thin\", having a lower viscosity, while honey is \"thick\", having a higher viscosity. The less viscous the fluid, the greater its ease of deformation or movement.\nAll real fluids (except superfluids) offer some resistance to shearing and therefore are viscous. For teaching and explanatory purposes it is helpful to use the concept of an inviscid fluid or an ideal fluid which offers no resistance to shearing and so is not viscous.\nLubricated friction.\nLubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a fluid separates two solid surfaces. Lubrication is a technique employed to reduce wear of one or both surfaces in close proximity moving relative to each another by interposing a substance called a lubricant between the surfaces.\nIn most cases the applied load is carried by pressure generated within the fluid due to the frictional viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces. Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, metal or other components can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or failure.\nSkin friction.\nSkin friction arises from the interaction between the fluid and the skin of the body, and is directly related to the area of the surface of the body that is in contact with the fluid. Skin friction follows the drag equation and rises with the square of the velocity.\nSkin friction is caused by viscous drag in the boundary layer around the object. There are two ways to decrease skin friction: the first is to shape the moving body so that smooth flow is possible, like an airfoil. The second method is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is practicable.\nInternal friction.\nInternal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes deformation.\nPlastic deformation in solids is an irreversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. This change may be due to either (or both) an applied force or a change in temperature. The change of an object's shape is called strain. The force causing it is called stress.\nElastic deformation in solids is reversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force. If the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.\nRadiation friction.\nAs a consequence of light pressure, Einstein in 1909 predicted the existence of \"radiation friction\" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, \u201cradiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backward-acting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\u201d\nOther types of friction.\nRolling resistance.\nRolling resistance is the force that resists the rolling of a wheel or other circular object along a surface caused by deformations in the object or surface. Generally the force of rolling resistance is less than that associated with kinetic friction. Typical values for the coefficient of rolling resistance are 0.001.\nOne of the most common examples of rolling resistance is the movement of motor vehicle tires on a road, a process which generates heat and sound as by-products.\nBraking friction.\nAny wheel equipped with a brake is capable of generating a large retarding force, usually for the purpose of slowing and stopping a vehicle or piece of rotating machinery. Braking friction differs from rolling friction because the coefficient of friction for rolling friction is small whereas the coefficient of friction for braking friction is designed to be large by choice of materials for brake pads.\nTriboelectric effect.\nRubbing dissimilar materials against one another can cause a build-up of electrostatic charge, which can be hazardous if flammable gases or vapours are present. When the static build-up discharges, explosions can be caused by ignition of the flammable mixture.\nBelt friction.\nBelt friction is a physical property observed from the forces acting on a belt wrapped around a pulley, when one end is being pulled. The resulting tension, which acts on both ends of the belt, can be modeled by the belt friction equation.\nIn practice, the theoretical tension acting on the belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation can be compared to the maximum tension the belt can support. This helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times the belt or rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping. Mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing basic tasks.\nReducing friction.\nDevices.\nDevices such as wheels, ball bearings, roller bearings, and air cushion or other types of fluid bearings can change sliding friction into a much smaller type of rolling friction.\nMany thermoplastic materials such as nylon, HDPE and PTFE are commonly used in low friction bearings. They are especially useful because the coefficient of friction falls with increasing imposed load. For improved wear resistance, very high molecular weight grades are usually specified for heavy duty or critical bearings.\nLubricants.\nA common way to reduce friction is by using a lubricant, such as oil, water, or grease, which is placed between the two surfaces, often dramatically lessening the coefficient of friction. The science of friction and lubrication is called tribology. Lubricant technology is when lubricants are mixed with the application of science, especially to industrial or commercial objectives.\nSuperlubricity, a recently discovered effect, has been observed in graphite: it is the substantial decrease of friction between two sliding objects, approaching zero levels. A very small amount of frictional energy would still be dissipated.\nLubricants to overcome friction need not always be thin, turbulent fluids or powdery solids such as graphite and talc; acoustic lubrication actually uses sound as a lubricant.\nAnother way to reduce friction between two parts is to superimpose micro-scale vibration to one of the parts. This can be sinusoidal vibration as used in ultrasound-assisted cutting or vibration noise, known as dither.\nEnergy of friction.\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, no energy is destroyed due to friction, though it may be lost to the system of concern. Energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including Aristotle, wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force.\nWhen an object is pushed along a surface along a path C, the energy converted to heat is given by a line integral, in accordance with the definition of work\nwhere\nEnergy lost to a system as a result of friction is a classic example of thermodynamic irreversibility.\nWork of friction.\nIn the reference frame of the interface between two surfaces, static friction does \"no\" work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does \"negative\" work. However, friction can do \"positive\" work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box in the same direction that the box moves, doing \"positive\" work.\nThe work done by friction can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials such as in the process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly. For example, bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction.\nApplications.\nFriction is an important factor in many engineering disciplines."}

{"id": "11064", "revid": "40347300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11064", "title": "Faith", "text": "Faith, derived from Latin \"fides\" and Old French \"feid\", is confidence or trust in a person, thing, or In the context of religion, one can define faith as \"belief in a god or in the doctrines or teachings of religion\".\nReligious people often think of faith as confidence based on a perceived degree of warrant,\nwhile others who are more skeptical of religion tend to think of faith as simply belief without evidence.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"faith\" is thought to date from 1200\u20131250, from the Middle English \"feith\", via Anglo-French \"fed\", Old French \"feid\", \"feit\" from Latin \"fidem\", accusative of \"fid\u0113s\" (trust), akin to \"f\u012bdere\" (to trust).\nStages of faith development.\nJames W. Fowler (1940\u20132015) proposes a series of stages of faith-development (or spiritual development) across the human life-span. His stages relate closely to the work of Piaget, Erikson, and Kohlberg regarding aspects of psychological development in children and adults. Fowler defines faith as an activity of trusting, committing, and relating to the world based on a set of assumptions of how one is related to others and the world.\nStages of faith.\nNo hard-and-fast rule requires individuals pursuing faith to go through all six stages. There is a high probability for individuals to be content and fixed in a particular stage for a lifetime; stages from 2-5 are such stages. Stage 6 is the summit of faith development. This state is often considered as \"not fully\" attainable.\nReligious views.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nIn the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds, ultimately the acceptance of the divine authority of the Manifestations of God. In the religion's view, faith and knowledge are both required for spiritual growth. Faith involves more than outward obedience to this authority, but also must be based on a deep personal understanding of religious teachings.\nBuddhism.\nFaith in Buddhism (', ') refers to a serene commitment in the practice of the Buddha's teaching and trust in enlightened or highly developed beings, such as Buddhas or \"bodhisattvas\" (those aiming to become a Buddha). Buddhists usually recognize multiple objects of faith, but many are especially devoted to one particular object of faith, such as one particular Buddha.\nIn early Buddhism, faith was focused on the Triple Gem, that is, Gautama Buddha, his teaching (the Dhamma), and the community of spiritually developed followers, or the monastic community seeking enlightenment (the Sangha). Although offerings to the monastic community were valued highest, early Buddhism did not morally condemn peaceful offerings to deities. A faithful devotee was called \"up\u0101saka\" or \"up\u0101sika\", for which no formal declaration was required. In early Buddhism, personal verification was valued highest in attaining the truth, and sacred scriptures, reason or faith in a teacher were considered less valuable sources of authority. As important as faith was, it was a mere initial step to the path to wisdom and enlightenment, and was obsolete or redefined at the final stage of that path.\nWhile faith in Buddhism does not imply \"blind faith\", Buddhist practice nevertheless requires a degree of trust, primarily in the spiritual attainment of Gautama Buddha. Faith in Buddhism centers on the understanding that the Buddha is an Awakened being, on his superior role as teacher, in the truth of his Dharma (spiritual teachings), and in his Sangha (community of spiritually developed followers). Faith in Buddhism can be summarised as faith in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. It is intended to lead to the goal of enlightenment, or bodhi, and Nirvana. Volitionally, faith implies a resolute and courageous act of will. It combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the self-confidence that one can do it.\nIn the later stratum of Buddhist history, especially Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, faith was given a much more important role. The concept of the Buddha Nature was developed, as devotion to Buddhas and \"bodhisattvas\" residing in Pure Lands became commonplace. With the arising of the cult of the Lotus S\u016btra, faith gained a central role in Buddhist practice, which was further amplified with the development of devotion to the Amitabha Buddha in Pure Land Buddhism. In the Japanese form of Pure Land Buddhism, under the teachers H\u014dnen and Shinran, only entrusting faith toward the Amitabha Buddha was believed to be a fruitful form of practice, as the practice of celibacy, morality and other Buddhist disciplines were dismissed as no longer effective in this day and age, or contradicting the virtue of faith. Faith was defined as a state similar to enlightenment, with a sense of self-negation and humility.\nThus, the role of faith increased throughout Buddhist history. However, from the nineteenth century onward, Buddhist modernism in countries like Sri Lanka and Japan, and also in the West, has downplayed and criticized the role of faith in Buddhism. Faith in Buddhism still has a role in modern Asia or the West, but is understood and defined differently from traditional interpretations. Within the Dalit Buddhist Movement communities, taking refuge is defined not only as a religious, but also a political choice.\nChristianity.\nThe word translated as \"faith\" in English-language editions of the New Testament, the Greek word \"\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2\" (\"p\u00edstis\"), can also be translated as \"belief\", \"faithfulness\", or \"trust\". Christianity encompasses various views regarding the nature of faith. Some see faith as being persuaded or convinced that something is true. In this view, a person believes something when they are presented with adequate evidence that it is true. The theologian Saint Thomas Aquinas did not hold that faith is mere opinion: on the contrary, he held that it represents a mean (understood in the Platonic sense) between excessive reliance on science (i.e. demonstration) and excessive reliance on opinion.\nNumerous views discuss the results of faith. Some believe that true faith results in good works, while others believe that while faith in Jesus brings eternal life, it does not necessarily result in good works.\nRegardless of which approach to faith a Christian takes, all agree that the Christian faith is aligned with the ideals and the example of the life of Jesus. The Christian sees the mystery of God and his grace, and seeks to know and become obedient to God. To a Christian, faith is not static but causes one to learn more of God and to grow; Christian faith has its origin in God.\nThe definition of faith given by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews at Hebrews 11:1 carries particular weight with Christians who respect the Bible as the source of divine truth. There the author writes:\n\"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" \u2014 King James Version\n\"Now faith is the assurance that what we hope for will come about and the certainty that what we cannot see exists.\" \u2014 International Standard Version\n\u201cThe naive or inexperienced person is easily misled and believes every word he hears, but the prudent man is discreet and astute.\u201d (Proverbs 14:15, Amplified Bible) The Christian apostle Paul wrote: \"Test everything that is said to be sure it is true, and if it is, then accept it.\" (1 Thessalonians 5:21, Living Bible)\nIn Christianity, faith causes change as it seeks a greater understanding of God. Faith is not only fideism or simple obedience to a set of rules or statements. Before Christians have faith, they must understand in whom and in what they have faith. Without understanding, there cannot be true faith, and that understanding is built on the foundation of the community of believers, the scriptures and traditions and on the personal experiences of the believer. In English translations of the New Testament, the word \"faith\" generally corresponds to the Greek noun \u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 (\"pistis\") or to the Greek verb \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9 (\"pisteuo\"), meaning \"to trust, to have confidence, faithfulness, to be reliable, to assure\".\nChristians may recognise different degrees of faith when they encourage each other to and themselves strive to develop, grow, and/or deepen their faith.\nThis may imply that one can measure faith. Willingness to undergo martyrdom indicates a proxy for depth of faith, but does not provide an everyday measurement for the average contemporary Christian. Within the Calvinist tradition the degree of prosperity\nmay serve as an analog of level of faith.\nOther Christian strands may rely on personal self-evaluation to measure the intensity of an individual's faith, with associated difficulties in calibrating to any scale. Solemn affirmations of a creed (a statement of faith) provide broad measurements of details. Various tribunals of the Inquisition, however, concerned themselves with precisely evaluating the orthodoxy of the faith of those it examined - in order to acquit or to punish in varying degrees.\nChristian apologetic views.\nIn contrast to Richard Dawkins' view of faith as \"blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence\", Alister McGrath quotes the Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas (1861\u20131924), who states that faith is \"not blind, but intelligent\" and that it \"commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...\", which McGrath sees as \"a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith\".\nAmerican biblical scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson stated that the Greek word \"pistis\" used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered \"assurance\" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is \"an old verb meaning \"to furnish\", used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence.\" Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means \"to be persuaded\".\nBritish Christian apologist John Lennox argues that \"faith conceived as belief that lacks warrant is very different from faith conceived as belief that has warrant\". He states that \"the use of the adjective 'blind' to describe 'faith' indicates that faith is not necessarily, or always, or indeed normally, blind\". \"The validity, or warrant, of faith or belief depends on the strength of the evidence on which the belief is based.\" \"We all know how to distinguish between blind faith and evidence-based faith. We are well aware that faith is only justified if there is evidence to back it up.\" \"Evidence-based faith is the normal concept on which we base our everyday lives.\"\nPeter S Williams holds that \"the classic Christian tradition has always valued rationality, and does not hold that faith involves the complete abandonment of reason while believing in the teeth of evidence.\" Quoting Moreland, faith is defined as \"a trust in and commitment to what we have reason to believe is true.\"\nRegarding doubting Thomas in John 20:24-31, Williams points out that \"Thomas wasn't asked to believe without evidence\". He was asked to believe on the basis of the other disciples' testimony. Thomas initially lacked the first-hand experience of the evidence that had convinced them... Moreover, the reason John gives for recounting these events is that what he saw is evidence... Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples...But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. John 20:30,31.\nConcerning doubting Thomas, Michael R. Allen wrote, \"Thomas's definition of faith implies adherence to conceptual propositions for the sake of personal knowledge, knowledge of and about a person \"qua\" person\".\nKenneth Boa and Robert M. Bowman Jr. describe a classic understanding of faith that is referred to as \"evidentialism\", and which is part of a larger epistemological tradition called \"classical foundationalism\", which is accompanied by \"deontologism\", which holds that humans have an obligation to regulate their beliefs in accordance with evidentialist structures.\nThey show how this can go too far, and Alvin Plantinga deals with it. While Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source (of the truth claims), yet he sees having faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. \"Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith.\"\nCatholicism.\nThe four-part \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" (CCC) gives Part One to \"The Profession of Faith\". This section describes the content of faith. It elaborates and expands particularly upon the Apostles' Creed. CCC 144 initiates a section on the \"Obedience of Faith\".\nIn the theology of Pope John Paul II, faith is understood in personal terms as a trusting commitment of person to person and thus involves Christian commitment to the divine person of Jesus Christ.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nSome alternative, yet impactful, ideas regarding the nature of faith were presented by Joseph Smith in a collection of sermons, but was not the sole author, now presented as \nHinduism.\nBhakti () literally means \"attachment, participation, fondness for, homage, faith, love, devotion, worship, purity\". It was originally used in Hinduism, referring to devotion and love for a personal god or a representational god by a devotee. In ancient texts such as the \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\", the term simply means participation, devotion and love for any endeavor, while in the \"Bhagavad Gita\", it connotes one of the possible paths of spirituality and towards moksha, as in \"bhakti marga\".\nAhimsa, also referred to as nonviolence, is the fundamental tenet of Hinduism which advocates harmonious and peaceful co-existence and evolutionary growth in grace and wisdom for all humankind unconditionally.\nIn Hinduism, most of the Vedic prayers begins with the chants of Om. Om is the Sanskrit symbol that amazingly resonates the peacefulness ensconced within one's higher self. Om is considered to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants and also creates a calmness, serenity, healing, strength of its own to prevail within and also in the surrounding environment.\nIslam.\nIn Islam, a believer's faith in the metaphysical aspects of Islam is called \"Iman\" (), which is complete submission to the will of God, not unquestionable or blind belief. A man must build his faith on well-grounded convictions beyond any reasonable doubt and above uncertainty. According to the Quran, Iman must be accompanied by righteous deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into Paradise. In the Hadith of Gabriel, \"Iman\" in addition to \"Islam\" and \"Ihsan\" form the three dimensions of the Islamic religion.\nMuhammad referred to the six axioms of faith in the Hadith of Gabriel: \"Iman is that you believe in God and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God].\" The first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an The Quran states that faith can grow with remembrance of God. The Qur'an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.\nJudaism.\nJudaism recognizes the positive value of \"Emunah\" (generally translated as faith, trust in God) and the negative status of the \"Apikorus\" (heretic), but faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in other religions, especially compared with Christianity and Islam. It could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on true knowledge, true prophecy and practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed. Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of Christian faith, which is called Avodah Zarah in Judaism, a minor form of idol worship, a big sin and strictly forbidden to Jews). Rather, in Judaism, one is to honour a (personal) idea of God, supported by the many principles quoted in the Talmud to define Judaism, mostly by what it is not. Thus there is no established formulation of Jewish principles of faith which are mandatory for all (observant) Jews.\nIn the Jewish scriptures, trust in God \u2013 \"Emunah\" \u2013 refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the Torah, notably Deuteronomy 7:9:\nThe specific tenets that compose required belief and their application to the times have been disputed throughout Jewish history. Today many, but not all, Orthodox Jews have accepted Maimonides' Thirteen Principles of Belief.\nA traditional example of \"Emunah\" as seen in the Jewish annals is found in the person of Abraham. On a number of occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible (see Genesis 12-15).\n\"The Talmud describes how a thief also believes in G\u2011d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life\u2014and the life of his victim\u2014he cries out with all sincerity, 'G\u2011d help me!' The thief has faith that there is a G\u2011d who hears his cries, yet it escapes him that this G\u2011d may be able to provide for him without requiring that he abrogate G\u2011d\u2019s will by stealing from others. For \"emunah\" to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation.\"\nSikhism.\nFaith itself is not a religious concept in Sikhism. However, the five Sikh symbols, known as Kakaars or Five Ks (in Punjabi known as pa\u00f1j kakk\u0113 or pa\u00f1j kak\u0101r), are sometimes referred to as the \"Five articles of Faith\". The articles include \"k\u0113s\" (uncut hair), \"ka\u1e45gh\u0101\" (small wooden comb), \"ka\u1e5b\u0101\" (circular steel or iron bracelet), \"kirp\u0101n\" (sword/dagger), and \"kacchera\" (special undergarment). Baptised Sikhs are bound to wear those five articles of faith, at all times, to save them from bad company and keep them close to God.\nEpistemological validity.\nThere is a wide spectrum of opinion with respect to the epistemological validity of faith - that is, whether it is a reliable way to acquire true beliefs.\nFideism.\nFideism is an epistemological theory which maintains that faith is independent of reason, or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular truths (see natural theology). Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief, but describes a particular philosophical proposition in regard to the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid- to late-19th century by way of Catholic thought, in a movement called Traditionalism. The Roman Catholic Magisterium has, however, repeatedly condemned fideism.\nSupport.\nReligious epistemologists have formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument. Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis. Human relations demand trust and commitment. If belief in God is more like belief in other persons, then the trust that is appropriate to persons will be appropriate to God. American psychologist and philosopher William James offers a similar argument in his lecture \"The Will to Believe.\" Foundationalism is a view about the structure of justification or knowledge. Foundationalism holds that all knowledge and justified belief are ultimately based upon what are called properly basic beliefs. This position is intended to resolve the infinite regress problem in epistemology. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of reformed epistemology.\nReformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic. Analytic philosophers Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff develop this view. Plantinga holds that an individual may rationally believe in God even though the individual does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and fideism is that the former requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant. Plantinga has developed reformed epistemology in \"Warranted Christian Belief\" as a form of externalism that holds that the justification conferring factors for a belief may include external factors. Some theistic philosophers have defended theism by granting evidentialism but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive, or in the sense of having a mathematical probability assigned to them. Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by British philosopher Basil Mitchell and analytic philosopher Richard Swinburne, whose arguments are based on Bayesian probability. In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation.\nProfessor of Mathematics and philosopher of science at University of Oxford John Lennox has stated, \"Faith is not a leap in the dark; it\u2019s the exact opposite. It\u2019s a commitment based on evidence\u2026 It is irrational to reduce all faith to blind faith and then subject it to ridicule. That provides a very anti-intellectual and convenient way of avoiding intelligent discussion.\u201d He criticises Richard Dawkins as a famous proponent of asserting that faith equates to holding a belief without evidence, thus that it is possible to hold belief without evidence, for failing to provide evidence for this assertion.\nCriticism.\nBertrand Russell wrote:\nEvolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence. He describes faith as belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, has no ability to make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.\nPhilosophy professor Peter Boghossian argues that reason and evidence are the only way to determine which \"claims about the world are likely true\". Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives as an example of the belief held by that Muslims that Muhammad (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that Joseph Smith (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no \"built-in corrective mechanism\". For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate. Boghossian advocates thinking of faith either as \"belief without evidence\" or \"pretending to know things you don't know\".\nFriedrich Nietzsche expressed his criticism of the Christian idea of faith in passage 51 of The Antichrist: The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an id\u00e9e fixe by no means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves no mountains, but instead raises them up where there were none before: all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a lunatic asylum. Not, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to the lie that sickness is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic asylums. Christianity finds sickness necessary, just as the Greek spirit had need of a superabundance of health\u2014the actual ulterior purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to make people ill. And the church itself\u2014doesn\u2019t it set up a Catholic lunatic asylum as the ultimate ideal?\u2014The whole earth as a madhouse?\u2014The sort of religious man that the church wants is a typical d\u00e9cadent; the moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked by epidemics of nervous disorder; the \u201cinner world\u201d of the religious man is so much like the \u201cinner world\u201d of the overstrung and exhausted that it is difficult to distinguish between them; the \u201chighest\u201d states of mind, held up before mankind by Christianity as of supreme worth, are actually epileptoid in form\u2014the church has granted the name of holy only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds in majorem dei honorem..."}

Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and ecological function. The Food and Agriculture Organization defines a forest as land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Using this definition FRA 2020 found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares or approximately 31 percent of the global land area in 2020 but are not equally distributed around the globe.\nForests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed around the globe. More than half of the world\u2019s forests are found in only five countries (Brazil, Canada, China, Russian Federation and United States of America). The largest part of the forest (45 percent) is found in the tropical domain, followed by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains.\nForests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.\nForests at different latitudes and elevations, and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration form distinctly different biomes: boreal forests around the North Pole, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.\nAlmost half the forest area (49 percent) is relatively intact, while 9 percent is found in fragments with little or no connectivity. Tropical rainforests and boreal coniferous forests are the least fragmented, whereas subtropical dry forest and temperate oceanic forests are among the most fragmented. Roughly 80 percent of the world\u2019s forest area is found in patches larger than 1 million hectares. The remaining 20 percent is located in more than 34 million patches across the world \u2013 the vast majority less than 1 000 hectares in size.\nHuman society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways. Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions. Forests can also affect people's health. Human activities, including unsustainable use of forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.\nDefinition.\nAlthough the word \"forest\" is commonly used, there is no universally recognised precise definition, with more than 800 definitions of forest used around the world. Although a forest is usually defined by the presence of trees, under many definitions an area completely lacking trees may still be considered a forest if it grew trees in the past, will grow trees in the future, or was legally designated as a forest regardless of vegetation type.\nThere are three broad categories of forest definitions in use: administrative, land use, and land cover. Administrative definitions are based primarily upon the legal designations of land, and commonly bear little relationship to the vegetation growing on the land: land that is legally designated as a forest is defined as a forest even if no trees are growing on it. Land use definitions are based upon the primary purpose that the land serves. For example, a forest may be defined as any land that is used primarily for production of timber. Under such a land use definition, cleared roads or infrastructure within an area used for forestry, or areas within the region that have been cleared by harvesting, disease or fire are still considered forests even if they contain no trees. Land cover definitions define forests based upon the type and density of vegetation growing on the land. Such definitions typically define a forest as an area growing trees above some threshold. These thresholds are typically the number of trees per area (density), the area of ground under the tree canopy (canopy cover) or the section of land that is occupied by the cross-section of tree trunks (basal area). Under such land cover definitions, an area of land can only be known as forest if it is growing trees. Areas that fail to meet the land cover definition may be still included under while immature trees are establishing if they are expected to meet the definition at maturity.\nUnder land use definitions, there is considerable variation on where the cutoff points are between a forest, woodland, and savanna. Under some definitions, forests require very high levels of tree canopy cover, from 60% to 100%, excluding savannas and woodlands in which trees have a lower canopy cover. Other definitions consider savannas to be a type of forest, and include all areas with tree canopies over 10%.\nSome areas covered with trees are legally defined as agricultural areas, e.g. Norway spruce plantations in Austrian forest law when the trees are being grown as Christmas trees and below a certain height.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"\" derives from the Old French \"forest\" (also \"for\u00e8s\"), denoting \"forest, vast expanse covered by trees\"; \"forest\" was first introduced into English as the word denoting wild land set aside for hunting without the necessity in definition of having trees on the land. Possibly a borrowing, probably via Frankish or Old High German, of the Medieval Latin , denoting \"open wood\", Carolingian scribes first used \"foresta\" in the Capitularies of Charlemagne specifically to denote the royal hunting grounds of the King. The word was not endemic to Romance languages, e. g. native words for \"forest\" in the Romance languages derived from the Latin \"silva\", which denoted \"forest\" and \"wood(land)\" (\"confer\" the English \"sylva\" and \"sylvan\"); \"confer\" the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese \"selva\"; the Romanian \"silv\u0103\"; and the Old French \"selve\", and cognates in Romance languages, e. g. the Italian \"foresta\", Spanish and Portuguese \"floresta\", etc., are all ultimately derivations of the French word.\nThe precise origin of Medieval Latin is obscure. Some authorities claim the word derives from the Late Latin phrase \"forestam silvam\", denoting \"the outer wood\"; others claim the word is a latinisation of the Frankish *\"forhist\", denoting \"forest, wooded country\", and was assimilated to \"forestam silvam\" pursuant to the common practice of Frankish scribes. The Old High German \"forst\" denoting \"forest\", Middle Low German \"vorst\" denoting \"forest\", Old English \"fyrh\u00fe\" denoting \"forest, woodland, game preserve, hunting ground\" (English \"frith\"), and Old Norse \"f\u00fdri\", denoting \"\"coniferous\" forest\", all of which derive from the Proto-Germanic *\"furh\u00edsa-\", *\"furh\u00ed\u00feija-\", denoting \"a fir-wood, \"coniferous\" forest\", from the Proto-Indo-European *\"perkwu-\", denoting \"a \"coniferous\" or mountain forest, wooded height\" all attest to the Frankish *\"forhist\".\nUses of \"forest\" in English to denote any uninhabited and unenclosed area presently are considered archaic. The Norman rulers of England introduced the word as a legal term, as seen in Latin texts such as the \"Magna Carta\", to denote uncultivated land that was legally designated for hunting by feudal nobility (see Royal Forest).\nThese hunting forests did not necessarily contain many, if any, trees. However, because hunting forests often included significant areas of woodland, \"forest\" eventually came to connote woodland in general, regardless of the density of the trees. By the beginning of the Fourteenth Century, English texts used the word in all three of its senses: common, legal, and archaic. Other English words used to denote \"an area with a high density of trees\" are \"firth\", \"frith\", \"holt\", \"weald\", \"wold\", \"wood\", and \"woodland\". Unlike \"forest\", these are all derived from Old English and were not borrowed from another language. Some present classifications reserve \"woodland\" for denoting a locale with more open space between trees, and distinguish kinds of woodlands as \"open forests\" and \"closed forests\" premised on their crown covers. Finally, \"sylva\" (plural \"sylvae\" or, less classically, \"sylvas\") is a peculiar English spelling of the Latin \"silva\", denoting a \"woodland\", and has precedent in English, including its plural forms. While its use as a synonym of \"forest\" and as a Latinate word denoting a woodland may be admitted, in a specific technical sense it is restricted to denoting the \"species\" of trees that comprise the woodlands of a region, as in its sense in the subject of silviculture. The resorting to \"sylva\" in English indicates more precisely the denotation that use of \"forest\" intends.\nEvolutionary history.\nThe first known forests on Earth arose in the Late Devonian (approximately 380 million years ago), with the evolution of \"Archaeopteris\". \"Archaeopteris\" was a plant that was both tree-like and fern-like, growing to in height. \"Archaeopteris\" quickly spread throughout the world, from the equator to subpolar latitudes. \"Archaeopteris\" formed the first forest by being the first known species to cast shade due to its fronds and forming soil from its roots. \"Archaeopteris\" was deciduous, dropping its fronds onto the forest floor. The shade, soil, and forest duff from the dropped fronds created the first forest. The shed organic matter altered the freshwater environment, slowing it down and providing food. This promoted freshwater fish.\nEcology.\nForests account for 75% of the gross primary productivity of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass.\nThe world's forests contain about 606 gigatonnes of living biomass (above- and below-ground) and 59 gigatonnes of dead wood. The total biomass has decreased slightly since 1990 but biomass per unit area has increased.\nForest ecosystems can be found in all regions capable of sustaining tree growth, at altitudes up to the tree line, except where natural fire frequency or other disturbance is too high, or where the environment has been altered by human activity.\nThe latitudes 10\u00b0 north and south of the equator are mostly covered in tropical rainforest, and the latitudes between 53\u00b0N and 67\u00b0N have boreal forest. As a general rule, forests dominated by angiosperms (\"broadleaf forests\") are more species-rich than those dominated by gymnosperms (\"conifer\", \"montane\", or \"needleleaf forests\"), although exceptions exist.\nForests sometimes contain many tree species within a small area (as in tropical rain and temperate deciduous forests), or relatively few species over large areas (e.g., taiga and arid montane coniferous forests). Forests are often home to many animal and plant species, and biomass per unit area is high compared to other vegetation communities. Much of this biomass occurs below ground in the root systems and as partially decomposed plant detritus. The woody component of a forest contains lignin, which is relatively slow to decompose compared with other organic materials such as cellulose or carbohydrate.\nThe biodiversity of forests varies considerably according to factors such as forest type, geography, climate and soils \u2013 in addition to human use. Most forest habitats in temperate regions support relatively few animal and plant species and species that tend to have large geographical distributions, while the montane forests of Africa, South America and Southeast Asia and lowland forests of Australia, coastal Brazil, the Caribbean islands Central America and insular Southeast Asia have many species with small geographical distributions. Areas with dense human populations and intense agricultural land use, such as Europe, parts of Bangladesh, China, India and North America, are less intact in terms of their biodiversity. Northern Africa, southern Australia, coastal Brazil, Madagascar and South Africa, are also identified as areas with striking losses in biodiversity intactness.\nComponents.\nA forest consists of many components that can be broadly divided into two categories that are biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components. The living parts include trees, shrubs, vines, grasses and other herbaceous (non-woody) plants, mosses, algae, fungi, insects, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and microorganisms living on the plants and animals and in the soil.\nLayers.\nA forest is made up of many layers. The main layers of all forest types are the forest floor, the understory and the canopy. The emergent layer exists in tropical rainforests. Each layer has a different set of plants and animals depending upon the availability of sunlight, moisture and food.\nHowever, in botany and many countries (Germany, Poland, etc.), a different classification of forest vegetation structure is often used: tree, shrub, herb and moss layers, see stratification (vegetation).\nTypes.\nForests can be classified in different ways and to different degrees of specificity. One such way is in terms of the biome in which they exist, combined with leaf longevity of the dominant species (whether they are evergreen or deciduous). Another distinction is whether the forests are composed predominantly of broadleaf trees, coniferous (needle-leaved) trees, or mixed.\nThe number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3 trillion, of which 1.4 trillion are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.6 trillion in the temperate zones, and 0.7 trillion in the coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, and is based on tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America.\nForests can also be classified according to the amount of human alteration. Old-growth forest contains mainly natural patterns of biodiversity in established seral patterns, and they contain mainly species native to the region and habitat. In contrast, secondary forest is regrowing forest following timber harvest and may contain species originally from other regions or habitats.\nDifferent global forest classification systems have been proposed, but none has gained universal acceptance. UNEP-WCMC's forest category classification system is a simplification of other more complex systems (e.g. UNESCO's forest and woodland 'subformations'). This system divides the world's forests into 26 major types, which reflect climatic zones as well as the principal types of trees. These 26 major types can be reclassified into 6 broader categories: temperate needleleaf; temperate broadleaf and mixed; tropical moist; tropical dry; sparse trees and parkland; and forest plantations. Each category is described as a separate section below.\nTemperate needleleaf.\nTemperate needleleaf forests mostly occupy the higher latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, as well as high altitude zones and some warm temperate areas, especially on nutrient-poor or otherwise unfavourable soils. These forests are composed entirely, or nearly so, of coniferous species (Coniferophyta). In the Northern Hemisphere pines \"Pinus\", spruces \"Picea\", larches \"Larix\", firs \"Abies\", Douglas firs \"Pseudotsuga\" and hemlocks \"Tsuga\", make up the canopy, but other taxa are also important. In the Southern Hemisphere, most coniferous trees (members of the Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae) occur in mixtures with broadleaf species, and are classed as broadleaf and mixed forests.\nTemperate broadleaf and mixed.\nTemperate broadleaf and mixed forests include a substantial component of trees in the Anthophyta. They are generally characteristic of the warmer temperate latitudes, but extend to cool temperate ones, particularly in the southern hemisphere. They include such forest types as the mixed deciduous forests of the United States and their counterparts in China and Japan, the broadleaf evergreen rainforests of Japan, Chile and Tasmania, the sclerophyllous forests of Australia, central Chile, the Mediterranean and California, and the southern beech Nothofagus forests of Chile and New Zealand.\nTropical moist.\nThere are many different types of tropical moist forests, with lowland evergreen broad leaf tropical rainforests, for example v\u00e1rzea and igap\u00f3 forests and the terra firma forests of the Amazon Basin; the peat swamp forests, dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia; and the high forests of the Congo Basin. Seasonal tropical forests, perhaps the best description for the colloquial term \"jungle\", typically range from the rainforest zone 10 degrees north or south of the equator, to the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. Forests located on mountains are also included in this category, divided largely into upper and lower montane formations on the basis of the variation of physiognomy corresponding to changes in altitude.\nTropical dry.\nTropical dry forests are characteristic of areas in the tropics affected by seasonal drought. The seasonality of rainfall is usually reflected in the deciduousness of the forest canopy, with most trees being leafless for several months of the year. However, under some conditions, e.g. less fertile soils or less predictable drought regimes, the proportion of evergreen species increases and the forests are characterised as \"sclerophyllous\". Thorn forest, a dense forest of low stature with a high frequency of thorny or spiny species, is found where drought is prolonged, and especially where grazing animals are plentiful. On very poor soils, and especially where fire or herbivory are recurrent phenomena, savannas develop.\nSparse trees and parkland.\nSparse trees and savanna are forests with lower canopy cover of trees. They occur principally in areas of transition from forested to non-forested landscapes. The two major zones in which these ecosystems occur are in the boreal region and in the seasonally dry tropics. At high latitudes, north of the main zone of boreal forest, growing conditions are not adequate to maintain a continuous closed forest cover, so tree cover is both sparse and discontinuous. This vegetation is variously called open taiga, open lichen woodland, and forest tundra. A savanna is a mixed woodland grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses. Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density.\nForest plantations.\nForest plantations are generally intended for the production of timber and pulpwood. Commonly mono-specific, planted with even spacing between the trees, and intensively managed, these forests are not generally important as habitat for native biodiversity. However, they can be managed in ways that enhance their biodiversity protection functions and they can provide ecosystem services such as maintaining nutrient capital, protecting watersheds and soil structure, and storing carbon.\nForest area.\nThe net loss of forest area has decreased substantially since 1990, but the world is not on track to meet the target of the United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests to increase forest area by 3 percent by 2030.\nWhile deforestation is taking place in some areas, new forests are being established through natural expansion or deliberate efforts in others. As a result, the net loss of forest area is less than the rate of deforestation and it too is decreasing: from 7.8 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 4.7 million hectares per year during 2010\u2013 2020. In absolute terms, the global forest area decreased by 178 million hectares between 1990 and 2020, which is an area about the size of Libya.\nSocietal significance.\nForests provide a diversity of ecosystem services including:\nSome researchers state that forests do not only provide benefits, but can in certain cases also incur costs to humans. Forests may impose an economic burden, diminish the enjoyment of natural areas, reduce the food producing capacity of grazing land and cultivated land, reduce biodiversity reduce available water for humans and wildlife, harbour dangerous or destructive wildlife, and act as reservoirs of human and livestock disease.\nThe management of forests is often referred to as forestry. Forest management has changed considerably over the last few centuries, with rapid changes from the 1980s onwards culminating in a practice now referred to as sustainable forest management. Forest ecologists concentrate on forest patterns and processes, usually with the aim of elucidating cause-and-effect relationships. Foresters who practice sustainable forest management focus on the integration of ecological, social, and economic values, often in consultation with local communities and other stakeholders.\nHumans have generally decreased the amount of forest worldwide. Anthropogenic factors that can affect forests include logging, urban sprawl, human-caused forest fires, acid rain, invasive species, and the slash and burn practices of swidden agriculture or shifting cultivation. The loss and re-growth of forest leads to a distinction between two broad types of forest, primary or old-growth forest and secondary forest. There are also many natural factors that can cause changes in forests over time including forest fires, insects, diseases, weather, competition between species, etc. In 1997, the World Resources Institute recorded that only 20% of the world's original forests remained in large intact tracts of undisturbed forest. More than 75% of these intact forests lie in three countries\u2014the boreal forests of Russia and Canada and the rainforest of Brazil.\nAccording to FAO's \"Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020\", an estimated 420 million hectares of forest has been lost worldwide through deforestation since 1990, but the rate of forest loss has declined substantially. In the most recent five-year period (2015\u20132020), the annual rate of deforestation was estimated at 10 million hectares, down from 12 million hectares in 2010\u20132015.\nChina instituted a ban on logging, beginning in 1998, due to the erosion and flooding that it caused. In addition, ambitious tree planting programmes in countries such as China, India, the United States and Vietnam \u2013 combined with natural expansion of forests in some regions \u2013 have added more than seven million hectares of new forests annually. As a result, the net loss of forest area was reduced to 5.2 million hectares per year between 2000 and 2010, down from 8.3 million hectares annually in the 1990s. In 2015, a study for \"Nature Climate Change\" showed that the trend has recently been reversed, leading to an \"overall gain\" in global biomass and forests. This gain is due especially to reforestation in China and Russia. However new forests are not completely equivalent to old growth forests in terms of species diversity, resilience and carbon capture.\nOn 7 September 2015, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released a new study stating that, over the last 25 years, the global deforestation rate has decreased by 50% due to improved management of forests and greater government protection.\nThere is an estimated 726 million ha of forest in protected areas worldwide. Of the six major world regions, South America has the highest share of forests in protected areas, at 31 percent. The area of forest in protected areas globally has increased by 191 million ha since 1990, but the rate of annual increase slowed in 2010\u20132020.\nSmaller areas of woodland in cities may be managed as urban forestry, sometimes within public parks. These are often created for human benefits; Attention Restoration Theory argues that spending time in nature reduces stress and improves health, while forest schools and kindergartens help young people to develop social as well as scientific skills in forests. These typically need to be close to where the children live, for practical logistics.\nCanada.\nCanada has about of forest land. More than 90% of forest land is publicly owned and about 50% of the total forest area is allocated for harvesting. These allocated areas are managed using the principles of sustainable forest management, which includes extensive consultation with local stakeholders. About eight percent of Canada's forest is legally protected from resource development. Much more forest land\u2014about 40 percent of the total forest land base\u2014is subject to varying degrees of protection through processes such as integrated land use planning or defined management areas such as certified forests.\nBy December 2006, over 1,237,000 square kilometres of forest land in Canada (about half the global total) had been certified as being sustainably managed. Clearcutting, first used in the latter half of the 20th century, is less expensive, but devastating to the environment, and companies are required by law to ensure that harvested areas are adequately regenerated. Most Canadian provinces have regulations limiting the size of clear-cuts, although some older clear-cuts can range upwards of in size which was cut over several years.\nLatvia.\nLatvia has about 3,270,000 hectares (12,626 sq mi) of forest land which equates to 50.6% of Latvia's total area (24,938 sq mi). 1,510,000 hectares of forest land (46.3% of total forest land) is publicly owned and 1,750,000 hectares of forest land (53.7% of total forest land) is in private hands. Latvia's forests have been steadily increasing over the years which is in contrast to many other nations, mostly due to the forestation of land not used for agriculture. In 1935 there was only 1,757,000 hectares of forest, today this has increased by more than 150%. Birch is the most common tree at 28.2% followed by pine (26,9%), spruce (18.3%), grey alder (9.7%), aspen (8,0%), black alder (5.7%), oak/ash (1.2%) and finally hardwood making up the rest (2.0%).\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, most forests have historically been affected by humans to some degree, though in recent years improved forestry practices have helped regulate or moderate large scale or severe impacts. However, the United States Forest Service estimates a net loss of about 2 million hectares (4,942,000 acres) between 1997 and 2020; this estimate includes conversion of forest land to other uses, including urban and suburban development, as well as afforestation and natural reversion of abandoned crop and pasture land to forest. However, in many areas of the United States, the area of forest is stable or increasing, particularly in many northern states. The opposite problem from flooding has plagued national forests, with loggers complaining that a lack of thinning and proper forest management has resulted in large forest fires.\nForests named after their creators.\nSome areas of land have been reforested and named after their creators, Larose Forest,and Molai forest are two so named."}
{"id": "11092", "revid": "34626170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11092", "title": "Finger Lakes", "text": "The Finger Lakes are a group of eleven long, narrow, roughly north\u2013south lakes in an area informally called the \"Finger Lakes region\" in New York, in the United States. This region straddles the northern and transitional edge, known as the Finger Lakes Uplands and Gorges ecoregion, of the Northern Allegheny Plateau and the Ontario Lowlands ecoregion of the Great Lakes Lowlands.\nThe geological term \"finger lake\" refers to a long, narrow lake in an overdeepened glacial valley, while the proper name \"Finger Lakes\" goes back to the late 19th century. Cayuga and Seneca Lakes are among the deepest in the United States, measuring and respectively, with bottoms well below sea level. Though none of the lakes' width exceeds , Seneca Lake is long, and , the largest in total area.\nName.\nThe origin of the name \"Finger Lakes\" is uncertain. Currently, the oldest known published use of \"finger lakes\" for this group of 11 lakes is in a United States Geological Survey paper by Thomas Chamberlin that was published in 1883. This paper was later cited and \"Finger Lakes\" formally used as a proper name by R. S. Tarr in a Geological Society of America paper published in 1893. Older usage of \"Finger Lakes\" in either maps, papers, reports, or any other documents remains to be verified.\nLakes.\nThe eleven Finger Lakes, from east to west, are: \nOnondaga Lake to the east, although smaller, is sometimes called \"the 12th Finger Lake\", because it is similar in shape. It is in Appalachian hill terrain, with a historic village linked to other Finger Lakes by US 20. It may have been formed in the same manner as the Finger Lakes, as satellite photos show three valleys similar in character and spacing to the Finger Lakes east of Otisco Lake. The first is the Tully Valley, which includes a chain of small lakes at the south end that could be a \"Finger Lake\" that never formed because of a terminal moraine. The moraine caused the Tioughnioga River to flow south instead of north, the opposite of the Finger Lakes' waters. The next two valleys to the east contain Butternut Creek, which flows north, and the East Branch of the Tioughnioga River, which flows south. The next valley contains Limestone Creek, which flows north. The next valley after that contains Cazenovia Lake.\nOneida Lake, to the northeast of Syracuse, is sometimes included as the \"thumb\", although it is shallow and somewhat different in character from the rest. As with Onondaga and Cazenovia Lakes, it drains into Lake Ontario via the Oswego River and then into the St. Lawrence River ultimately draining into the Atlantic Ocean. Chautauqua Lake, Findley Lake and Kinzua Lake to the west are not considered Finger Lakes; all three drain into the Allegheny River and eventually into the Gulf of Mexico, and in the case of Kinzua and Findley, the lakes are the artificial creation of dams.\nConesus, Hemlock, Canadice, Honeoye, and Otisco are considered the minor Finger Lakes. Other, smaller lakes, including Silver, Waneta, and Lamoka lakes, dot this region. Silver Lake, west of Conesus Lake, would seem to qualify because it is in the Great Lakes watershed, but Waneta and Lamoka lakes are part of the Susquehanna River watershed as they drain into a tributary of the Chemung River.\nEast of Oneida and Cazenovia Lakes are the headwaters of the Susquehanna River and Hudson River watersheds (the former in the foothills of the Catskills, the latter through the Mohawk Valley and southern Adirondack Mountains).\nThe muckland of a valley in Potter, New York, which is part of Torrey Farms, was almost a 12th Finger Lake, as the waterline is just below the surface. It lies between Lakes Canandaigua and Seneca, and was once a swamp.\nGeology.\nThese glacial finger lakes originated as a series of northward-flowing streams. Around two million years ago, the first of many continental glaciers of the Laurentide Ice Sheet moved southward from the Hudson Bay area, initiating the Pleistocene glaciation. These scouring glaciers widened, deepened, and accentuated the existing river valleys. Glacial debris, possibly terminal moraine left behind by the receding ice, acted as dams, allowing lakes to form. Despite the deep erosion of the valleys, the surrounding uplands show little evidence of glaciation, suggesting the ice was thin, or at least unable to cause much erosion at these higher altitudes. The deep cutting by the ice left some tributaries hanging high above the lakes\u2014both Seneca and Cayuga have tributaries hanging as much as 120 m above the valley floors.\nDetailed studies of Marine Isotope Stage 3 and 4 age sediments exposed at a locality called Great Gully on the eastern flank of the Cayuga Lake, near Union Springs, New York, record the presence of a paleolake that existed prior to Cayuga Lake. This paleolake, which is called Glacial Lake Nanette, was a proglacial lake that filled the bedrock valley currently occupied by Cayuga Lake from about 50,000 BP calibrated until it was overridden by a glacial readvance that occurred prior to 30,000 BP calibrated and buried it beneath younger glacial till. This research shows that bedrock valleys, in which the Finger lakes lie, existed prior to the Last Glacial Maximum and developed over multiple glaciations.\nEcological concern.\nMuch of the Finger Lakes area lies upon the Marcellus Shale and the Utica Shale, two prominent natural gas reserves. Due to the recent increase in fracking technology, the natural gas is now accessible to extraction. While some large landowners have leased their lands, and a number of small landowners would like to follow suit, many residents of the Finger Lakes oppose the fracking process due to concerns about groundwater contamination and the industrial impact of the extraction related activities. The first direct actions and local legislative actions against fracking occurred in the Finger Lakes bioregion. In December 2014, the government of New York banned all fracking in the state, citing pollution risks.\nHistory.\nThe Finger Lakes region contains evidence of pre-Iroquois habitation, such as The Bluff Point Stoneworks, but little is known about who may have constructed these enigmatic structures.\nThe Finger Lakes region is a central part of the Iroquois homeland. The Iroquois tribes include the Seneca and Cayuga nations, for which the two largest Finger Lakes are named. The Tuscarora tribe lived in the Finger Lakes region as well, from ca. 1720. The Onondaga and Oneida tribes lived at the eastern edge of the region, closer to their namesake lakes, Oneida Lake and Onondaga Lake. The easternmost Iroquois tribe was the Mohawk.\nDuring colonial times, many other tribes moved to the Finger Lakes region, seeking the protection of the Iroquois. For example, in 1753 remnants of several Virginia Siouan tribes, collectively called the Tutelo-Saponi, moved to the town of Coreorgonel at the south end of Cayuga Lake near present-day Ithaca, until 1779 when their village was destroyed.\nMajor Iroquois towns in the Finger Lakes region included the Seneca town of Gen-nis-he-yo (present-day Geneseo), Kanadaseaga (Seneca Castle, near present-day Geneva), Goiogouen (Cayuga Castle, east of Cayuga Lake), Chonodote (Cayuga town, present-day Aurora), Catherine's Town (near present-day Watkins Glen) and Ganondagan State Historic Site in Victor, New York.\nAs one of the most powerful Indian nations during colonial times, the Iroquois were able to prevent European colonization of the Finger Lakes region for nearly two centuries after first contact, often playing the French off against the British interests in savvy demonstrations of political competence. The renowned ingenuity and adaptibility of the Iroquois people were key tools of resistance against hostile European powers rapidly spreading throughout North America, eager to dominate and increasingly brutal toward native Americans in the Finger Lakes and beyond.\nBy the late 18th century with the French governmental influence gone from Canada Iroquois power had weakened, relative to the steady growth in European-Americans' populations, and internal strife eroded the political unity of the Iroquois Confederacy as they faced pressures from colonists itching to move west and a desire to keep them out of Amerindian lands. During the American Revolutionary War, some Iroquois sided with the British and some with the Americans, resulting in civil war among the Iroquois. In the late 1770s, British-allied Iroquois attacked various American frontier settlements, prompting counter-attacks, culminating in the Sullivan Expedition of 1779, which destroyed most of the Iroquois towns and effectively broke Iroquois power. After the Revolutionary War, the Iroquois and other Indians of the region were assigned reservations. Most of their land, including the Finger Lakes region, was opened up to purchase and settlement.\nRoughly the western half of the Finger Lakes region comprised the Phelps and Gorham Purchase of 1790. The region was rapidly settled at the turn of the 19th century, largely by a westward migration from New England, and to a lesser degree by northward influx from Pennsylvania. The regional architecture reflects these area traditions of the Federal and Greek Revival periods.\nNotable places.\nThe Finger Lakes region, together with the Genesee Country of Western New York, has been referred to as the burned-over district. There, in the 19th century, the Second Great Awakening was a revival of Christianity; some new religions were also formed.\nThe region was active in reform and utopian movements. Many of its Underground Railroad sites have been documented. For example, the Harriet Tubman Home at Auburn recalls the life and work of the African-American \"Moses of her people.\"\nOn the northern end of the Finger Lakes are also Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the women's suffrage movement; Waterloo, the birthplace of Memorial Day; and Palmyra, the birthplace of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. An annual outdoor drama, The \"Hill Cumorah Pageant\", produced by the church, draws thousands of visitors each year.\nHammondsport was the home of aviation pioneer Glenn Curtiss, and favorable air currents make the area a popular spot for glider pilots. Elmira, just to the south, was the home of Mark Twain in his later life, and the site of an infamous Civil War prison. Corning is most noted as the home of Corning Glass Works and the Corning Museum of Glass. Hornell, just southwest of the Finger Lakes, was a major railroad center; locomotives were repaired there until recently. Conesus remains the home of the oldest producer of pure grape sacramental wine in the Western hemisphere.\nNotable among the historic buildings of the region (most linked below) is the Granger Homestead (1816), a large village house in Federal Style at Canandaigua, New York. Another example of the Federal Style is the Prouty-Chew House (1829) at Geneva, portions of which were altered at various times in new fashions.\nThree Greek Revival mansions are situated near three lakes: The Richard DeZeng House, Skaneateles (1839); Rose Hill, Geneva (1839); and Esperanza, Penn Yan (1838). The latter two are open to the public.\nThe Seward House in Auburn, a National Historic Landmark, is a mansion more characteristic of the Civil War era, virtually unchanged from the nineteenth century. Belhurst Castle, Geneva, a stone mansion in the Romanesque Revival style, now serves as an inn. Sonnenberg mansion at Canandaigua is later nineteenth-century residence in the Queen Anne style, known for its restored period gardens. Geneva on the Lake is a villa (1910\u201314) that recalls those on Italian lakes. Now an inn, it has European-style gardens. Many buildings and historic districts of the Finger Lakes region are notable, other than these historic houses.\nImplemented in August 2010, the Hemlock-Canadice State Forest covers that encompass the two western Finger Lakes, Hemlock and Canadice. These lakes have provided drinking water for the City of Rochester for more than 100 years. To protect water quality, the city acquired much of the property around the lakes. Over the decades, the land reforested, but a few traces of its past, such as stone walls or cottage foundations, remain. Today these two lakes, with their steep, forested, largely undeveloped shorelines and deep clear water, provide visitors a glimpse of the Finger Lakes of the past. The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) manages this State Forest for compatible public access for recreation, including fishing, hunting, nature study, boating and hiking. Activities in Hemlock-Canadice State Forest are subject the DEC's Rules and Regulations for the Use of State Lands, 6 NYCRR Part 190, as well as any other applicable state statutes, rules and regulations. These are sensitive areas because they protect public drinking water.\nThe 584 mile (939.9\u00a0km) Finger Lakes Trail and its branch trails run through the southern portion of the Finger Lakes region and also constitutes a portion of the 4,600 mile North Country National Scenic Trail.\nHemlock Lake is home to the state's oldest nesting bald eagle site, dating back to the early 1960s. The nesting bald eagles of Hemlock Lake have fostered a resurgence of bald eagles throughout New York State. Hemlock Lake, originally known as \"O-Neh-Da\" which is Seneca for \"Lake of Hemlock Trees\", is home to the nation's oldest sacramental winery, founded by Bishop McQuaid in 1872. Today, O-Neh-Da Vineyard continues to make premium natural pure grape wine for churches and foodies alike.\nWine.\nThe Finger Lakes area is New York's largest wine-producing region. Over 100 wineries and vineyards are around Seneca, Cayuga, Canandaigua, Keuka, Conesus, and Hemlock Lakes. Because of the lakes' great depth, they provide a lake effect to the lush vineyards that flank their shores. Retaining residual summer warmth in the winter, and winter's cold in the spring, the grapes are protected from disastrous spring frost during shoot growth, and early frost before the harvest. The main grape varieties grown are Chardonnay, Riesling, Gew\u00fcrztraminer, Pinot noir, Cabernet Franc, Vidal blanc, Seyval blanc and many \"Vitis labrusca\" (American native) varieties or cultivars.\nWith the passage of the Farm Winery Act in 1976, numerous wineries are now open to visitors. Wineries are a growth industry of the region, contributing through their production and by attracting visitors. The Finger Lakes American Viticulture Area (AVA) includes two of America's oldest wineries, O-Neh-Da Vineyard (1872) on Hemlock Lake and The Pleasant Valley Wine Company (1860) on Keuka Lake.\nCraft beer.\nAside from wine, the craft beer industry has exploded in the region, with the number of breweries doubling since 2012.\nEducational institutions.\nThe area is also known for higher education learning. The largest is Ivy League institution Cornell University in Ithaca. Other notable schools are Ithaca College, also in Ithaca; Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical University, State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and Le Moyne College, in Syracuse; Tompkins Cortland Community College in Dryden, Ithaca, and Cortland; Wells College in Aurora; Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva; Keuka College in Keuka Park; Finger Lakes Community College in Canandaigua and Geneva; and New York Chiropractic College in Seneca Falls; Cayuga Community College in Auburn.\nNearby the Finger Lakes is the University of Rochester, Nazareth College, St. John Fisher College, Roberts Wesleyan College and Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester; Elmira College in Elmira; Corning Community College in Corning; and the State University of New York at Geneseo.\nMuseums.\nThe Finger Lakes region is home to several museums. These include the Corning Museum of Glass, the Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University, the Strong National Museum of Play, the Glenn H. Curtiss Museum, the Finger Lakes Boating Museum, the Wings of Eagles Discovery Center, the Sciencenter, the Museum of the Earth, the National Soaring Museum, the Rockwell Museum, the Seward House Museum, the William H. Seward and the Samuel Warren Homesteads of the New York Historical Society, birthplace of New York State's first successful commercial winery.\nThe Women's Rights National Historic Park is in Seneca Falls. The park includes the home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the Wesleyan Chapel, where she held the first convention on women's rights in 1848.\nReferences.\nNotes\nBasic Reading"}

{"id": "11100", "revid": "32799300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11100", "title": "Kite", "text": "A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air or lighter-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag forces. A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it. Some kite designs don\u2019t need a bridle; box kites can have a single attachment point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite. One technical definition is that a kite is \u201ca collection of tether-coupled wing sets\u201c. The name derives from its resemblance to a hovering bird.\nThe lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air moves around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached. The anchor point of the kite line may be static or moving (e.g., the towing of a kite by a running person, boat, free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive parakites or vehicle).\nThe same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids, so kites can be used in underwater currents, but there are no everyday uses as yet.\nMan-lifting kites were made for reconnaissance, entertainment and during development of the first practical aircraft, the biplane.\nKites have a long and varied history and many different types are flown individually and at festivals worldwide. Kites may be flown for recreation, art or other practical uses. Sport kites can be flown in aerial ballet, sometimes as part of a competition. Power kites are multi-line steerable kites designed to generate large forces which can be used to power activities such as kite surfing, kite landboarding, kite buggying and snow kiting.\nHistory.\n \nKites were invented in Asia, though their exact origin can only be speculated. The oldest depiction of a kite is from a mesolithic period cave painting in Muna island, southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, which has been dated from 9500\u20139000 years B.C. It depicts a type of kite called \"\", which are still used by modern Muna people. The kite is made from \"kolope\" (forest tuber) leaf for the mainsail, bamboo skin as the frame, and twisted forest pineapple fiber as rope, though modern kites use string.\nIn China, the kite has been claimed as the invention of the 5th-century BC Chinese philosophers Mozi (also Mo Di, or Mo Ti) and Lu Ban (also Gongshu Ban, or Kungshu Phan). Materials ideal for kite building were readily available including silk fabric for sail material; fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line; and resilient bamboo for a strong, lightweight framework. By 549 AD paper kites were certainly being flown, as it was recorded that in that year a paper kite was used as a message for a rescue mission. Ancient and medieval Chinese sources describe kites being used for measuring distances, testing the wind, lifting men, signaling, and communication for military operations. The earliest known Chinese kites were flat (not bowed) and often rectangular. Later, tailless kites incorporated a stabilizing bowline. Kites were decorated with mythological motifs and legendary figures; some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying.\nAfter its introduction into India, the kite further evolved into the fighter kite, known as the patang in India, where thousands are flown every year on festivals such as Makar Sankranti.\nKites were known throughout Polynesia, as far as New Zealand, with the assumption being that the knowledge diffused from China along with the people. Anthropomorphic kites made from cloth and wood were used in religious ceremonies to send prayers to the gods. Polynesian kite traditions are used by anthropologists to get an idea of early \"primitive\" Asian traditions that are believed to have at one time existed in Asia.\nKites were late to arrive in Europe, although windsock-like banners were known and used by the Romans. Stories of kites were first brought to Europe by Marco Polo towards the end of the 13th century, and kites were brought back by sailors from Japan and Malaysia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Konrad Kyeser described dragon kites in \"Bellifortis\" about 1400 AD. Although kites were initially regarded as mere curiosities, by the 18th and 19th centuries they were being used as vehicles for scientific research.\nIn 1752, Benjamin Franklin published an account of a kite experiment to prove that lightning was caused by electricity.\nKites were also instrumental in the research of the Wright brothers, and others, as they developed the first airplane in the late 1800s. Several different designs of man-lifting kites were developed. The period from 1860 to about 1910 became the European \"golden age of kiting\".\nIn the 20th century, many new kite designs were developed. These included Eddy's tailless diamond, the tetrahedral kite, the Rogallo wing, the sled kite, the parafoil, and power kites. Kites were used for scientific purposes, especially in meteorology, aeronautics, wireless communications and photography. The Rogallo wing was adapted for stunt kites and hang gliding and the parafoil was adapted for parachuting and paragliding.\nThe rapid development of mechanically powered aircraft diminished interest in kites. World War II saw a limited use of kites for military purposes (survival radio, Focke Achgelis Fa 330, military radio antenna kites).\nKites are now mostly used for recreation. Lightweight synthetic materials (ripstop nylon, plastic film, carbon fiber tube and rod) are used for kite making. Synthetic rope and cord (nylon, polyethylene, kevlar and dyneema) are used as bridle and kite line.\nMaterials.\nDesigns often emulate flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. The finest Chinese kites are made from split bamboo (usually golden bamboo), covered with silk, and hand painted. On larger kites, clever hinges and latches allow the kite to be disassembled and compactly folded for storage or transport. Cheaper mass-produced kites are often made from printed polyester rather than silk.\nTails are used for some single-line kite designs to keep the kite's nose pointing into the wind. Spinners and spinsocks can be attached to the flying line for visual effect. There are rotating wind socks which spin like a turbine. On large display kites these tails, spinners and spinsocks can be long or more.\nModern aerobatic kites use two or four lines to allow fine control of the kite's angle to the wind. Traction kites may have an additional line to de-power the kite and quick-release mechanisms to disengage flyer and kite in an emergency.\nPractical uses.\nKites have been used for human flight, military applications, science and meteorology, photography, lifting radio antennas, generating power, aerodynamics experiments, and much more.\nMilitary applications.\nKites have been used for military purposes in the past, such as signaling, delivery of ammunition, and for observation, both by lifting an observer above the field of battle and by using kite aerial photography.\nKites were first used in warfare by the Chinese. During the Song dynasty the \"Fire Crow\", a kite carrying incendiary powder, a fuse, and a burning stick of incense was developed as a weapon.\nAccording to \"Samguk Sagi\", in 647 Kim Yu-sin, a Korean general of Silla rallied his troops to defeat rebels by using flaming kites which also scared the enemy.\nRussian chronicles mention Prince Oleg of Novgorod use of kites during the siege of Constantinople in 906: \"and he crafted horses and men of paper, armed and gilded, and lifted them into the air over the city; the Greeks saw them and feared them\".\nWalter de Milemete's 1326 \"De nobilitatibus, sapientiis, et prudentiis regum\" treatise depicts a group of knights flying kite laden with a black-powder filled firebomb over the wall of city.\nKites were also used by Admiral Yi of the Joseon Dynasty (13921910) of Korea. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598), Admiral Yi commanded his navy using kites. His kites had specific markings directing his fleet to perform various orders.\nIn the modern era the British Army used kites to haul human lookouts into the air for observation purposes, using the kites developed by Samuel Franklin Cody. Barrage kites were used to protect shipping during the Second World War. Kites were also used for anti-aircraft target practice.\nKites and kytoons were used for lofting communications antenna. Submarines lofted observers in rotary kites.\nPalestinians from the Gaza Strip have flown firebomb kites over the Israel\u2013Gaza barrier, setting fires on the Israeli side of the border, hundreds of dunams of Israeli crop fields were burned by firebomb kites launched from Gaza, with an estimated economic loss of several millions of shekels.\nScience and meteorology.\nKites have been used for scientific purposes, such as Benjamin Franklin's famous experiment proving that lightning is electricity. Kites were the precursors to the traditional aircraft, and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft. Alexander Graham Bell experimented with very large man-lifting kites, as did the Wright brothers and Lawrence Hargrave. Kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for weather forecasting. Francis Ronalds and William Radcliffe Birt described a very stable kite at Kew Observatory as early as 1847 that was trialled for the purpose of supporting self-registering meteorological instruments at height.\nRadio aerials and light beacons.\nKites can be used for radio purposes, by kites carrying antennas for MF, LF or VLF-transmitters. This method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by Marconi. Captive balloons may be more convenient for such experiments, because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind, which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor. It must be taken into account during experiments, that a conductor carried by a kite can lead to high voltage toward ground, which can endanger people and equipment, if suitable precautions (grounding through resistors or a parallel resonant circuit tuned to transmission frequency) are not taken.\nKites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights.\nKite traction.\nKites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind. Efficient foil-type kites such as power kites can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft, provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels, center boards, wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft. In the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular, such as kite buggying, kite landboarding, kite boating and kite surfing. Snow kiting has also become popular in recent years.\nKite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing:\nUnderwater kites.\nUnderwater kites are now being developed to harvest renewable power from the flow of water.\nCultural uses.\nKite festivals are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world. They include large local events, traditional festivals which have been held for hundreds of years and major international festivals which bring in kite flyers from other countries to display their unique art kites and demonstrate the latest technical kites.\nMany countries have kite museums. These museums may have a focus on historical kites, preserving the country\u2019s kite traditions.\nAsia.\nKite flying is popular in many Asian countries, where it often takes the form of \"kite fighting\", in which participants try to snag each other's kites or cut other kites down. Fighter kites are usually small, flattened diamond-shaped kites made of paper and bamboo. Tails are not used on fighter kites so that agility and maneuverability are not compromised.\nIn Afghanistan, kite flying is a popular game, and is known in Dari as \"Gudiparan Bazi\". Some kite fighters pass their strings through a mixture of ground glass powder and glue, which is legal. The resulting strings are very abrasive and can sever the competitor's strings more easily. The abrasive strings can also injure people. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, kite flying was banned, among various other recreations.\nIn Pakistan, kite flying is often known as Gudi-Bazi or Patang-bazi. Although kite flying is a popular ritual for the celebration of spring festival known as Jashn-e-Baharaan (lit. Spring Festival) or Basant, kites are flown throughout the year. Kite fighting is a very popular pastime all around Pakistan, but mostly in urban centers across the country (especially Lahore). The kite fights are at their highest during the spring celebrations and the fighters enjoy competing with rivals to cut-loose the string of the others kite, popularly known as \"Paecha\". During the spring festival, kite flying competitions are held across the country and the skies are colored with kites. When a competitor succeeds in cutting another's kite loose, shouts of 'wo kata' ring through the air. Cut kites are reclaimed by chasing after them. This is a popular ritual, especially among the country's youth, and is depicted in the 2007 film \"The Kite Runner\" (although that story is based in neighboring Afghanistan). Kites and strings are a big business in the country and several different types of string are used, including glass-coated, metal, and tandi. Kite flying was banned in Punjab, India due to more than one motorcyclist death caused by glass-coated or metal kite strings. Kup, Patang, Guda, and Nakhlaoo are some of the popular kite brands; they vary in balance, weight and speed.\nIn Indonesia kites are flown as both sport and recreation. One of the most popular kite variants is from Bali. Balinese kites are unique and they have different designs and forms; birds, butterflies, dragons, ships, etc. In Vietnam, kites are flown without tails. Instead small flutes are attached allowing the wind to \"hum\" a musical tune. There are other forms of sound-making kites. In Bali, large bows are attached to the front of the kites to make a deep throbbing vibration, and in Malaysia, a row of gourds with sound-slots are used to create a whistle as the kite flies. Malaysia is also home to the Kite Museum in Malacca.\nKite are also popular in Nepal, especially in hilly areas and among the Pahadi and Newar communities, although people also fly kites in Terai areas. Unlike India, people in Nepal fly kites in August \u2013 September period and is more popular in time of Dashain.\nKites are very popular in India, with the states of Gujarat, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Punjab notable for their kite fighting festivals. Highly maneuverable single-string paper and bamboo kites are flown from the rooftops while using line friction in an attempt to cut each other's kite lines, either by letting the cutting line loose at high speed or by pulling the line in a fast and repeated manner. During the Indian spring festival of Makar Sankranti, near the middle of January, millions of people fly kites all over northern India. Kite flying in Hyderabad starts a month before this, but kite flying/fighting is an important part of other celebrations, including Republic Day, Independence Day, Raksha Bandhan, Viswakarma Puja day in late September and Janmashtami. An international kite festival is held every year before Uttarayan for three days in Vadodara, Surat and Ahmedabad.\nKites have been flown in China since ancient times. Weifang is home to the largest kite museum in the world. It also hosts an annual international kite festival on the large salt flats south of the city. There are several kite museums in Japan, UK, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA.\nIn the olden days, Malays in Singapore, kites were used for fishing.\nIn Japan, kite flying is traditionally a children's play in New Year holidays and in the Boys' Festival in May. In some areas, there is a tradition to celebrate a new boy baby with a new kite (\u795d\u3044\u51e7). There are many kite festivals throughout Japan. The most famous one is \"Y\u014dkaichi Giant Kite Festival\" in Higashi\u014dmi, Shiga, which started in 1841. The largest kite ever built in the festival is wide by high and weighs . In the Hamamatsu Kite Festival in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, more than 100 kites are flown in the sky over the Nakatajima Sand Dunes, one of the three largest sand dunes in Japan, which overlooks the Enshunada Sea. Parents who have a new baby prepare a new kite with their baby's name and fly it in the festival. These kites are traditional ones made from bamboo and paper.\nEurope.\nIn Greece and Cyprus, flying kites is a tradition for Clean Monday, the first day of Lent. In the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda, traditional Bermuda kites are made and flown at Easter, to symbolise Christ's ascent. In Fuerteventura a kite festival is usually held on the weekend nearest to 8 November lasting for 3 days.\nPolynesia.\nPolynesian traditional kites are sometimes used at ceremonies and variants of traditional kites for amusement. Older pieces are kept in museums. These are treasured by the people of Polynesia.\nSouth America.\nIn Brazil, flying a kite is a very popular leisure activity for children, teenagers and even young adults. Mostly these are boys, and it is overwhelmingly kite fighting a game whose goal is to maneuver their own kites to cut the other persons' kites' strings during flight, and followed by kite running where participants race through the streets to take the free-drifting kites. As in other countries with similar traditions, injuries are common and motorcyclists in particular need to take precautions.\nIn Chile, kites are very popular, especially during Independence Day festivities (September 18).\nIn Peru, kites are also very popular. There are kite festivals in parks and beaches mostly on August.\nIn Colombia, kites can be seen flown in parks and recreation areas during August which is calles as windy. It is during this month that most people, especially the young ones would fly kites.\nIn Guyana, kites are flown at Easter, an activity in which all ethnic and religious groups participate. Kites are generally not flown at any other time of year. Kites start appearing in the sky in the weeks leading up to Easter and school children are taken to parks for the activity. It all culminates in a massive airborne celebration on Easter Monday especially in Georgetown, the capital, and other coastal areas. The history of the practice is not entirely clear but given that Easter is a Christian festival, it is said that kite flying is symbolic of the Risen Lord. Moore describes the phenomenon in the 19th century as follows:\nThe exact origins of the practice of kite flying (exclusively) at Easter are unclear. Brereton and Yelvington speculate that kite flying was introduced by Chinese indentured immigrants to the then colony of British Guiana in the mid 19th century. The author of an article in the \"Guyana Chronicle\" newspaper of May 6, 2007 is more certain:\nWorld records.\nThere are many world records involving kites.\nThe world's largest kites are inflatable single-line kites. The world record for the largest kite flown for at least 20 minutes is \"The Flag of Kuwait\".\nThe single-kite altitude record is held by a triangular-box delta kite. On 23 September 2014 a team led by Robert Moore, flew a kite to above ground level. The record altitude was reached after 8 series of attempts over a ten-year period from a remote location in western NSW, Australia. The tall and wide Dunton-Taylor delta kite's flight was controlled by a winch system using of ultra high strength Dyneema line. The flight took about eight hours from ground and return. The height was measured with on-board GPS telemetry transmitting positional data in real time to a ground-based computer and also back-up GPS data loggers for later analysis.\nGeneral safety issues.\nThere are safety issues involved in kite-flying. Kite lines can strike and tangle on electrical power lines, causing power blackouts and running the risk of electrocuting the kite flier. Wet kite lines or wire can act as a conductor for static electricity and lightning when the weather is stormy. Kites with large surface area or powerful lift can lift kite fliers off the ground or drag them into other objects. In urban areas there is usually a ceiling on how high a kite can be flown, to prevent the kite and line infringing on the airspace of helicopters and light aircraft. It is also possible for fighter kites to kill people, as happened in India when three spectators were killed in separate incidents during Independence Day, August, 2016\u2014precipitating a ban on certain types of enhanced line.\nThe government of Egypt banned kite-flying in July 2020, seizing 369 kites in Cairo and 99 in Alexandria, citing both safety and national security concerns."}
{"id": "11101", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11101", "title": "Fanzine", "text": "A fanzine (blend of \"fan\" and \"magazine\" or \"-zine\") is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by enthusiasts of a particular cultural phenomenon (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest. The term was coined in an October 1940 science fiction fanzine by Russ Chauvenet and first popularized within science fiction fandom, and from there it was adopted by other communities.\nTypically, publishers, editors, writers and other contributors of articles or illustrations to fanzines are not paid. Fanzines are traditionally circulated free of charge, or for a nominal cost to defray postage or production expenses. Copies are often offered in exchange for similar publications, or for contributions of art, articles, or letters of comment (LoCs), which are then published.\nSome fanzines are typed and photocopied by amateurs using standard home office equipment. A few fanzines have developed into professional publications (sometimes known as \"prozines\"), and many professional writers were first published in fanzines; some continue to contribute to them after establishing a professional reputation. The term fanzine is sometimes confused with \"fan magazine\", but the latter term most often refers to commercially produced publications \"for\" (rather than \"by\") fans.\nOrigin.\nThe origins of amateur fanac \"fan\" publications are obscure, but can be traced at least back to 19th century literary groups in the United States which formed amateur press associations to publish collections of amateur fiction, poetry and commentary, such as H. P. Lovecraft's \"United Amateur\".\nAs professional printing technology progressed, so did the technology of fanzines. Early fanzines were hand-drafted or typed on a manual typewriter and printed using primitive reproduction techniques (e.g., the spirit duplicator or even the hectograph). Only a very small number of copies could be made at a time, so circulation was extremely limited. The use of mimeograph machines enabled greater press runs, and the photocopier increased the speed and ease of publishing once more. Today, thanks to the advent of desktop publishing and self-publication, there is often little difference between the appearance of a fanzine and a professional magazine.\nGenres.\nScience fiction.\nWhen Hugo Gernsback published the first science fiction magazine, \"Amazing Stories\" in 1926, he allowed for a large letter column which printed reader's addresses. By 1927 readers, often young adults, would write to each other, bypassing the magazine. Science fiction fanzines had their beginnings in Serious &amp; Constructive (later shortened to sercon) correspondence. Fans finding themselves writing the same letter to several correspondents sought to save themselves a lot of typing by duplicating their letters.\nEarly efforts included simple carbon copies but that proved insufficient. The first science fiction fanzine, \"The Comet\", was published in 1930 by the Science Correspondence Club in Chicago and edited by Raymond A. Palmer and Walter Dennis. The term \"fanzine\" was coined by Russ Chauvenet in the October 1940 edition of his fanzine \"Detours\". \"Fanzines\" were distinguished from \"prozines,\" (a term Chauvenet also invented): that is, all professional magazines. Prior to that, the fan publications were known as \"fanmags\" or \"letterzines\".\nScience fiction fanzines used a variety of printing methods. Typewriters, school dittos, church mimeos and (if they could afford it) multi-color letterpress or other mid-to-high level printing. Some fans wanted their news spread, others reveled in the artistry and beauty of fine printing. The hectograph, introduced around 1876, was so named because it could produce (in theory) up to a hundred copies. Hecto used an aniline dye, transferred to a tray of gelatin, and paper would be placed on the gel, one sheet at a time, for transfer. Messy and smelly, the process could create vibrant colors for the few copies produced, the easiest aniline dye to make being purple (technically indigo). The next small but significant technological step after hecto is the spirit duplicator, essentially the hectography process using a drum instead of the gelatin. Introduced by Ditto Corporation in 1923, these machines were known for the next six decades as Ditto Machines and used by fans because they were cheap to use and could (with a little effort) print in color.\nThe mimeograph machine, which forced ink through a wax paper stencil cut by the keys of a typewriter, was the standard for many decades. A second-hand mimeo could print hundreds of copies and (with more than a little effort) print in color. The electronic stencil cutter (shortened to \"electrostencil\" by most) could add photographs and illustrations to a mimeo stencil. A mimeo'd zine could look terrible or look beautiful, depending more on the skill of the mimeo operator than the quality of the equipment. Only a few fans could afford more professional printers, or the time it took them to print, until photocopying became cheap and ubiquitous in the 1970s. With the advent of computer printers and desktop publishing in the 1980s, fanzines began to look far more professional. The rise of the internet made correspondence cheaper and \"much\" faster, and the World Wide Web has made publishing a fanzine as simple as coding a web page.\nThe printing technology affected the style of writing. For example, there were alphanumeric contractions which are actually precursors to \"leet-speak\". (A well-known example is the \"initials\" used by Forrest J. Ackerman in his fanzines from the 30s, and 40s, namely \"4sj\". Fans around the world knew Ackerman by three letters \"4sj\" or even two: \"4e\" for \"Forry.\") Fanspeak is rich with abbreviations and concatenations. Where teenagers labored to save typing on ditto masters, they now save keystrokes when text messaging. Ackerman invented nonstoparagraphing as a space-saving measure. When the typist comes to the end of a paragraph, they simply moved the platen down one line.\nNever commercial enterprises, most science fiction fanzines were (and many still are) available for \"the usual,\" meaning that a sample issue will be mailed on request; to receive further issues, a reader sends a \"letter of comment\" (LoC) about the fanzine to the editor. The LoC might be published in the next issue; some fanzines consisted almost exclusively of letter columns, where discussions were conducted in much the same way as they are in internet newsgroups and mailing lists today, though at a relatively glacial pace. Often fanzine editors (\"faneds\") would simply swap issues with each other, not worrying too much about matching trade for trade, somewhat like being on one another's friends list. Without being closely connected with the rest of fandom, a budding faned could read fanzine reviews in prozines, and fanzines reviewed other fanzines. Recent technology has changed the speed of communication between fans and the technology available, but the basic concepts developed by science fiction fanzines in the 1930s can be seen online today. Blogs \u2013 with their threaded comments, personalized illustrations, shorthand in-jokes, wide variety in quality and wider variety of content\u2014follow the structure developed in science fiction fanzines, without (usually) realizing the antecedent.\nSince 1937, science fiction fans have formed amateur press associations (APAs); the members contribute to a collective assemblage or bundle that contains contributions from all of them, called apazines and often containing mailing comments. Some APAs are still active, and some are published as virtual \"e-zines,\" distributed on the Internet. Specific Hugo Awards are given for fanzines, fan writing and fanart.\nMedia.\nMedia fanzines were originally merely a subgenre of SF fanzines, written by science fiction fans already familiar with apazines. The first media fanzine was a \"Star Trek\" fan publication called \"Spockanalia\", published in September 1967 by members of the Lunarians. They hoped that fanzines such as \"Spockanalia\" would be recognized by the broader science-fiction fan community in traditional ways, such as a Hugo Award for Best Fanzine. All five of its issues were published while the show was still on the air, and included letters from D. C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry, and most of the cast members, and an article by future Hugo and Nebula winner Lois McMaster Bujold.\nMany other Star Trek 'zines followed, then slowly zines appeared for other media sources, such as \"Starsky and Hutch\", \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" and \"Blake's 7\". By the mid-1970s, there were enough media zines being published that adzines existed just to advertise all of the other zines available. Although \"Spockanalia\" had a mix of stories and essays, most zines were all fiction. Like SF fanzines, these media zines spanned the gamut of publishing quality from digest-sized mimeos to offset printed masterpieces with four-color covers.\nMen wrote and edited most previous science fiction fanzines, which typically published articles reporting on trips to conventions, and reviews of books and other fanzines. Camille Bacon-Smith later stated that \"One thing you almost never find in a science fiction fanzine is science fiction. Rather ... fanzines were the social glue that created a community out of a worldwide scattering of readers.\" Women published most media fanzines, which by contrast also included fan fiction. By doing so, they \"fill the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen.\" In addition to long and short stories, as well as poetry, many media fanzines included illustrated stories, as well as stand alone art, often featuring portraits of the show or film's principal characters. The art could range from simple sketches, to reproductions of large elaborate works painted in oil or acrylic, though most are created in ink.\nIn the late 1970s, fiction that included a sexual relationship between two of the male characters of the media source (first Kirk/Spock, then later Starsky/Hutch, Napoleon/Illya, and many others) started to appear in zines. This became known as slash from the '/' mark used in adzines to differentiate a K&amp;S story (which would have been a Kirk and Spock friendship story) from a K/S story, which would have been one with a romantic or sexual bent between the characters. Slash zines eventually became their own sub-subgenre; in many fandoms you rarely saw slash and non-slash stories appear in the same zines. By 2000, when web publishing of stories became more popular than zine publishing, thousands of media fanzines had been published; over 500 of them were k/s zines.\nAnother popular franchise for fanzines was the \"Star Wars\" saga. By the time the film \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was released in 1980 Star Wars fanzines had surpassed Star Trek zines in sales. An unfortunate episode in fanzine history occurred in 1981 when Star Wars director George Lucas threatened to sue fanzine publishers who distributed zines featuring the Star Wars characters in sexually explicit stories or art.\nComics.\nComics were mentioned and discussed as early as the late 1930s in the fanzines of science fiction fandom. Famously, the first version of Superman (a bald-headed villain) appeared in the third issue of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's 1933 fanzine \"Science Fiction\". In 1936, David Kyle published \" The Fantasy World \", possibly the first comics fanzine. Malcolm Willits and Jim Bradley started \"The Comic Collector's News\" in October 1947. By 1952, Ted White had mimeographed a four-page pamphlet about Superman, and James Vincent Taurasi, Sr. issued the short-lived \"Fantasy Comics\". In 1953, Bhob Stewart published \"The EC Fan Bulletin\", which launched EC fandom of imitative EC fanzines. A few months later, Stewart, White and Larry Stark produced \"Potrzebie\", planned as a literary journal of critical commentary about EC by Stark. Among the wave of EC fanzines that followed, the best-known was Ron Parker's \"Hoo-Hah!\". After that came fanzines by the followers of Harvey Kurtzman's \"Mad\", \"Trump\" and \"Humbug\". Publishers of these included future underground comics stars like Jay Lynch and Robert Crumb.\nIn 1960, Richard and Pat Lupoff launched their science fiction and comics fanzine \"Xero\". In the second issue, \"The Spawn of M.C. Gaines'\" by Ted White was the first in a series of nostalgic, analytical articles about comics by Lupoff, Don Thompson, Bill Blackbeard, Jim Harmon and others under the heading, \"All in Color for a Dime.\" In 1961, Jerry Bails' \"Alter Ego\", devoted to costumed heroes, f became a focal point for superhero comics fandom and is thus sometimes mistakenly cited as the first comics fanzine.\nContacts through these magazines were instrumental in creating the culture of modern comics fandom: conventions, collecting, etc. Much of this, like comics fandom itself, began as part of standard science fiction conventions, but comics fans have developed their own traditions. Comics fanzines often include fan artwork based on existing characters as well as discussion of the history of comics. Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed some general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine (\"The Comic Reader\" was one example), interview, history, and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises. While perceived quality varied widely, the energy and enthusiasm involved tended to be communicated clearly to the readership, many of whom were also fanzine contributors. Prominent comics zines of this period included \"Alter Ego\", \"The Comic Reader\", and \"Rocket's Blast Comicollector\", all started by Jerry Bails. During the 1970s, many fanzines (\"Squa Tront\", as an example) also became partly distributed through certain comic book distributors.\nProminent British comics fanzines of the 1970s and early 1980s included the long-running \"Fantasy Advertiser\", Martin Lock's \"BEM\", Richard Burton's \"Comic Media News\", Alan Austin's \"Comics Unlimited\", George Barnett's \"The Panelologist\", and Richard Ashford's \"Speakaeasy\".\nAt times, the professional comics publishers have made overtures to fandom via 'prozines', in this case fanzine-like magazines put out by the major publishers. \"The Amazing World of DC Comics\" and the Marvel magazine \"FOOM\" began and ceased publication in the 1970s. Priced significantly higher than standard comics of the period (\"AWODCC\" was $1.50, \"FOOM\" was 75 cents), each house-organ magazine lasted a brief period of years. Since 2001 in Britain, there have been created a number of fanzines pastiching children's comics of the 1970s, and 1980s (e.g. \"Solar Wind\", \"Pony School\", etc.). These adopt a style of storytelling rather than specific characters from their sources, usually with a knowing or ironic twist.\nHorror film.\nAs with comics zines, horror film fanzines grew from related interest within science fiction fan publications. \"Trumpet,\" edited by Tom Reamy, was a 1960s SF zine that branched into horror film coverage. Alex Soma's \"Horrors of the Screen,\" Calvin T. Beck's \"Journal of Frankenstein\" (later \"Castle of Frankenstein\") and Gary Svehla's \"Gore Creatures\" were the first horror fanzines created as more serious alternatives to the popular Forrest J Ackerman 1958 magazine \"Famous Monsters of Filmland.\" \"Gore Creatures\" began in 1961 and continues today as the prozine (and specialty publisher) \"Midnight Marquee.\" \"Garden Ghouls Gazette\" \u2013 a 1960s horror title under the editorship of Dave Keil, then Gary Collins\u2014was eventually headed by the late Frederick S. Clarke (1949\u20132000) and in 1967 became the respected journal \"Cinefantastique.\" It later became a prozine under journalist-screenwriter Mark A. Altman and has continued as a webzine.\nMark Frank's \"Photon\"\u2014notable for the inclusion of an 8x10 photo in each issue\u2014was another 1960s zine that lasted into the 1970s. Richard Klemensen's \"Little Shoppe of Horrors\", having a particular focus on \"Hammer Horrors,\" began in 1972 and is still publishing as of 2019.\nThe Baltimore-based \"Black Oracle\" (1969\u20131978) from writer-turned-John Waters repertory member George Stover was a diminutive zine that evolved into the larger-format \"Cinemacabre.\" Stover's \"Black Oracle\" partner Bill George published his own short-lived zine \"The Late Show\" (1974\u20131976; with co-editor Martin Falck), and later became editor of the \"Cinefantastique\" prozine spinoff \"Femme Fatales.\" In the mid-1970s, North Carolina teenager Sam Irvin published the horror/science-fiction fanzine \"Bizarre\" which included his original interviews with UK actors and filmmakers; Irvin would later become a producer-director in his own right. \n\"Japanese Fantasy Film Journal\" (JFFJ) (1968\u20131983) from Greg Shoemaker covered Toho's \"Godzilla\" and his Asian brethren. (JG) appeared in 1974 and was published for 30 years. In 1993, \"G-FAN\" was published, and reached its 100th regularly published issue in Fall 2012. \"FXRH\" (Special effects by Ray Harryhausen) (1971\u20131976) was a specialized zine co-created by future Hollywood FX artist Ernest D. Farino.\nRock and roll.\nBy the mid-1960s, several fans active in science fiction and comics fandom recognized a shared interest in rock music, and the rock fanzine was born. Paul Williams and Greg Shaw were two such SF-fans turned rock zine editors. Williams' \"Crawdaddy!\" (1966) and Shaw's two California-based zines, \"Mojo Navigator\" (full title, \"Mojo-Navigator Rock and Roll News\") (1966) and \"Who Put the Bomp\", (1970), are among the most important early rock fanzines.\n\"Crawdaddy!\" (1966) quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music \"prozines,\" with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution. \"Bomp\" remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent music journalists, including Lester Bangs, Greil Marcus, Ken Barnes, Ed Ward, Dave Marsh, Mike Saunders and R. Meltzer. \"Bomp\" featured cover art by Jay Kinney and Bill Rotsler, both veterans of SF and Comics fandom. \"Bomp\" was not alone; an August 1970 issue of \"Rolling Stone\" included an article about the explosion of rock fanzines. Other rock fanzines of this period include \"denim delinquent\" 1971, edited by Jymn Parrett, \"Flash,\" 1972, edited by Mark Shipper, \"Eurock Magazine\" (1973\u20131993) edited by Archie Patterson and \"Bam Balam,\" written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland, beginning in 1974, and in the mid-1970s, \"Back Door Man\".\nIn the post-punk era several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including Mike Stax' \"Ugly Things\", Billy Miller and Miriam Linna's \"Kicks\", Jake Austen's \"Roctober\", Kim Cooper's \"Scram\", P. Edwin Letcher's \"Garage &amp; Beat\", and the UK's Shindig! and Italy's \"Misty Lane\".\nIn the 1980s, with the rise of stadium superstars, many home-grown rock fanzines emerged. At the peak of Bruce Springsteen's megastardom following the \"Born in the U.S.A.\" album and Born in the U.S.A. Tour in the mid-1980s, there were no less than five Springsteen fanzines circulating at the same time in the UK alone, and many others elsewhere. Gary Desmond's \"Candy's Room\", coming from Liverpool, was the first in 1980, quickly followed by Dan French's \"Point Blank\", Dave Percival's \"The Fever\", Jeff Matthews' \"Rendezvous\", and Paul Limbrick's \"Jackson Cage\". In the US, \"Backstreets Magazine\" started in Seattle in 1980 and still continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management and official website. In the late 1990s, notorious fanzines and e-zines flourished about electronic and post-rock music. \"Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" fanzine was one of those that documented post-rock genre and experimental music.\nPunk.\nUK.\nThe punk subculture in the United Kingdom spearheaded a surge of interest in fanzines as a countercultural alternative to established print media. The first and still best known UK 'punk zine' was \"Sniffin' Glue\", produced by Deptford punk fan Mark Perry. \"Sniffin' Glue\" ran for 12 photocopied issues; the first issue was produced by Perry immediately following (and in response to) the London debut of The Ramones on 4 July 1976. Other UK fanzines included \"Blam!\", \"Bombsite\", \"Wool City Rocker\", \"Burnt Offering\", \"Sideburns\", \"Chainsaw\", \"New Crimes\", \"Vague\", \"Jamming\", Artcore Fanzine, \"Love and Molotov Cocktails\", \"To Hell With Poverty\", \"New Youth\", \"Peroxide\", \"ENZK\", \"Juniper beri-beri\", \"No Cure\", \"Communication Blur\", \"Rox\", \"Grim Humour\", \"Spuno\"\n, \"Cool Notes\" and \"Fumes\". Of these, Tony Fletcher's \"Jamming\" was the most far reaching, becoming a nationally distributed mainstream magazine for several years before its demise.\nUS.\nIn the US, \"Flipside\" and \"Slash\" were important punk zines for the Los Angeles scene, both debuting in 1977. In 1977 in Australia, Bruce Milne and Clinton Walker fused their respective punk zines \"Plastered Press\" and \"Suicide Alley\" to launch \"Pulp\"; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with \"Fast Forward\", in 1980. Starting earlier, in 1976, \"Punk\" was published in New York and played a major part in popularizing punk rock (a term coined a few years earlier in \"Creem\") as the term for the music and the bands being written about.\nAmong later titles, \"Maximum RocknRoll\" is a major punk zine, with over 300 issues published. As a result, in part, of the popular and commercial resurgence of punk in the late 1980s, and after, with the growing popularity of such bands as Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Fugazi, Bikini Kill, Green Day and The Offspring, a number of other punk zines have appeared, such as \"Punk Planet\", \"Razorcake\", \"Tail Spins\", \"Sobriquet\", \"Profane Existence\" and \"Slug and Lettuce\". The early American punkzine \"Search and Destroy\" eventually became the influential fringe-cultural magazine \"Re/Search\".\nSome punk fanzines from the 80s, like No Class fanzine, and Ugly American are experiencing a second life by placing all past content online for free and adding new content. For the past 6 years, Suburban Rebels in Northern California has been leading the Punk zine way.\nMany of the punk zines were printed in small quantities and promoted the local scene. They were often cheaply photocopied and many never survived beyond a few issues. Their greatest contribution was in promoting punk music, clothing and lifestyle in their local communities. Punk bands and independent labels often sent records to the zines for review and many of the people who started the zines became critical connections for punk bands on tour.\nAfter the year 2000.\nIn the UK \"Fracture\" and \"Reason To Believe\" were significant fanzines in the early 2000s, but both ended in late 2003. \"Rancid News\" filled the gap left by these two zines for a short while. On its tenth issue \"Rancid News\" changed its name to \"Last Hours\" with 7 issues published under this title before going on hiatus. \"Last Hours\" still operates as a webzine though with more focus on the anti-authoritarian movement than its original title. \"Artcore Fanzine\" (established in 1986) continues to this day, recently publishing a number of 30-year anniversary issues. There are many smaller fanzines in existence throughout the UK that focus on punk.\nMark Wilkins and Mystic records.\nMark Wilkins, the promotion director for 1982 onwards US punk/thrash label Mystic Records, had over 450 US fanzines and 150 foreign fanzines he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited \"The Mystic News Newsletter\" which was published quarterly and went into every promo package to fanzines. Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine \"Wild Times\" and when he ran out of funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US fanzines under the name of Mystic Mark.\nItaly.\nIn Perugia, Italy, \"Mazquerade\" ran from 1979 to 1981.\nIn Basilicata, Italy, \"Raw Art Fanzine\" ran from 1995 to 2000.\nIn Milano, Italy, \"Gorezilla\" ran from 1988 to 1991.\nMod.\nIn the United Kingdom, the 1979 Mod revival, which was inspired by the 1960s Mod subculture, brought with it a burst of fresh creativity from fanzines, and for the next decade, the youth subculture inspired the production of dozens of independent publications. The most successful of the first wave was \"Maximum Speed\", which successfully captured the frenetic world of a mod revival scene that was propelling bands like Secret Affair, Purple Hearts and The Chords into the UK charts.\nAfter the genre had started to go out of fashion with mainstream audiences in 1981, the mod revival scene went underground and successfully reinvented itself through a series of clubs, bands and fanzines that breathed fresh life into the genre, culminating in another burst of creative acceptance in 1985. This success was largely driven by the network of underground fanzines, the most important and far reaching of which were \"Extraordinary Sensations\", produced by future radio DJ Eddie Piller, and \"Shadows &amp; Reflections\", published by future national magazine editor Chris Hunt. The latter in particular pushed back the boundaries of fanzine production, producing glossy, professionally written and printed publications at a time (1983\u201386) when most fanzines were produced via photocopier and letraset.\nLocal music.\nIn the UK, there were also fanzines that covered the local music scene in a particular town or city. Mainly prevalent in the 1970s, and 1980s, all music styles were covered, whether the bands were playing rock, punk, metal, futurist, ska or dance. Featured were local gig reviews and articles that were below the radar of the mainstream music press. They were produced using the technology of the time, i.e. typewriter and Letraset. Examples include \"Bombsite Fanzine\" (Liverpool 1977), Wool City Rocker (Bradford 1979 \u2013 1982), \"City Fun\" (Manchester), 1984, Spuno (Bath 1980) \"No Cure\" (Berkshire) and \"Town Hall Steps\" (Bolton) and more recently \"mono\" (fanzine), (Bradford) with many more across the country, such as Premonition Tapes Tapezine on cassette (Sheffield 1987) and Crime Pays (Liverpool 1988).\nRole-playing-game fanzines.\nAnother sizable group of fanzines arose in role-playing game (RPG) fandom, where fanzines allowed people to publish their ideas and views on specific games and their role-playing campaigns. In 1975, was released the apazine Alarums and Excursions.\nRole-playing fanzines allowed people to communicate in the 1970s, and 1980s with complete editorial control in the hands of the players, as opposed to the game publishers. These early RPG fanzines were generally typed, sold mostly in an A5 format (in the UK) and were usually illustrated with abysmal or indifferent artwork.\nA fanzine community developed and was based on sale to a reading public and exchanges by editor/publishers. Many of the pioneers of RPG got their start in, or remain part of, science fiction fandom. This is also true of the small but still active board game fandom scene, the most prolific subset of which is centered around play-by-mail Diplomacy.\nThe UK fanzine Aslan (1988\u20131991) was responsible for popularization of freeform role-playing games in the UK.\nVideo gaming.\nVideo game fanzines first emerged during the second generation period at a time when gaming stores and newsletters for computer user groups were beginning to become established but had not yet receive significant recognition by purchasers and gamers. The earliest such publication was \"Joystick Jolter\". Other subscriber-based newsletters included \"\" (UK, all things Atari, 1st issue Nov 1987), \"The Video Game Update\", and later \"Computer Entertainer\".\nAs desktop publishing tools became more accessible, there was an increase in fanzine production. Fanzines generally emphasized either classic gaming (e.g. \"2600 Connection\" and \"Classic Systems &amp; Games Monthly\"), or current gaming (e.g. \"APE\" and \"The Subversive Sprite\"). Less commonly, some fanzines covered both topics (e.g. \"Digital Press\" and \"Joystick &amp; Screen\"). The number of zines grew with the development of video game journalism as writers like Arnie Katz and Chris Bieniek used their columns in mainstream magazines like \"Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment\", \"EGM\", and \"Tips &amp; Tricks\", to publish reviews of promising fanzines. These mainstream reviews had the effect of introducing fan editors to each other and of creating a fanzine scene.\nThe popularity of video game fanzines diminished greatly with the rise of the internet, however some zines\u2014particularly the classic gaming ones (e.g. \"Classic Gamer Magazine\" and \"Video Game Collector\")\u2014continued beyond the mid-90s. The rise of \"on demand\" publishing has led to a new outlet for print zines, like \"Jumpbutton\" and \"Scroll\".\nThe video game fanzine era was biggest in the US and Canada, but zines are also produced in other countries. Prominent video game fanzines produced in the UK include \"Retrogamer\", \"Pixel Nation\", \"Capcom Fanzine\", \"Mercury\", and \"Super Famicom Mini Mag\" among others. In France fanzines like \"Revival\" were circulated, and Japan has seen the production of lavish doujin works.\nMore recently, there has been a mini-resurgence in video game fanzines, with the launch of \"HyperPlay RPG\" in 2015 and \"Switch Player\" in 2017. Based in part on \"Super Play\"s focus on role-playing games and \"any-bit\" Nintendo, \"HyperPlay RPG\" received positive reviews by the mainstream video game media.\nWargaming.\nSeveral fanzines exist within the hobby of wargaming. Among them is \"Charge!\", a leading international fanzine exclusively for miniature wargaming enthusiasts for the American Civil War period. Other fanzines support Warhammer and other popular rules sets.\nSport.\nThe first association football fanzine is regarded as being Foul, a publication that ran between 1972 and 1976. In the UK, most Premier League or Football League football clubs have one or more fanzines which supplement, oppose and complement the club's official magazine or matchday programme. A reasonably priced 'zine has a guaranteed audience, as is the culture of passion in being a football fan.\nThe longest running fanzine is \"The City Gent\", produced by supporters of Bradford City FC, which first went on sale at Valley Parade in November 1984 and is now in its 26th season. Following close on its heels was Nike, Inc. which was first released in 1989. At the time it was not the first of its kind with \"Terrace Talk\" (York City), which was first published in November 1981 and \"Wanderers Worldwide\" (Bolton Wanderers) having already been established but since disappeared. In 1985 the emergent \"When Saturday Comes\" (a fanzine without a specific club focus that was subsequently launched as a mainstream magazine) promoted a 'fanzine movement' that gave birth to many more club titles during the late 1980s which was something of a glory period for fanzines.\nWith the widespread availability of the Internet, much of the energy that was put into football fanzines subsequently went into the development of supporters' websites. Examples of other UK football fanzines include \"A Love Supreme\" (Sunderland), \"TOOFIF\" (Fulham), \"The Square Ball\" (Leeds United), \"4,000 Holes\" (Blackburn Rovers) and \"War of the Monster Trucks\" (a Sheffield Wednesday fanzine named after a local TV station elected not to show the final scenes of an unlikely cup victory). The Queen's Park Rangers fanzine 'A Kick up the Rs' was first published in August 1987 and is still issuing an average of 10 issues per season.\nFanzines are not exclusive to the top tiers of football however, with Northern Counties East League side Scarborough Athletic FC having a fanzine titled \"Abandon Chip!\", a pun based on both the perilous situation of predecessor club Scarborough FC and that club's sponsors, McCain.\nAnd also away from the world of Football there were a number of established fanzines, for example Rugby league has such notable publications as \"Who The Hell Was St. George Anyway?\" Rugby League fanzine, by supporters of Doncaster RLFC and \"Scarlet Turkey\" of Salford City Reds.However, due to pressure from the Internet etc. these publications no longer exist in printed form. The title of World's longest running Rugby League fanzine now belongs to \"The Aye of the Tigers\", by Castleford Tigers supporters. The fanzine movement has even spread to the United States, where ice hockey fans have produced several popular fanzines. In Chicago two examples include the formerly published \"Blue Line Magazine\" and currently \"The Committed Indian\", both produced by Chicago Blackhawks fans. In St. Louis there are \"Game Night Revue\" and \"St Louis Game Time\" for the St. Louis Blues.\nThere are also a number of fanzines to be found in Ireland of which Shelbourne's \"Red Inc.\" is the longest running since 1999.\nIn the United States, sports fanzines are relatively rare. In Boston they are a bit more common. There are two fanzines sold outside Fenway Park including \"Yawkey Way Report\", which is run by a former Marine.\nRecent developments.\nWith the increasing availability of the Internet in the late 20th and the early 21st century, the traditional paper zine has begun to give way to the webzine (or \"e-zine\") that is easier to produce and uses the potential of the Internet to reach an ever-larger, possibly global, audience. Nonetheless, printed fanzines are still produced, either out of preference for the format or to reach people who do not have convenient Web access. Online versions of approximately 200 science fiction fanzines will be found at Bill Burns' eFanzines web site, along with links to other SF fanzine sites. In addition zine festivals are held each year in American cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn, as well as internationally in cities including Melbourne, Australia, and Glasgow, UK."}
{"id": "11102", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11102", "title": "Forgotten Futures", "text": "Forgotten Futures is a role-playing game created by Marcus Rowland to allow people to play in settings inspired by Victorian and Edwardian science fiction and fantasy (i.e., steampunk). Most of its releases begin with these stories then add background material to explain the settings (often as alternate worlds, whose history diverges from our own), adventures, and other game material.\nGame system.\nThe base system uses three characteristics (Body, Mind, and Soul) and a range of skills; points are used to purchase characteristics and skills based on one or more of the characteristics. Skills and characteristics are used by opposing them to a target (such as a difficulty number, an opponent's skill or characteristics, etc.) using a 2D6 dice roll. Subsequent revisions to the rules add options including a Magic characteristic, melodramatic character traits, and other complications, but the core system remains unchanged.\nRowland is believed to have pioneered the concept of shareware tabletop role-playing games with this system, although there were earlier shareware computer games with role-playing elements. Users can download the rules from his web site, buy a subscription that entitles them to Forgotten Futures CDs, or buy a copy of the published version of this game. The CDs are also good sources for science fiction books and other period material whose copyright has expired. A proportion of his income from the game is donated to cancer research charities.\nCurrently several versions of the rules are on line (complete and summary versions in HTML and PDF, and a German translation in PDF), along with a sample adventure set in a Victorian Channel Tunnel, plus eleven game collections (source material plus background worldbook, adventures, etc.), with an expanding collection of additional resources on line and on the CD-ROM. The rules and sample adventure have twice been published in print; in brief form as a booklet given away with \"Arcane Magazine\" in 1997, and at full length by Heliograph Inc. in 1999.\nIn May 2016 Rowland announced that due to delays in the next release and changes in European tax law he would end shareware distribution of the game. Instead he intends to put all of the existing material on line, including the full contents of the CD, with a tip jar for voluntary contributions, and hopes to add more material. Users with current shareware registrations were offered a partial refund or the option to donate it to Cancer Research UK.\nReception.\nIn the November 1994 edition of \"Pyramid\" (Issue #10), Ken &amp; Jo Walton liked both the content of \"Forgotten Futures 2\" and the shareware concept, saying, \"This is an excellent, atmospheric, roleplaying game, made slightly unapproachable by its unusual distribution method. It is available only on disk; you unzip the file and print out the book for yourself. All text files are ASCII format, all pictures are GIFs.\"\nIn the March 1998 edition of \"Dragon\" (Issue 245), Allen Varney, called \"Forgotten Futures\" \"A very substantial and admirable shareware RPG from one of Britain's top designers, based on the British 'scientific romances' popular a century ago.\" Varney also complimented Marcus Rowland for trying to keep those old 'scientific romance' stories in circulation, saying, \"Aside from the game's real virtues, this worthy mission makes \"Forgotten Futures\" a must for any fan of science fiction's early history.\""}
{"id": "11103", "revid": "38707965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11103", "title": "Fabritio Caroso", "text": "Fabritio Caroso da Sermoneta (1526/1535 \u2013 1605/1620) was an Italian Renaissance dancing master and a composer or transcriber of dance music.\nHis dance manual \"Il Ballarino\" was published in 1581, with a subsequent edition, significantly different, \"Nobilt\u00e0 di Dame\", printed in 1600 and again after his death in 1630. The work has been published in English as \"Courtly Dance of the Renaissance\" by Julia Sutton.\nBoth manuals have been printed in facsimile edition. Many of the dances of Fabritio Caroso's manuals are meant for two dancers with a few for four or more dancers. These manuals offer a great deal of information to dance historians and musicologists alike in that each description of a dance is accompanied by music examples with lute tablature and directions about how each music example is to be played. Many of the dances also contain dedications to noble women of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries."}

The President of the Palestinian Authority is a member of Fatah.\nFatah is generally considered to have had a strong involvement in revolutionary struggle in the past and has maintained a number of militant groups. Fatah had been closely identified with the leadership of its founder and Chairman Yasser Arafat, until his death in 2004, when Farouk Kaddoumi constitutionally succeeded him to the position of Fatah Chairman, and continued in the position until 2009, when Mahmoud Abbas was elected Chairman. Since Arafat's death, factionalism within the ideologically diverse movement has become more apparent.\nIn the 2006 election for the PLC, the party lost its majority in the PLC to Hamas. However, the Hamas legislative victory led to a conflict between Fatah and Hamas, with Fatah retaining control of the Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank through its president. Fatah is also active in the control of Palestinian refugee camps.\nEtymology.\nThe full name of the movement is \u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \"\u1e25arakat al-ta\u1e25r\u012br al-wa\u1e6dan\u012b al-Filas\u1e6d\u012bn\u012b\", meaning the \"Palestinian National Liberation Movement\". From this was crafted the reverse acronym \u0641\u062a\u062d \"Fat\u1e25\" (generally rendered in English as \"Fatah\") meaning \"opening\", \"conquering\", or \"victory\". The word \"fat\u1e25\" or \"fatah\" is used in religious discourse to signify the Islamic expansion in the first centuries of Islamic history\u00a0\u2013as in \"Fat\u1e25 al-Sham\", the \"conquering of the Levant\". \"Fatah\" also has religious significance in that it is the name of the 48th \"sura\" (chapter) of the Quran which, according to major Muslim commentators, details the story of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. During the peaceful two years after the Hudaybiyyah treaty, many converted to Islam, increasing the strength of the Muslim side. It was the breach of this treaty by the Quraysh that triggered the conquest of Mecca. This Islamic precedent was cited by Yasser Arafat as justification for his signing the Oslo Accords with Israel.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nThe Fatah movement was founded in 1959 by members of the Palestinian diaspora, principally by professionals working in the Persian Gulf States who had studied in Cairo or Beirut and had been refugees in Gaza. The founders included Yasser Arafat, then head of the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS) at Cairo University; Salah Khalaf; Khalil al-Wazir; and Khaled Yashruti, then GUPS head in Beirut. Fatah espoused a Palestinian nationalist ideology in which Palestinian Arabs would be liberated by their own actions.\n1967\u201393.\nFatah became the dominant force in Palestinian politics after the Six-Day War in 1967.\nFatah joined the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1967, and was allocated 33 of 105 seats in the PLO Executive Committee. Fatah's Yasser Arafat became Chairman of the PLO in 1969, after the position was ceded to him by Yahya Hammuda. According to the BBC, \"Mr Arafat took over as chairman of the executive committee of the PLO in 1969, a year that Fatah is recorded to have carried out 2,432 guerrilla attacks on Israel.\"\nBattle of Karameh.\nThroughout 1968, Fatah and other Palestinian armed groups were the target of a major Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) operation in the Jordanian village of Karameh, where the Fatah headquartersas well as a mid-sized Palestinian refugee campwere located. The town's name is the Arabic word for \"dignity\", which elevated its symbolism to the Arab people, especially after the Arab defeat in 1967. The operation was in response to attacks against Israel, including rockets strikes from Fatah and other Palestinian militias into the occupied West Bank. Knowledge of the operation was available well ahead of time, and the government of Jordan (as well as a number of Fatah commandos) informed Arafat of Israel's large-scale military preparations. Upon hearing the news, many guerrilla groups in the area, including George Habash's newly formed group the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Nayef Hawatmeh's breakaway organization the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), withdrew their forces from the town. Fatah leaders were advised by a pro-Fatah Jordanian divisional commander to withdraw their men and headquarters to nearby hills, but on Arafat's orders, Fatah remained, and the Jordanian Army agreed to back them if heavy fighting ensued.\nOn the night of 21 March, the IDF attacked Karameh with heavy weaponry, armored vehicles and fighter jets. Fatah held its ground, surprising the Israeli military. As Israel's forces intensified their campaign, the Jordanian Army became involved, causing the Israelis to retreat in order to avoid a full-scale war. By the end of the battle, nearly 150 Fatah militants had been killed, as well as twenty Jordanian soldiers and twenty-eight Israeli soldiers. Despite the higher Arab death toll, Fatah considered themselves victorious because of the Israeli army's rapid withdrawal.\nBlack September.\nIn the late 1960s, tensions between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly; heavily armed Arab resistance elements had created a virtual \"state within a state\" in Jordan, eventually controlling several strategic positions in that country. After their victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan. They set up roadblocks, publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces, molested women and levied illegal taxes \u2013 all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored.\nIn 1970, the Jordanian government moved to regain control over its territory, and the next day, King Hussein declared martial law. By 25 September, the Jordanian army achieved dominance in the fighting, and two days later Arafat and Hussein agreed to a series of ceasefires. The Jordanian army inflicted heavy casualties upon the Palestinians \u2013 including civilians \u2013 who suffered approximately 3,500 fatalities. Two thousand Fatah fighters managed to enter Syria. They crossed the border into Lebanon to join Fatah forces in that country, where they set up their new headquarters. A large group of guerrilla fighters led by Fatah field commander Abu Ali Iyad held out the Jordanian Army's offensive in the northern city of Ajlun until they were decisively defeated in July 1971. Abu Ali Iyad was executed and surviving members of his commando force formed the Black September Organization, a splinter group of Fatah. In November 1971, the group assassinated Jordanian prime minister Wasfi al-Tal as retaliation to Abu Ali Iyad's execution.\nIn the 1960s and the 1970s, Fatah provided training to a wide range of European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African militant and insurgent groups, and carried out numerous attacks against Israeli targets in Western Europe and the Middle East during the 1970s. Some militant groups that affiliated themselves to Fatah, and some of the \"fedayeen\" within Fatah itself, carried out civilian-aircraft hijackings and terrorist attacks, attributing them to Black September, Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council, Abu Musa's group, the PFLP, and the PFLP-GC. Fatah received weapons, explosives and training from the Soviet Union and some of the communist states of East Europe. China and Algeria also provided munitions. In 1979, Fatah aided Uganda during the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War. Members of the organization fought alongside the Uganda Army and Libyan troops against the Tanzania People's Defence Force during the Battle of Lukaya and the Fall of Kampala, but were eventually forced to retreat from the country.\nLebanon.\nSince the death of Eljamal in 1968, the Palestinian cause had a large base of supporters in Lebanon.\nAlthough hesitant at first to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah played an important role in the Lebanese Civil War. Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Fatah aligned itself with the communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement (LNM). Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside the Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM. The primary component of the Christian militias was the Maronite Phalangists.\nPhalangist forces killed twenty-six Fatah trainees on a bus in April 1975, marking the official start of the 15-year-long Lebanese civil war. Later that year, an alliance of Christian militias overran the Palestinian refugee camp of Karantina killing over 1,000 civilians. The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of Damour, a Phalangist and Tigers (Ahrar) stronghold, killing 684 civilians. As the civil war progressed over 2 years of urban warfare, both parties resorted to massive artillery duels and heavy use of sniper nests, while atrocities and war crimes were committed by both sides.\nIn 1976, with strategic planning help from the Lebanese Army, the alliance of Christian militias, spearheaded by the National Liberal Party of former President Cammille Chamoun militant branch, the noumour el ahrar (NLP Tigers), took a pivotal refugee camp in the Eastern part of Beirut, the Tel al-Zaatar camp, after a six-month siege, also known as Tel al-Zaatar massacre in which hundreds perished. Arafat and Abu Jihad blamed themselves for not successfully organizing a rescue effort.\nPLO cross-border raids against Israel grew somewhat during the late 1970s. One of the most severeknown as the Coastal Road massacreoccurred on 11 March 1978. A force of nearly a dozen Fatah fighters landed their boats near a major coastal road connecting the city of Haifa with Tel Aviv-Yafo. There they hijacked a bus and sprayed gunfire inside and at passing vehicles, killing thirty-seven civilians. In response, the IDF launched Operation Litani three days later, with the goal of taking control of Southern Lebanon up to the Litani River. The IDF achieved this goal, and Fatah withdrew to the north into Beirut.\nIsrael invaded Lebanon again in 1982. Beirut was soon besieged and bombarded by the IDF; to end the siege, the US and European governments brokered an agreement guaranteeing safe passage for Arafat and Fatahguarded by a multinational forceto exile in Tunis. Despite the exile, many Fatah commanders and fighters remained in Lebanon, and they faced the War of the Camps in the 1980s in their fight with the Shia Amal Movement and also in connection with internal schisms within the Palestinian factions.\nAfter 1993.\nPresidential and legislative elections.\nUntil his death, Arafat was the head of the Palestinian National Authority, the provisional entity created as a result of the Oslo Accords. Farouk Kaddoumi is the current Fatah chairman, elected to the post soon after Arafat's death in 2004.\nFatah nominated Mahmoud Abbas in the Palestinian presidential election of 2005.\nIn 2005, Hamas won in nearly all the municipalities it contested. Political analyst Salah Abdel-Shafi told the BBC about the difficulties of Fatah leadership: \"I think it's very, very seriousit's becoming obvious that they can't agree on anything.\" Fatah is \"widely seen as being in desperate need of reform,\" as \"the PA's performance has been a story of corruption and incompetenceand Fatah has been tainted.\"\nInternal discord.\nIn December 2005, jailed Intifada leader Marwan Barghouti broke ranks with the party and announced that he had formed a new political list to run in the elections called the \"al-Mustaqbal\" (\"The Future\"), mainly composed of members of Fatah's \"Young Guard.\" These younger leaders have repeatedly expressed frustration with the entrenched corruption in the party, which has been run by the \"Old Guard\" who returned from exile in Tunisia following the Oslo Accords. Al-Mustaqbal was to campaign against Fatah in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, presenting a list including Mohammed Dahlan, Kadoura Fares, Samir Mashharawi and Jibril Rajoub. However, on 28 December 2005, the leadership of the two factions agreed to submit a single list to voters, headed by Barghouti, who began actively campaigning for Fatah from his jail cell.\nThere have been numerous other expressions of discontent within Fatah, which is just holding its first general congress in two decades. Because of this, the movement remains largely dominated by aging cadres from the pre-Oslo era of Palestinian politics. Several of them gained their positions through the patronage of Yasser Arafat, who balanced above the different factions, and the era after his death in 2004 has seen increased infighting among these groups, who jockey for influence over future development, the political line, funds, and constituencies. The prospect of Abbas leaving power in the coming years has also exacerbated tensions.\nThere have been no open splits within the older generation of Fatah politicians since the 1980s, though there is occasional friction between members of the top leadership. One founding member, Faruq al-Qaddumi (Abu Lutf), continues to openly oppose the post-Oslo arrangements and has intensified his campaign for a more hardline position from exile in Tunis. Since Arafat's death, he is formally head of Fatah's political bureau and chairman, but his actual political following within Fatah appears limited. He has at times openly challenged the legitimacy of Abbas and harshly criticized both him and Mohammed Dahlan, but despite threats to splinter the movement, he remains in his position, and his challenges have so far been fruitless. Another influential veteran, Hani al-Hassan, has also openly criticized the present leadership.\nFatah's internal conflicts have also, due to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, merged with the turf wars between different PA security services, e.g., a longstanding rivalry between the West Bank (Jibril Rajoub) and Gaza (Muhammad Dahlan) branches of the powerful Preventive Security Service. Foreign backing for different factions contribute to conflict, e.g., with the United States generally seen as supportive of Abbas's overall leadership and of Dahlan's security influence, and Syria alleged to promote Faruq al-Qaddumi's challenge to the present leadership. The younger generations of Fatah, especially within the militant al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, have been more prone to splits, and a number of lesser networks in Gaza and the West Bank have established themselves as either independent organizations or joined Hamas. However, such overt breaks with the movement have still been rather uncommon, despite numerous rivalries inside and between competing local Fatah groups.\n2009 6th General Assembly.\nThe Sixth General Assembly of the Fatah Movement began on 4 August 2009 in Bethlehem, nearly 16 years after the Oslo I Accord and 20 years since the last Fatah convention, after being repeatedly postponed over conflicts ranging from who would be represented, to what venue would be acceptable. More than 2,000 delegates attended the meeting.\nThe internal dissension was immediately obvious. Saudi King Abdullah told Fatah delegates meeting in Bethlehem that divisions among the Palestinians were more damaging to their cause of an independent state than the Israeli \"enemy\".\nFatah delegates resolved not to resume Israeli-Palestinian peace talks until preconditions were met. Among the 14 preconditions were the release of all Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, freezing all Israeli settlement construction, and lifting the Gaza blockade.\nSome 400 Fatah members from the Gaza Strip were unable to attend the conference in Bethlehem after Hamas barred them from traveling to the West Bank.\nFatah was appealing to Palestinians who want a more hardline response to Israel by reaffirming its option for \"armed resistance\" against Israel.\nOfficials on the third day of the Fatah convention in Bethlehem unanimously accepted the proposal put forth by the chairman of the Araft Institute stating that Israel had been behind the \"assassination\" of the late Palestinian Authority Chairman and affirmed Fatah's request for international aid to probe the issue. Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel, Danny Ayalon, said the conference was a \"serious blow to peace\" and \"was another lost opportunity for the Palestinian leadership to adopt moderate views.\"\nElections to Central Committee and Revolutionary Council.\nOn 9 August 2009, new members of the Central Committee of Fatah and the Revolutionary Council were chosen. Delegates voted to fill 18 seats on the 23-seat Central Committee, and 81 seats on the 128-seat Revolutionary Council after a week of deliberations. At least 70 new members entered the latter, with 20 seats going to Fatah representatives from the Gaza Strip, 11 seats filled by women (the highest number of votes went to one woman who spent years in Israeli jails for her role in the resistance), four seats went to Christians, and one was filled by a Jewish-born convert to Islam, Uri Davis, the first Jewish-born person to be elected to the Revolutionary Council since its founding in 1958. Fatah activists from the Palestinian diaspora were also represented and included Samir Rifai, Fatah's secretary in Syria, and Khaled Abu Usba.\nElected to the central council was Fadwa Barghouti, the wife of Marwan Barghouti who was serving five life sentences in Israel for his role in terrorist attacks on civilians in Israel during the Second Intifada.\nReconciliation process with Hamas.\nA meeting of the Revolutionary Council was held in Ramallah from 18 to 19 October 2014. Many important questions were discussed, including reconciliation with Hamas. Opinion was divided on this issue.\n2016 7th Congress.\nIn December 2016, more than 1400 members of Fatah's 7th Congress elected 18 members of the Central Committee and 80 for the Revolutionary Council. Six new members were added to the Central Committee while 12 were reelected. Outgoing members included Nabil Shaath, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Zakaria al-Agha and Tayib Abdul Rahim.\nIdeology.\nFatah has \"Member Party\" status at the Socialist International and has \"Observer Party\" status within the Party of European Socialists.\nThe November 1959 edition of Fatah's underground journal \"Filastinuna Nida al-Hayat\" indicated that the movement was motivated by the status of the Palestinian refugees in the Arab world:\nFrom the beginning, the armed struggleas manifested in the 1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine and the military role of Palestinian fighters under the leadership of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni in the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli Warwas central to Fatah's ideology of liberating Palestine.\nStructure.\nFatah's two most important decision-making bodies are the Central Committee and Revolutionary Council. The Central Committee is mainly an executive body, while the Revolutionary Council is Fatah's legislative body.\nArmed factions.\nFatah has maintained a number of militant groups since its founding. Its mainstream military branch is al-'Asifah. Fatah is generally considered to have had a strong involvement in terrorism in the past, though unlike its rival Islamist faction Hamas, Fatah is no longer regarded as a terrorist organization by any government. Fatah used to be designated terrorist under Israeli law and was considered terrorist by the United States Department of State and United States Congress until it renounced terrorism in 1988.\nFatah has, since its inception, created, led or sponsored a number of armed groups and militias, some of which have had an official standing as the movement's armed wing, and some of which have not been publicly or even internally recognized as such. The group has also dominated various PLO and Palestinian Authority forces and security services which were/are not officially tied to Fatah, but in practice have served as wholly pro-Fatah armed units, and been staffed largely by members. The original name for Fatah's armed wing was al-'Asifah (\"The Storm\"), and this was also the name Fatah first used in its communiques, trying for some time to conceal its identity. This name has since been applied more generally to Fatah armed forces, and does not correspond to a single unit today. Other militant groups associated with Fatah include:\nDuring the Second Intifada, the group was a member of the Palestinian National and Islamic Forces.\nConstitution.\nIn August 2009, at Fatah's Sixth General Conference in Bethlehem, Fatah delegates drew up a new \"internal charter\"."}

Its Latin motto, \"\", translates to \"let there be bread\". It was founded in October 1945.\nThe FAO is composed of 197 member states. It is headquartered in Rome, Italy and maintains regional and field offices around the world, operating in over 130 countries. It helps governments and development agencies coordinate their activities to improve and develop agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and land and water resources. It also conducts research, provides technical assistance to projects, operates educational and training programs, and collects data on agricultural output, production, and development.\nThe FAO is governed by a biennial conference representing each member country and the European Union, which elects a 49-member executive council. The Director-General, currently Qu Dongyu of China, serves as the chief administrative officer. There are various committees governing matters such as finance, programs, agriculture, and fisheries. \nHistory.\nThe idea of an international organization for food and agriculture emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century, advanced primarily by Polish-born American agriculturalist and activist David Lubin. In May\u2013June 1905, an international conference was held in Rome, Italy, which led to the creation of the International Institute of Agriculture (IIA) by the King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III.\nThe IIA was the first intergovernmental organization to deal with the problems and challenges of agriculture on a global scale. It worked primarily to collect, compile, and publish data on agriculture, ranging from output statistics to a catalog of crop diseases. Among its achievements was the publication of the first agricultural census in 1930.\nWorld War II effectively ended the IIA. During the war, in 1943, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt called a United Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture, which brought representatives from forty-four governments to The Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia from 18 May to 3 June. The main impetus for the conference was British-born Australian economist Frank L. McDougall, who since 1935 had advocated for an international forum to address hunger and malnutrition.\nThe Conference ended with a commitment to establish a permanent organization for food and agriculture, which was achieved on 16 October 1945 in Quebec City, Canada, following the Constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization. The First Session of the FAO Conference was held immediately afterward in the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac in Quebec City from 16 October to 1 November 1945.\nAfter the war, the IIA was officially dissolved by resolution of its Permanent Committee on 27 February 1948. Its functions, facilities, and mandate were then transferred to the newly established FAO, which maintained its headquarters in Rome, Italy.\nThe FAO's initial functions supported agricultural and nutrition research and providing technical assistance to member countries to boost production in agriculture, fishery, and forestry. Beginning in the 1960s, it focused on efforts to develop high-yield strains of grain, eliminate protein deficiency, promote rural employment, and increases agricultural exports. To that end, it joined the UN General Assembly in creating the UN World Food Programme, the largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger and promoting food security.\nIn 1974, in response to famine in Africa, the FAO convened the first World Food Summit to address widespread hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity. The meeting resulted in a proclamation that \"every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition in order to develop their physical and mental faculties\", and a global commitment to eradicate these issues within a decade. A subsequent summit in 1996 addressed the shortcomings in achieving this goal while establishing a strategic plan for eliminating hunger and malnutrition into the 21st century.\nStructure and finance.\nIn 1951, the FAO's headquarters were moved from Washington, D.C., United States, to Rome, Italy. The agency is directed by the Conference of Member Nations, which meets every two years to review the work carried out by the organization and to Work and Budget for the next two-year period. The Conference elects a council of 49 member states (serve three-year rotating terms) that acts as an interim governing body, and the Director-General, who heads the agency.\nThe FAO is composed of eight departments: Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Climate, Biodiversity, Land and Water Department, Economic and Social Development, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Forestry, Corporate Services and Technical Cooperation and Programme Management.\nBeginning in 1994, the FAO underwent the most significant restructuring since its founding, to decentralize operations, streamline procedures and reduce costs. As a result, savings of about US$50 million, \u20ac43 million a year were realized.\nBudget.\nThe FAO's Regular Programme budget is funded by its members, through contributions set at the FAO Conference. This budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships including the Technical Cooperation Programme, knowledge exchange, policy and advocacy, direction and administration, governance and security.\nThe total FAO Budget planned for 2018\u20132019 is US$1,005.6 million. The voluntary contributions provided by members and other partners support mechanical and emergency (including rehabilitation) assistance to governments for clearly defined purposes linked to the results framework, as well as direct support to FAO's core work. The voluntary contributions are expected to reach approximately US$1.6 billion in 2016\u20132017.\nThis overall budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships, leading to Food and Agriculture Outcomes at 71 percent; Core Functions at 11 percent; the Country Office Network \u2013 5 percent; Capital and Security Expenditure \u2013 2 percent; Administration \u2013 6 percent; and Technical and Cooperation Program \u2013 5 percent.\nOffices.\nFAO headquarters.\nThe world headquarters are located in Rome, in the former seat of the Department of Italian East Africa. One of the most notable features of the building was the Axum Obelisk which stood in front of the agency seat, although just outside the territory allocated to FAO by the Italian Government. It was taken from Ethiopia by Benito Mussolini's troops in 1937 as a war chest, and returned on 18 April 2005.\nPartnership and Liaison Offices.\nPartnership and Liaison Offices provide for stronger country participation in FAO's work and programmes at national, subregional, regional and interregional levels as well as enhanced cooperation through unilateral trust fund projects and South-South Cooperation.\nPriority work areas.\nFAO has outlined the following priorities in its fight against hunger.\nTwo fundamental areas of work \u2013 gender and governance - are fully integrated in the above strategic objective action plans.\nProgrammes and achievements.\n\"Codex Alimentarius\".\nFAO and the World Health Organization created the Codex Alimentarius Commission in 1961 to develop food standards, guidelines and texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/ WHO Food Standards Programme. The main aims of the programme are protecting consumer health, ensuring fair trade and promoting co-ordination of all food standards work undertaken by intergovernmental and non-governmental organization.\nWorld Food Summit.\nIn 1996, FAO organized the World Food Summit, attended by 112 Heads or Deputy Heads of State and Government. The Summit concluded with the signing of the Rome Declaration, which established the goal of halving the number of people who suffer from hunger by the year 2015. At the same time, 1,200 civil society organizations (CSOs) from 80 countries participated in an NGO forum. The forum was critical of the growing industrialization of agriculture and called upon governments \u2013 and FAO \u2013 to do more to protect the 'Right to Food' of the poor.\nTeleFood.\nIn 1997, FAO launched TeleFood, a campaign of concerts, sporting events and other activities to harness the power of media, celebrities and concerned citizens to help fight hunger. Since its start, the campaign has generated close to US$28 million, \u20ac15 million in donations. Money raised through TeleFood pays for small, sustainable projects that help small-scale farmers produce more food for their families and communities.\nThe projects provide tangible resources, such as fishing equipment, seeds and agricultural implements. They vary enormously, from helping families raise pigs in Venezuela, through creating school gardens in Cape Verde and Mauritania or providing school lunches in Uganda and teaching children to grow food, to raising fish in a leper community in India.\nFAO Goodwill Ambassadors.\nThe FAO Goodwill Ambassadors Programme was initiated in 1999. It was created to increase public awareness and to disseminate information about issues related to food security and hunger in the world.\nRight to Food Guidelines.\nIn 2004 the Right to Food Guidelines were adopted, offering guidance to states on how to implement their obligations on the right to food.\nResponse to food crisis.\nIn December 2007, FAO launched its Initiative on Soaring Food Prices to help small producers raise their output and earn more. Under the initiative, FAO contributed to the work of the UN High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis, which produced the Comprehensive Framework for Action. FAO has carried out projects in over 25 countries and inter-agency missions in nearly 60, scaled up its monitoring through the Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, provided policy advice to governments while supporting their efforts to increase food production, and advocated for more investment in agriculture. s also worked hand-in-hand with the European Union. One example of its work is a US$10.2 million, \u20ac7.5 billion scheme to distribute and multiply quality seeds in Haiti, which has significantly increased food production, thereby providing cheaper food and boosting\nFAO\u2013EU partnership.\nIn May 2009, FAO and the European Union signed an initial aid package worth \u20ac125 million to support small farmers in countries hit hard by rising food prices. The aid package falls under the EU's \u20ac1 billion Food Facility, set up with the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis and FAO to focus on programmes that will have a quick but lasting impact on food security. FAO is receiving a total of around \u20ac200 million for work in 25 countries, of which \u20ac15.4 million goes to Zimbabwe.\nFood security programmes.\nThe Special Programme for Food Security is FAO's flagship initiative for reaching the goal of halving the number of hungry in the world by 2015 (currently estimated at close to 1 billion people), as part of its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. Through projects in over 100 countries worldwide, the programme promotes effective, tangible solutions to the elimination of hunger, undernourishment and poverty. Currently 102 countries are engaged in the programme and of these approximately 30 have begun shifting from pilot to national programmes. To maximize the impact of its work, FAO strongly promotes national ownership and local empowerment in the countries in which it operates.\nOnline campaign against hunger.\nThe 1billionhungry project became the EndingHunger campaign in April 2011. Spearheaded by FAO in partnership with other UN agencies and private nonprofit groups, the EndingHunger movement pushes the boundaries of conventional public advocacy. It builds on the success in 2010 of The 1billonhungry project and the subsequent chain of public events that led to the collection of over three million signatures on a global petition to end hunger (www.EndingHunger.org). The petition was originally presented to representatives of world governments at a ceremony in Rome on 30 November 2010.\nThe web and partnerships are two pivotal and dynamic aspects of EndingHunger. The campaign relies on the assistance of organizations and institutions that can facilitate the project's diffusion, by placing banners on their own websites or organizing events aimed to raise awareness of the project. In its 2011 season, the campaign expanded its multimedia content, pursued mutual visibility arrangements with partner organizations, and sharpened its focus on 14- to 25-year-olds, who were encouraged to understand their potential as a social movement to push for the end of hunger.\nMoreover, the EndingHunger project is a viral communication campaign, renewing and expanding its efforts to build the movement through Facebook, Twitter and other social networks. Those who sign the petition can spread the link of the EndingHunger website to their friends, via social media or mail, in order to gain awareness and signatures for the petition. The next interim objective is to grow the EndingHunger movement's Facebook community to 1 million members. As with the petition, the more people who get involved, the more powerful the message to governments: \"We are no longer willing to accept the fact that hundreds of millions live in chronic hunger.\" Groups and individuals can also decide on their own to organize an event about the project, simply by gathering friends, whistles, T-shirts and banners (whistles and T-shirts can be ordered, and petition sign sheets downloaded, on the endinghunger.org website) and thereby alert people about chronic hunger by using the yellow whistle.\nThe original 1billionhungry campaign borrowed as its slogan the line \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\", used by Peter Finch in the 1976 film, \"Network\". Meanwhile, the yellow whistle has been the campaign symbol from the start, from 1billionhungry to Ending Hunger. (The creative concept was provided by the McCann Erickson Italy Communication Agency.) It symbolizes the fact that we are \"blowing the whistle\" on the silent disaster of hunger. It is both a symbol and \u2013 at many live events taking place around the world \u2013 a physical means of expressing frustration and making some noise about the hunger situation.\nBoth The 1billionhungry and the EndingHunger campaigns have continued to attract UN Goodwill Ambassadors from the worlds of music and cinema, literature, sport, activism and government. Some of the well known individuals who have become involved include former Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, former presidents of Chile Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet, actress Susan Sarandon, actors Jeremy Irons and Raul Bova, singers C\u00e9line Dion and Anggun, authors Isabelle Allende and Andrea Camilleri, musician Chucho Vald\u00e9s and Olympic track-and-field legend Carl Lewis.\n75 years of the FAO.\nOver the past 75 years, the FAO's outlook and body of work have acquired new environmental and sustainability dimensions, with a strategic re-invention taking place in 2020. As the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates vulnerabilities linked to conflict and climate change and with only ten years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, there has been an emphasis on leveraging research partnerships, digitalization and innovation to help end hunger and malnutrition.\nAgriculture.\nInternational Plant Protection Convention.\nFAO created the International Plant Protection Convention or IPPC in 1952. This international treaty organization works to prevent the international spread of pests and plant diseases in both cultivated and wild plants. Among its functions are the maintenance of lists of plant pests, tracking of pest outbreaks, and coordination of technical assistance between member nations. As of July 2018, 183 contracting parties have ratified the treaty.\nPlant Treaty (ITPGRFA).\nFAO is depositary of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, also called \"Plant Treaty\", \"Seed Treaty\" or \"ITPGRFA\", entered into force on 29 June 2004.\nAlliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition.\nThe Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition (AAHM) aims to address how countries and organizations can be more effective in advocating and carrying out actions to address hunger and malnutrition. As a global partnership, AAHM creates global connections between local, regional, national and international institutions that share the goals of fighting hunger and malnutrition. The organization works to address food security by enhancing resources and knowledge sharing and strengthening hunger activities within countries and across state lines at the regional and international levels.\nFollowing the World Food Summit, the Alliance was initially created in 2002 as the 'International Alliance Against Hunger (IAAH)' to strengthen and coordinate national efforts in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. The mission of the Alliance originates from the first and eight UN Millennium Development Goals; reducing the number of people that suffer from hunger in half by 2015 (preceded by the \"Rome Declaration\" in 1996) and developing a global partnership for development. The Alliance was founded by the Rome-based food agencies \u2013 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), UN World Food Programme (WFP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), \u2013 and Bioversity International.\nAAHM connects top-down and bottom-up anti-hunger development initiatives, linking governments, UN organizations, and NGOs together in order to increase effectiveness through unity.\nIntegrated pest management.\nDuring the 1990s, FAO took a leading role in the promotion of integrated pest management for rice production in Asia. Hundreds of thousands of farmers were trained using an approach known as the Farmer Field School (FFS). Like many of the programmes managed by FAO, the funds for Farmer Field Schools came from bilateral Trust Funds, with Australia, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland acting as the leading donors. FAO's efforts in this area have drawn praise from NGOs that have otherwise criticized much of the work of the organization.\nTransboundary pests and diseases.\nFAO established an \"Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases\" in 1994, focusing on the control of diseases like rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease and avian flu by helping governments coordinate their responses. One key element is the \"Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme\", which has advanced to a stage where large tracts of Asia and Africa have now been free of the cattle disease rinderpest for an extended period of time. Meanwhile, \"Locust Watch\" monitors the worldwide locust situation and keeps affected countries and donors informed of expected developments.\nGlobal Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building.\nThe Global Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building (GIPB) is a global partnership dedicated to increasing plant breeding capacity building. The mission of GIPB is to enhance the capacity of developing countries to improve crops for food security and sustainable development through better plant breeding and delivery systems. The ultimate goal is to ensure that a critical mass of plant breeders, leaders, managers and technicians, donors and partners are linked together through an effective global network.\nIncreasing capacity building for plant breeding in developing countries is critical for the achievement of meaningful results in poverty and hunger reduction and to reverse the current worrisome trends. Plant breeding is a well recognized science capable of widening the genetic and adaptability base of cropping systems, by combining conventional selection techniques and modern technologies. It is essential to face and prevent the recurrence of crises such as that\nof the soaring food prices and to respond to the increasing demands for crop based sources of energy.\nInvestment in agriculture.\nFAO's technical cooperation department hosts an Investment Centre that promotes greater investment in agriculture and rural development by helping developing countries identify and formulate sustainable agricultural policies, programmes and projects. It mobilizes funding from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, regional development banks and international funds as well as FAO resources.\nGlobally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS).\nThe Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) Partnership Initiative was conceptualized and presented by Parviz Koohafkan the Task Manager of Chapter 10 of Agenda 21 in Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations, FAO in 2002 during World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa. This UN Partnership Initiative aims to identify, support and safeguard Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems and their livelihoods, agricultural and associated biodiversity, landscapes, knowledge systems and cultures around the world. The GIAHS Partnership recognizes the crucial importance of the well-being of family farming communities in an integrated approach while directing activities towards sustainable agriculture and rural development.\nCommission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA).\nThe Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was established in 1983 and provides a unique intergovernmental forum that specifically addresses biological diversity for food and agriculture. Its main objective is to ensure the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from its use, for present and future generations.http://www.fao.org/cgrfa/en/\nAnimal Genetic Resources.\nFAO has a unit focused on Animal Genetic Resources, which are defined as \"those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.\" FAO assists countries in implementation of the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources. FAO supports a variety of \"ex situ\" and \"in situ\" conservation strategies including cryoconservation of animal genetic resources.\nForestry.\nOne of FAO's strategic goals is the sustainable management of the world's forests. The \"Forestry Department\" works to balance social and environmental considerations with the economic needs of rural populations living in forest areas. FAO serves as a neutral forum for policy dialogue, as a reliable source of information on forests and trees and as a provider of expert technical assistance and advice to help countries develop and implement effective national forest programmes.\nFAO is both a global clearinghouse for information on forests and forest resources and a facilitator that helps build countries' local capacity to provide their own national forest data. In collaboration with member countries, FAO carries out periodic global assessments of forest resources, which are made available through reports, publications and the FAO's Web site. The \"Global Forest Resources Assessment\" provides comprehensive reporting on forests worldwide every five years. FRA 2015 is the most recent global assessment. The results, data and analyses are available online in different formats, including the FAO synthesis report \"Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: How are forests changing?\", the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 Desk Reference containing summary tables, 234 country reports and the FRA 2015 Infographics. Moreover, in 2015, the journal \"Forest Ecology and Management\" published a special issue, \"Changes in Global Forest Resources from 1990 to 2015\" reporting forest change over the period 1990\u20132015.\nEvery two years, FAO publishes the \"State of the World's Forests\", a major report covering current and emerging issues facing the forestry sector.\nSince 1947, FAO has published the FAO Yearbook of Forest Products, a compilation of statistical data on basic forest products from over 100 countries and territories of the world. It contains data on the volume of production; and the volume, value and direction of trade in forest products.\n\"Unasylva\", FAO's peer-reviewed journal on forestry, has been published in English, French and Spanish on a regular basis since 1947, the longest-running multilingual forestry journal in the world.\nThe FAO is an official sponsor of International Day of Forests, on 21 March each year, as proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on 28 November 2012.\nEvery 6 years since 1926, FAO and a host member state hold the World Forestry Congress. It is a forum for the sharing of knowledge and experience regarding the conservation, management and use of the world's forests, and covers such issues as international dialogue, socio-economic and institutional aspects, and forest policies.\nThe Forestry Department is also organized geographically in several groups covering the whole world's forest ecosystems. One of them is the Silva mediterranea workgroup, covering the pan-mediterranean region.\nTree Cities of the World.\nAt the World Forum on Urban Forests in October 2018, the FAO and the Arbor Day Foundation jointly launched the Tree Cities of the World programme. The aim of this programme is to celebrate and recognize cities and towns of all sizes throughout the world which have shown a commitment to maintaining their urban forests. From the end of 2019, any municipality which has responsibility for its trees were able to apply to join Tree Cities of the World. On 4 February 2020, 59 cities were announced as having achieved the designation of Tree City of the World. There were 27 in the United States, with the rest scattered across the world.\nFisheries.\nThe FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department is defined through its vision and mission statements:\nThe work of the Fisheries and Aquaculture Department centers on the \"Sustainable management and use of fisheries and aquaculture resource,\" embracing normative as well as operational activities, whether implemented from headquarters or from the field.\nStatistics.\nESSG is an acronym for the Global Statistics Service, the major \"section\" of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization - Statistics Division. It is responsible for updating and disseminating the FAOSTAT report. This offers free and easy access to data for 245 countries and 35 regional areas from 1961 through the most recent year available. Enhanced features include browsing and analysis of data, an advanced interactive data download, and enhanced data exchange through web services.\nThe Land and Water Division maintains a database of global water statistics, Aquastat.\nFlagship publications.\nEvery year, FAO publishes a number of major \u2018State of the World\u2019 reports related to food, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and natural resources.\nMembership.\nThere are a total of 197 members: 194 member nations, 1 member organization and 2 associate members.\nThe only UN member state that is a non-member of the FAO is Liechtenstein.\nBoth UN observer states are also non-members of the FAO: the Holy See (Vatican City) and Palestine.\nSome countries may denote specific representatives to the FAO, for instance the United States Ambassador to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, who has ambassador rank and is also a part of the United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome.\nCriticism.\n1970s, 80s, 90s.\nThere has been public criticism of FAO for at least 30 years. Dissatisfaction with the organization's performance was among the reasons for the creation of two new organizations after the World Food Conference in 1974, namely the World Food Council and the International Fund for Agricultural Development; by the early eighties there was intense rivalry among these organizations. At the same time, the World Food Programme, which started as an experimental three-year programme under FAO, was growing in size and independence, with the Directors of FAO and WFP struggling for power.\nEarly in 1989, the organization came under attack from Heritage Foundation, an American conservative think tank, which described the FAO as becoming \"essentially irrelevant in combating hunger\" due to a \"bloated bureaucracy known for the mediocrity of its work and the inefficiency of its staff\", which had become politicized. In September of the same year, the journal \"Society\" published a series of articles about FAO that included a contribution from the Heritage Foundation and a response by FAO staff member, Richard Lydiker, who was later described by the Danish Minister for Agriculture (who had herself resigned from the organization) as \"FAO's chief spokesman for non-transparency\".\nEdouard Saouma, the Director-General of FAO, was also criticized in Graham Hancock's book \"Lords of Poverty\", published in 1989. Mention is made of Saouma's \"fat pay packet\", his \"autocratic\" management style, and his \"control over the flow of public information\". Hancock concluded that \"One gets the sense from all of this of an institution that has lost its way, departed from its purely humanitarian and developmental mandate, become confused about its place in the world \u2013 about exactly what it is doing, and why.\" Despite the criticism, Edouard Saouma served as DG for three consecutive terms from 1976 to 1993.\nIn 1990, the U.S. State Department expressed the view that \"The Food and Agriculture Organization has lagged behind other UN organizations in responding to US desires for improvements in program and budget processes to enhance value for money spent\".\nA year later, in 1991, \"The Ecologist\" magazine produced a special issue under the heading \"The UN Food and Agriculture Organization: Promoting World Hunger\". The magazine included articles that questioned FAO's policies and practices in forestry, fisheries, aquaculture, and pest control. The articles were written by experts such as Helena Norberg-Hodge, Vandana Shiva, Edward Goldsmith, Miguel A. Altieri and Barbara Dinham.\n2000s.\nThe 2002 Food Summit organized by FAO was considered to have been ineffectual and unproductive by the official participants. Social movements, farmers, fisherfolk, pastoralists, indigenous peoples, environmentalists, women's organizations, trade unions and NGOs expressed their \"collective disappointment in, and rejection of the official Declaration of the\u00a0... Summit\".\nIn 2004, FAO produced a controversial report called 'Agricultural Biotechnology: meeting the needs of the poor?', which claimed that \"agricultural biotechnology has real potential as a new tool in the war on hunger\". In response to the report, more than 650 organizations from around the world signed an open letter in which they said \"FAO has broken its commitment to civil society and peasants' organisations\". The letter complained that organizations representing the interests of farmers had not been consulted, that FAO was siding with the biotechnology industry and, consequently, that the report \"raises serious questions about the independence and intellectual integrity of an important United Nations agency\". The Director General of FAO responded immediately, stating that decisions on biotechnology must \"be taken at the international level by competent bodies\" (in other words, not by non-governmental organizations). He acknowledged, however, that \"biotechnology research is essentially driven by the world's top ten transnational corporations\" and \"the private sector protects its results with patents in order to earn from its investment and it concentrates on products that have no relevance to food in developing countries\".\nIn May 2006, a British newspaper published the resignation letter of Louise Fresco, one of eight Assistant Directors-General of FAO. In her letter, Fresco stated that \"the Organization has been unable to adapt to a new era\", that its \"contribution and reputation have declined steadily\" and \"its leadership has not proposed bold options to overcome this crisis\".\nThe 32nd Session of FAO's Committee on World Food Security in 2006, attended by 120 countries, was widely criticized by non-governmental organizations, but largely ignored by the mainstream media. Oxfam called for an end to the talk-fests while Via Campesina issued a statement that criticised FAO's policy of Food Security.\nOn 18 October 2007, the final report of an Independent External Evaluation of FAO was published. More than 400 pages in length, the evaluation was the first of its kind in the history of the Organization. It had been commissioned by decision of the 33rd Session of the FAO Conference in November 2005. The report concluded that \"The Organization is today in a financial and programme crisis\" but \"the problems affecting the Organization today can all be solved\". Among the problems noted by the IEE were: \"The Organization has been conservative and slow to adapt\"; \"FAO currently has a heavy and costly bureaucracy\", and \"The capacity of the Organization is declining and many of its core competencies are now imperilled\". Among the solutions offered were: \"A new Strategic Framework\", \"institutional culture change and reform of administrative and management systems\". In conclusion the IEE stated that, \"If FAO did not exist it would need to be invented\".\nThe official response from FAO came on 29 October 2007. It indicated that management supported the principal conclusion in the report of the IEE on the need for \"reform with growth\" so as to have an FAO \"fit for this century\". Meanwhile, hundreds of FAO staff signed a petition in support of the IEE recommendations, calling for \"a radical shift in management culture and spirit, depoliticization of appointments, restoration of trust between staff and management, [and] setting strategic priorities of the organization\".\nIn November 2008, a Special Conference of FAO member countries agreed a US$42.6 million (\u20ac38.6 million), three-year Immediate Plan of Action for \"reform with growth\", as recommended by the IEE. Under the plan US$21.8 million would be spent on overhauling the financial procedures, hierarchies and human resources management.\nIn 2015, the FAO was criticized by \"The Economist\" for giving a diploma to Venezuela for being one of 72 countries that had \"reached the UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the percentage of their populations suffering from hunger\". It argued that the positive conclusion reached by FAO about the performance of a country experiencing major economic difficulties was based on false statistics and that the percentage of the Venezuelan population suffering from hunger had actually increased. It quoted FAO as saying that it had no reason to doubt the Venezuelan statistics.\nIn 2016/17 FAO was heavily criticized for recruiting Nadine Heredia Alarc\u00f3n de Humala, wife of the former president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, to a senior position, at a time when she was being investigated by Peru following corruption allegations. Critics included Transparency International.\nAt the end of April 2017, FAO staff unions addressed the organization's Governing Council to complain about the practice of issuing short-term contracts that \"exploit employees without providing job security, social security and paid leave\". Other complaints included the increasing centralization of management processes, despite claims that FAO was being decentralized, and the failure to follow United Nations recommendations regarding increasing the retirement age. The staff representative also complained about the high percentage of unfilled positions, increasing the workload for others who were under pressure to deliver more with less. She also noted that contacts between Management and the staff bodies were becoming less and less frequent.\nFrom 2013, an English-language newspaper based in Rome, \"The Italian Insider\", made several allegations of nepotism and corruption within FAO and reported on poor management-staff relations. In June 2018, FAO and four of its officials took the paper and its editor, John Philips, to court alleging defamation, using a law dating back to the fascist era in Italy. Reporters Without Borders condemned \"the disproportionate nature of the defamation proceedings\", for which the newspaper was liable for a fine of up to Euros 100,000 and the editor at least three years in prison. The case was adjourned until January 2019, when it was further adjourned until May 2019. The January hearing was considered by the British satirical magazine \"Private Eye\" to have been \"one of the more surreal courtroom scenes in modern times\", involving dispute as to the meaning of an English slang word used by the \"Insider\".\nWorld food crisis.\nIn May 2008, while talking about the ongoing world food crisis, President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal expressed the opinion that FAO was \"a waste of money\" and that \"we must scrap it\". Wade said that FAO was itself largely to blame for the price rises, and that the organization's work was duplicated by other bodies that operated more efficiently, like the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development. However, this criticism may have had more to do with personal animosity between the President and the Director-General, himself a Senegalese, particularly in light of the significant differences in the work carried out by the two organizations.\nIn 2008, the FAO sponsored the High-Level Conference on World Food Security. The summit was notable for the lack of agreement over the issue of biofuels.\nThe response to the summit among non-governmental organizations was mixed, with Oxfam stating that \"the summit in Rome was an important first step in tackling the food crisis but greater action is now needed\", while Maryam Rahmanian of Iran's Centre for Sustainable Development said \"We are dismayed and disgusted to see the food crisis used to further the policies that have led us to the food crisis in the first place\". As with previous food summits, civil society organizations held a parallel meeting and issued their own declaration to \"reject the corporate industrial and energy-intensive model of production and consumption that is the basis of continuing crises.\"\nFAO renewal.\nThe FAO Conference in November 2007 unanimously welcomed the IEE report and established a Conference Committee for the Follow-up to the Independent External Evaluation of FAO (CoC-IEE) to be chaired by the Independent Chairperson of Council, and open to full participation by all Members. The CoC-IEE was charged to review the IEE report and its recommendations and develop an Immediate Plan of Action (IPA) for their implementation.\nA comprehensive programme of organizational reform and culture change began in 2008 after the release of an Independent External Evaluation. Headquarters restructuring and delegation of decision making created a flatter more responsive structure and reduced costs. Modernizing and streamlining of administrative and operational processes took place. Improved internal teamwork and closer external partnerships coupled with upgrading of IT infrastructure and greater autonomy of FAO's decentralized offices now allows the Organization to respond quickly where needs are greatest. As FAO is primarily a knowledge based organization, investing in human resources is a top priority. Capacity building including a leadership programme, employee rotation and a new junior professional programme were established. Individual performance management, an ethics and ombudsman officer and an independent office of evaluation were designed to improve performance through learning and strengthened oversight.\nIn January 2012, the Director-General Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva acted upon the commitment made during his campaign to bring the FAO reform to a successful and anticipated completion. In addition, the new Director-General shifted the focus of the reform process to realization of its benefits and mainstreaming the reform into the work of the Organization.\nIn July 2020, the FAO Council approved a series of measures proposed by its Director-General Qu Dongyu to modernize the organisation and make it more efficient and effective. An important element within the approved measures is the adoption \"of a more flexible organizational structure, aimed at ensuring agility, optimal cross-sectoral collaboration and better responses to emerging needs and priorities\"."}

{"id": "11109", "revid": "1012070672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11109", "title": "F\u00e9lix Guattari", "text": "Pierre-F\u00e9lix Guattari (; ; April 30, 1930 \u2013 August 29, 1992) was a French psychotherapist, philosopher, semiologist, activist and screenwriter. He founded both schizoanalysis and ecosophy, and is best known for his intellectual collaborations with Gilles Deleuze, most notably \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972) and \"A Thousand Plateaus\" (1980), the two volumes of \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\".\nBiography.\nClinic of La Borde.\nGuattari was born in Villeneuve-les-Sablons, a working-class suburb of north-west Paris, France. He trained under (and was analysed by) the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan in the early 1950s. Subsequently, he worked all his life at the experimental psychiatric clinic of La Borde under the direction of Lacan's pupil, the psychiatrist Jean Oury. La Borde was a venue for conversation among many students of philosophy, psychology, ethnology, and social work.\nOne particularly novel orientation developed at La Borde consisted of the suspension of the classical analyst/analysand pair in favour of an open confrontation in group therapy. In contrast to the Freudian school's individualistic style of analysis, this practice studied the dynamics of several subjects in complex interaction; it led Guattari into a broader philosophical exploration of, and political engagement with, a vast array of intellectual and cultural domains (philosophy, ethnology, linguistics, architecture, etc.).\n1960s to 1970s.\nFrom 1955 to 1965, Guattari edited and contributed to \"La Voie Communiste\" (\"Communist Way\"), a Trotskyist newspaper. He supported anti-colonialist struggles as well as the Italian Autonomists. Guattari also took part in the G.T.P.S.I., which gathered many psychiatrists at the beginning of the sixties and created the Association of Institutional Psychotherapy in November 1965. It was at the same time that he founded, along with other militants, the F.G.E.R.I. (Federation of Groups for Institutional Study &amp; Research) and its review \"Recherche\" (\"Research\"), working on philosophy, mathematics, psychoanalysis, education, architecture, ethnology, etc. The F.G.E.R.I. came to represent aspects of the multiple political and cultural engagements of Guattari: the Group for Young Hispanics, the Franco-Chinese Friendships (in the times of the people's communes), the opposition activities with the wars in Algeria and Vietnam, the participation in the M.N.E.F., with the U.N.E.F., the policy of the offices of psychological academic aid (B.A.P.U.), the organisation of the University Working Groups (G.T.U.), but also the reorganizations of the training courses with the Centers of Training to the Methods of Education Activities (C.E.M.E.A.) for psychiatric male nurses, as well as the formation of a Fellowship of Nurses (Amicales d'infirmiers) (in 1958), the studies on architecture and the projects of construction of a day hospital for \"students and young workers\".\nIn 1967, he appeared as one of the founders of OSARLA (Organization of solidarity and Aid to the Latin-American Revolution). In 1968, Guattari met Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Jean-Jacques Lebel, and Julian Beck. He was involved in the large-scale French protests of 1968, starting from the Movement of March 22. It was in the aftermath of 1968 that Guattari met Gilles Deleuze at the University of Vincennes and began to lay the ground-work for \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972), which Michel Foucault described as \"an introduction to the non-fascist life\" in his preface to the book. In 1970, he created ), which developed the approach explored in the \"Recherches\" journal. In 1973, Guattari was tried and fined for committing an \"outrage to public decency\" for publishing an issue of \"Recherches\" on homosexuality. In 1977, he created the CINEL for \"new spaces of freedom\" before joining in the 1980s the environmental movement with his \"ecosophy\".\n1980s to 1990s.\nIn his last book, \"Chaosmosis\" (1992), Guattari returned to the question of subjectivity: \"How to produce it, collect it, enrich it, reinvent it permanently in order to make it compatible with mutant Universes of value?\" This concern runs through all of his works, from \"Psychoanalysis and Transversality\" (a collection of articles from 1957 to 1972), through \"Years of Winter\" (1980\u20131986) and \"Schizoanalytic Cartographies\" (1989), to his collaboration with Deleuze, \"What is Philosophy?\" (1991). In \"Chaosmosis\", Guattari proposes an analysis of subjectivity in terms of four functors: (1) material, energetic, and semiotic fluxes; (2) concrete and abstract machinic phyla; (3) virtual universes of value; and (4) finite existential territories. This scheme attempts to grasp the heterogeneity of components involved in the production of subjectivity, as Guattari understands it, which include both signifying semiotic components as well as \"a-signifying semiological dimensions\" (which work \"in parallel or independently of\" any signifying function that they may have).\nOn 29 August 1992, two weeks after an interview for Greek television, curated by Yiorgos Veltsos, Guattari died in La Borde from a heart attack. \nIn 1995, the posthumous release of Guattari's \"Chaosophy\" published essays and interviews concerning Guattari's work as director of the experimental La Borde clinic and his collaborations with Deleuze. The collection includes essays such as \"Balance-Sheet Program for Desiring Machines,\" cosigned by Deleuze (with whom he coauthored \"Anti-Oedipus\" and \"A Thousand Plateaus\"), and \"Everybody Wants To Be a Fascist.\" It provides an introduction to Guattari's theories on \"schizoanalysis\", a process that develops Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis but which pursues a more experimental and collective approach towards analysis.\nIn 1996, another collection of Guattari's essays, lectures, and interviews, \"Soft Subversions\", was published, which traces the development of his thought and activity throughout the 1980s (\"the winter years\"). His analyses of art, cinema, youth culture, economics, and power formations, develop concepts such as \"micropolitics,\" \"schizoanalysis,\" and \"becoming-woman,\" which aim to liberate subjectivity and open up new horizons for political and creative resistance to the standardizing and homogenizing processes of global capitalism (which he calls \"Integrated World Capitalism\") in the \"postmedia era.\" For example, he used the term \"micropolitics\" to delimit a certain level of observation of social practices (the unconscious economy, where there is a certain flexibility in the expression of desire and institution) and, practically, to define, in a segregated world, the field of intervention of \"people who work to interest themselves in the discourse of the other.\"\nWorks.\nUntranslated works.\nNote: Many of the essays found in these works have been individually translated and can be found in the English collections.\nOther collaborations:"}
