He was the first emperor of the House of Habsburg, and the fourth member of the House of Habsburg to be elected King of Germany after Rudolf I of Germany, Albert I in the 13th century and his predecessor Albert II of Germany. He was the penultimate emperor to be crowned by the Pope, and the last to be crowned in Rome.\nPrior to his imperial coronation, he was duke of the Inner Austrian lands of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola from 1424, and also acted as regent over the Duchy of Austria (as Frederick V) from 1439. He was elected and crowned King of Germany (as Frederick IV) in 1440. He was the longest-reigning German monarch when in 1493, after ruling his domains for more than 53 years, he was succeeded by his son Maximilian I.\nDuring his reign, Frederick concentrated on re-uniting the Habsburg \"hereditary lands\" of Austria and took a lesser interest in Imperial affairs. Nevertheless, by his dynastic entitlement to Hungary as well as by the Burgundian inheritance, he laid the foundations for the later Habsburg Empire. Mocked as \"Arch-Sleepyhead of the Holy Roman Empire\" () during his lifetime, he is today increasingly seen as an effective ruler.\nEarly life.\nBorn at the Tyrolean residence of Innsbruck in 1415, Frederick was the eldest son of the Inner Austrian duke Ernest the Iron, a member of the Leopoldian line of the Habsburg dynasty, and his second wife Cymburgis of Masovia. According to the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, the Leopoldinian branch ruled over the duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, or what was referred to as Inner Austria. Only three of Frederick's eight siblings survived childhood: his younger brother Albert (later to be Albert VI, archduke of Austria), and his sisters Margaret (later the electress of Saxony) and Catherine. In 1424, nine-year-old Frederick's father died, making Frederick the duke of Inner Austria, as Frederick V, with his uncle, Duke Frederick IV of Tyrol, acting as regent.\nFrom 1431, Frederick tried to obtain majority (to be declared \"of age\", and thus allowed to rule) but for several years was denied by his relatives. Finally, in 1435, Albert V, duke of Austria (later Albert II, the king of Germany), awarded him the rule over his Inner Austrian heritage. Almost from the beginning, Frederick's younger brother Albert asserted his rights as a co-ruler, as the beginning of a long rivalry. Already in these years, Frederick had begun to use the symbolic A.E.I.O.U. signature as a kind of motto with various meanings. In 1436 he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, accompanied by numerous nobles knighted by the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, which earned him great reputation.\nUpon the death of his uncle Duke Frederick IV in 1439, Frederick took over the regency of Tyrol and Further Austria for the duke's heir Sigismund. Again he had to ward off the claims raised by his brother Albert VI; he prevailed by the support of the Tyrolean aristocracy. Likewise he acted as regent for his nephew Ladislaus the Posthumous, son of late King Albert II and his consort Elizabeth of Luxembourg, in the duchy of Austria (Further Austria). (Ladislaus would die before coming of age). Frederick was now the undisputed head of the Habsburg dynasty, though his regency in the lands of the Albertinian Line (Further Austria) was still viewed with suspicion.\nAs a cousin of late King Albert II, Frederick became a candidate for the imperial election. On 2 February 1440, the prince-electors convened at Frankfurt and unanimously elected him King of the Romans as Frederick IV; his rule was still based on his hereditary lands of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, or Inner Austria.\nIn 1442, Frederick allied himself with Rudolf St\u00fcssi, burgomaster of Zurich, against the Old Swiss Confederacy in the Old Zurich War (Alter Z\u00fcrichkrieg) but lost. In 1448, he entered into the Concordat of Vienna with the Holy See, which remained in force until 1806 and regulated the relationship between the Habsburgs and the Holy See.\nIn 1452, at the age of 37, Frederick III travelled to Italy to receive his bride and to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor. His fianc\u00e9e, the 18-year-old \"infanta\" Eleanor, daughter of King Edward of Portugal, landed at Livorno (Leghorn) after a 104-day trip. Her dowry would help Frederick alleviate his debts and cement his power. The couple met at Siena on 24 February and proceeded together to Rome. As per tradition, they spent a night outside the walls of Rome before entering the city on 9 March, where Frederick and Pope Nicholas V exchanged friendly greetings. Because the emperor had been unable to retrieve the Iron Crown of Lombardy from the cathedral of Monza where it was kept, nor be crowned King of Italy by the archbishop of Milan (on account of Frederick's dispute with Francesco Sforza, lord of Milan), he convinced the pope to crown him as such with the German crown, which had been brought for the purpose. This coronation took place on the morning of 16 March, in spite of the protests of the Milanese ambassadors, and in the afternoon Frederick and Eleanor were married by the pope. Finally, on 19 March, Frederick and Eleanor were anointed in St Peter's Basilica by the Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, Cardinal Francesco Condulmer, and Frederick was then crowned with the Imperial Crown by the pope. Frederick was the last Emperor to be crowned in Rome; his great-grandson Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned, but this was done in Bologna.\nPersonality.\nFrederick's style of rulership was marked by hesitation and a sluggish pace of decision making. The Italian humanist Enea Silvio Piccolomini, later Pope Pius II, who at one time worked at Frederick's court, described the Emperor as a person who wanted to conquer the world while remaining seated. Although this was regarded as a character flaw in older academic research, his delaying tactics are now viewed as a means of coping with political challenges in far-flung territorial possessions. Frederick is credited with having the ability to sit out difficult political situations patiently.\nAccording to contemporary accounts, Frederick had difficulties developing emotional closeness to other persons, including his children and wife Eleanor. In general, Frederick kept himself away from women, the reasons for which are not known. As Frederick was rather distant to his family, Eleanor had a great influence on the raising and education of Frederick's children, and she therefore played an important role in the House of Habsburg's rise to prominence. Despite the fact that their marriage had been unhappy, when Eleanor died the Emperor was affected by her loss and remained widowed for the rest of his long life.\nEmperor.\nFrederick's political initiatives were hardly bold, but they were still successful. Frederick III was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1452, following the death of his father. His ascension to the role of emperor came with the stipulation that should the previous queen give birth to a male heir, Frederick would become his guardian. When the queen gave birth to Ladislaus the Posthumous, as according to the stipulations, Frederick took on his guardianship. This led to conflicts between Frederick and other members of the royal family and nobility. His first major opponent was his brother Albert VI, who challenged his rule. He did not manage to win a single conflict on the battlefield against him, and thus resorted to more subtle means. He held his second cousin once removed Ladislaus the Posthumous, the ruler of the Archduchy of Austria, Hungary and Bohemia, (born in 1440) as a prisoner and attempted to extend his guardianship over him in perpetuity to maintain his control over Lower Austria. Ladislaus was freed in 1452 by the Lower Austrian estates. He acted similarly towards his first cousin Sigismund of the Tyrolian line of the Habsburg family. Despite those efforts, he failed to gain control over Hungary and Bohemia in the Bohemian\u2013Hungarian War (1468\u201378) and was even defeated in the Austrian\u2013Hungarian War (1477\u201388) by the Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus in 1485, who managed to maintain residence in Vienna until his death five years later in the Siege of Vienna.\nUltimately, Frederick prevailed in all those conflicts by outliving his opponents and sometimes inheriting their lands, as was the case with Ladislaus, from whom he gained Lower Austria in 1457, and with his brother Albert VI, whom he succeeded in Upper Austria. In 1462, his brother Albert raised an insurrection against him in Vienna and the emperor was besieged in his residence by rebellious subjects. In this war between the brothers, Frederick received support from the King of Bohemia, George of Pod\u011bbrady. These conflicts forced him into an anachronistic itinerant existence, as he had to move his court between various places through the years, residing in Graz, Linz and . owes him its castle and the \"New Monastery\". In 1469 Friedrich founded the Order of St. George, which still exists today, whereby the first investiture in the Lateran Basilica in Rome was carried out by him and Pope Paul II.\nMary soon made her choice among the many suitors for her hand by selecting Archduke Maximilian of Austria, the future Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, who became her co-ruler. With the inheritance of Burgundy, the House of Habsburg began to rise to predominance in Europe. This gave rise to the saying \"Let others wage wars, but you, happy Austria, shall marry\", which became a motto of the dynasty.\nFrederick secured in 1486 the succession of the son in his own lifetime. On 16 February 1486 Maximilian was unanimously elected Roman-German king at the Frankfurt Reichstag by the six electors present. The Elector of Bohemia was not invited because the Bohemian spa law might have been claimed by the Hungarian King Corvinus. The choice of Maximilian violated the rules of the Golden Bull. Protests against the irregular election remained in the kingdom but out. Fearing that the Electors would take advantage of his son's political inexperience, Friedrich Maximilian did not equip him with government powers. On the occasion of the election of Maximilian, a ten-year land peace was decided. In order to safeguard the peace of the land and against the expansive territorial policy of the Wittelsbachs, numerous affected empire-related states of Swabia joined in 1488 on Frederick's initiative for the Swabian League. After the royal election Frederick accompanied his son to Aachen, where Maximilian was crowned on 9 April 1486.\nThe marriage of his daughter Kunigunde to Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria, was another result of intrigues and deception, but must be counted as a defeat for Frederick. Albert illegally took control of some imperial fiefs and then asked to marry Kunigunde (who lived in Innsbruck, far from her father), offering to give her the fiefs as a dower. Frederick agreed at first, but after Albert took over yet another fief, Regensburg, Frederick withdrew his consent. On 2 January 1487, however, before Frederick's change of heart could be communicated to his daughter, Kunigunde married Albert. A war was prevented only through the mediation of the Emperor's son, Maximilian.\nIn some smaller matters, Frederick was quite successful: in 1469 he managed to establish bishoprics in Vienna and , a step that no previous Duke of Austria had been able to achieve.\nFrederick's personal motto was the mysterious string A.E.I.O.U., which he imprinted on all his belongings. He never explained its meaning, leading to many different interpretations being presented, although it has been claimed that shortly before his death he said it stands for ' or ' (\"All the world is subject to Austria\"). It may well symbolise his own understanding of the historical importance and meaning of his rule and of the early gaining of the Imperial title.\nMarriage and children.\nFrederick had five children from his marriage with Eleanor of Portugal:\nFor the last 10 years of Frederick's life, he and Maximilian ruled jointly.\nDeath.\nIn his last years Friedrich remained in the region on the Danube, in Vienna and in Linz. In 1492 he was elected Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Since February 1493, Frederick's health deteriorated increasingly. In the Lent of 1493, Friedrich's personal physicians diagnosed Kaiser in the left leg as a symptom, usually referred to as age-burning, in the research literature, which according to current medical terminology is considered to be the result of arteriosclerosis. On 8 June 1493 he was amputated under the direction of the surgeon Hans Seyff in the Linz castle of the affected area of the leg. This leg amputation is considered one of the most famous and best-documented surgical procedures of the entire Middle Ages. Although Frederick initially survived the procedure well, he died on 19 August 1493 in Linz at the age of 77. The contemporaries cited as the cause of death the consequences of leg amputation, senility or rapid diarrhea caused by melon consumption. His bowels were probably buried separately on 24 August 1493 in the Linz parish church. The arrival of Turks in Carinthia and the Krain delayed the arrival of Maximilian and with it the funeral service. On 6 and 7 December 1493, the funeral took place in St. Stephen's Cathedral. \nHis grave, built by Nikolaus Gerhaert von Leyden, in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, is one of the most important works of sculptural art of the late Middle Ages. (His amputated leg was buried with him.) The heavily adorned tomb was not completed until 1513, two decades after Frederick's death, and has survived in its original condition."}

{"id": "11475", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11475", "title": "Fuerteventura", "text": "Fuerteventura () is one of the Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean and is part of the North Africa region, politically part of Spain. At , it is the second largest of the Canary Islands, after Tenerife. As at the start of 2019, Fuerteventura had 116,886 inhabitants. It was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in May 2009. Its capital is Puerto del Rosario.\nEtymology.\nThe island's name is a compound word formed by the Spanish words for \"strong\" (fuerte) and \"fortune\" (ventura). Traditionally, Fuerteventura's name has been regarded as a reference to the strong winds around the island and the resulting danger to nautical adventurers. However, it might have referred instead (or also) to wealth, luck or destiny.\nIn 1339 the Mallorcan navigator Angelino Dulcert, in the \"Planisferio de Angelino Dulcert]], referred to the island as \"Forte Ventura\".\nAnother theory is that the island's name derives from \"Fortunatae Insulae\" (Fortunate Islands), the name by which the Romans knew the Canary Islands.\nThe indigenous name of the island, before its conquest in the 15th century, was Erbania, divided into two regions (Jand\u00eda and Maxorata), from which the name majorero (originally majo or maxo) derives. However, it has been suggested that, at some point, Maxorata (which meant \"the children of the country\") was the aboriginal toponym of the entire island.\nHistory.\nPrecolonial history.\nThe first settlers of Fuerteventura are believed to have come from North Africa. The word \"Mahorero\" (\"Majorero\") or \"Maho\" is still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura and is derived from the ancient word 'mahos', a type of goatskin shoe worn by these original inhabitants. They lived in caves and semi-subterranean dwellings, some of which have been excavated, revealing remnants of early tools and pottery. In antiquity, the island was known o.a. as \"Planaria\", in reference to the flatness of most of its terrain.\nPhoenician settlers landed in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.\nSeveral Spanish and Portuguese expeditions to the islands were organized around 1340, followed by Moors and European slave traders. At the end of the Iberian conquest, the island was divided into two Guanches kingdoms, one adhering to King Guize and the other to King Ayoze. The territories of these kingdoms were called Maxorata (in the North) and Jand\u00eda (in the South) respectively. They were separated by a wall, which traversed the La Pared isthmus. Some remains have been preserved. The ancient name for the island, Erbania, is derived from this wall's name.\nThe conquest.\nThe island's conquest began in earnest in 1402, commanded by French knights and crusaders Jean de B\u00e9thencourt and Gadifer de la Salle. They arrived with only 63 sailors out of the original 283, as many had deserted along the way. After arriving and settling in Lanzarote, the invaders made some first excursions to the neighboring islands. In 1404, Bethencourt and Gadifer founded Betancuria, on the West coast, the first settlement on the island. After numerous difficulties, Gadifer took charge of the invasion, while Bethencourt returned to Spain to seek the recognition and support of the Castilian king.\nIn 1405, de B\u00e9thencourt completed his conquest of the island, establishing its capital in Betancuria (Puerto Rosario took over the mantle as island capital in 1835).\nIn 1424 Pope Martin V, through the Betancuria Brief, edicted the establishment of the Bishopric of Fuerteventura, which encompassed all the Canary Islands save for the island of Lanzarote. The origin of this bishopric is directly related to the events that occurred after the Great Schism (1378\u20131417), in that the bishop of San Marcial del Rubic\u00f3n of Lanzarote (at the time, the only diocese in the Canary Islands) did not recognize the papacy of Martin V, and instead adhered to anti-Pope Benedict XIII. The \"Bishopric of Fuerteventura\" was based in the \"Parish of Santa Mar\u00eda de Betancuria\", bestowing upon the latter the status of Grant Cathedral. After the reabsorbtion of the \"Diocese of San Marcial del Rubic\u00f3n\" by the papacy of Pope of Martin V, the Bishopric of Fuerteventura was abolished in 1431, only seven years after it was created.\nThe first census recorded a population of some 1,200 inhabitants. The population increased gradually thereafter. In 1476 the territory became the \"Se\u00f1or\u00edo Territorial de Fuerteventura\", subjected to the Catholic Monarchs. In later years, the island was invaded by the Spanish, French and the English.\n2nd conquest of Fuerteventura.\nOver time, the island endured numerous pirate raids. A Berber-led expedition invaded in 1593, sweeping as far inland as the capital. Various castles were built along the coastline, to protect against these type of attacks. The population was moved inland as a second protective measure. Because of the raids, a first \"Captain General\" was dispatched to Fuerteventura, accompanied by a number of \"Sergeant Majors\", to defend the island in the name of the Crown. At that time Betancuria became the religious capital of the island.\nTwo major pirate attacks took place in 1740, within a month of each other. Two separate bands of English privateers attempted to loot the town of Tuineje. These attacks were however successfully averted by the local population and the island's militia. This successful repelling of the invaders is celebrated at a re-enactment that takes place in Gran Tarajal every year in October.\nThe island's garrison was officially instated in 1708. Its colonel assumed the title of \"Governor at Arms\", a hereditary, lifelong appointment which has remained in the S\u00e1nchez-Dumpi\u00e9rrez family. In time, this family increasingly garnered power over the other islands through alliances with the family of Arias de Saavedra and the Lady of Fuerteventura. During the same year the \"Assistant Parish of La Oliva and P\u00e1jara\" was created, to become operational in 1711. On 17 December 1790 the \"Assistant Parish of Tuineje\" was created, which became a new parish division on 23 June 1792 under the bishop Tavira, with lands including part of the Jand\u00eda peninsular, and with a population of 1,670 inhabitants. 1780 saw the start of a barrilla plantation industry.\nTo the present.\nIn 1852, a free trade zone was extended by Isabella II to the Canary Islands. Military island rule, which began in 1708, was finally dissolved in 1859, and Puerto de Cabras (now Puerto del Rosario) became the new capital.\nThe Canary Islands obtained self-governance in 1912. In 1927, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote became part of the province of Gran Canaria. The seat of the island's government (\"cabildo insular\") is located in Puerto del Rosario. A total of 118,574 people lived on the island in 2018.\nBy the 1940s the island had an airport (just west of Puerto del Rosario on the road to Tindaya, still visible today). Mass tourism began to arrive in the mid-1960s, facilitated by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral and the first tourist hotels.\nThe island's proximity (a mere 100\u00a0km) to the West African coast and the fact that it is part of the Schengen territory make it a prime target destination for undocumented immigrants. However, many have perished while attempting the crossing.\nFlag of Fuerteventura.\nThe flag of Fuerteventura is in proportions 1:2, divided vertically, green to the hoist and white to the fly end, with the coat of arms of the island in the centre.\nCoat of Arms.\nThe coat of arms of Fuerteventura was prescribed by a Decree adopted on 15 October 1998 by the Government of the Canary Islands and published on 11 November 1998 in the official gazette of the Canary Islands, No. 142, pp.\u00a013,432\u201313,433. It was adopted on 24 April 1998 by the Island Council and validated on 18 September 1998 by the Heraldry Commission of the Canary Islands.\nThe heraldic description is \"per pale and per fess. First, gules, a castle or, masoned sable, its gate and windows azure. \nSecond, argent, lion gules, crowned, armed and langued or. Third, silver, three fesses chequy gules and or, in four rows, each one charged with a fess or. \nBordure gules, with eight saltires or. Ensigned with a royal crown, open.\"\nAccording to Jos\u00e9 Manuel Erbez (Banderas y escudos de Canarias, 2007), the coat of arms is based on the arms of the island's provincial militia. \nThe upper quarters represent Castile (symbolized by a castle) and Le\u00f3n (symbolized by a lion). The lower quarter alludes to the Saavedra family; various members of this family were lords of Fuerteventura.\nGeography.\nEnvironment.\nThe elongated island has an area of . The island is long and wide. It is part of the province of Las Palmas. It is divided into six municipalities:\n100 individual settlements are distributed through these municipalities. A nearby islet, Islote de Lobos, is part of the municipality of La Oliva.\nLocated just off the coast of North Africa, it is the second biggest of the islands, after Tenerife, and has the longest white sand beaches in the archipelago. The island is a destination for sun, beach and watersports enthusiasts. It lies at the same latitude as Florida and Mexico and temperatures rarely fall below or rise above . It counts 152 separate beaches along its seaboard \u2014 of white sand and of black volcanic shingle.\nThe highest point in Fuerteventura is Pico de la Zarza (807 m) in the southwestern part of the island. Geographical features include Istmo de la Pared which is wide and is the narrowest part of Fuerteventura. The island is divided into two parts, the northern portion which is Maxorata and the southwestern part called the Jand\u00eda peninsula.\nClimate.\nThe climate on Fuerteventura is pleasant throughout the year. The island is hence referred to as \"the island of eternal spring\". The sea regulates air temperature, diverting hot Sahara winds away from the island. The island's name in English translates as \"strong fortune\" or \"strong wind\", the Spanish word for wind being \"viento\". During the winter months, temperatures average a high of and a low of around , whereas during the summer a mean high of and a low of can be expected. Precipitation is about per year, most of which falls in autumn and winter. December is the month with highest rainfall.\nA sandstorm known as the Calima (similar to the Sirocco wind, which blows to the North of the Sahara, to Europe) may blow from the Sahara Desert to the Northwest, and can cause high temperatures, low visibility and drying air. Temperatures during this phenomenon rise temporarily by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The wind brings in fine red dust, The fine white sand is not blown in from Sahara, It is made up of dead coral reef and local seabed upheaval. visibility can drop to between or even lower, and together with very warm temperatures, it can even bring African locusts to the island.\nHydrology.\nIn the winter months, up to 80% of the rainwater flows unused into the ocean, as there is no vegetation to capture the water (also due to overgrazing by free-ranging goats near the coast).\nThe mountain forests, which were still present in the 19th century, were all chopped down. \nInstead, there are many desalination plants (running on electricity) which produce the required amount of freshwater on the island. The tourists on the island use about double the amount of water as the native inhabitants of Fuerteventura. Causes are the filling of swimming pools, watering hotel gardens and washing towels, ...\nGeology.\nFuerteventura is the oldest island in the Canary Islands dating back 20 million years to a volcanic eruption from the Canary hotspot. The majority of the island was created about 5 million years ago and since then has been eroded by wind and precipitation. On the seabed off the West coast of the island rests an enormous slab of bedrock long and wide, which appears to have slid off the island largely intact at some point in prehistory, similar to the predicted future collapse of Cumbre Vieja, a geological fault on another Canary Island, La Palma. The last volcanic activity in Fuerteventura occurred between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago.\nBeaches.\nFuerteventura was chosen among 500 European destinations by the Quality Coast International Certification Program of the European Coastal and Marine Union as one of the most attractive tourist destinations for visitors interested in cultural heritage, environment and sustainability. The best beaches to visit are Playas de Corralejo, Playa de Ajuy, Playa de Cofete and Playas de El Cotillo.\nWildlife.\nThe island is home to one of the two surviving populations of the threatened Canarian Egyptian vulture. It is also inhabited by many wild dogs and cats. On the barren, rocky land there are Barbary ground squirrels and geckos. Fuerteventura also hosts several migratory and nesting birds. The island has significant populations of the collared dove, common swifts and several finch species especially in the vicinity of holiday developments.\nDespite its arid climate, the island is also home to a surprisingly large insect fauna. Butterflies which commonly occur on the island include the clouded yellow (\"Colias hyale\") and the bath white (\"Pontia daplidice\") which feeds on xerophytic cruciferae. The island is also home to the monarch butterfly (\"Danaus plexippus\") and its close African relative \"Danaus chrysippus\". Around holiday developments such as Caleta de Fuste, water is relatively abundant, and dragonfly species including the blue emperor (\"Anax imperator\") and the scarlet darter (\"Crocothemis erythraea\") can be found. The island's sand dunes and shoreline are home to a number of bee and wasp species including the large eumenid caterpillar hunting wasp, \"Delta dimidiatipenne\" and the blue banded bee, (\"Amegilla canifrons\").\nHawkmoths also occur on the island. One of the more notable species is \"Hyles tithymali\" which feeds on endemic spurges such as \"Euphorbia regis-jubae\". \"Acherontia atropos\", the deaths-head hawkmoth also occurs on the island presumably feeding on members of the Solanaceae, for example, \"Datura innoxia\" and \"Nicotiana glauca\" which are common weeds in the vicinity of human habitation.\nNatural symbols.\nThe official natural symbols associated with Fuerteventura are \"Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae\" (hubara or houbara) and \"Euphorbia handiensis\" (Card\u00f3n de Jand\u00eda).\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\nThe island has a population of 116,886. Throughout its long history, Fuerteventura has suffered from a population decline due to the economic situation and the climate, which have made it into a desert island. However, the development of tourism during the 1980s has caused the population to grow year on year since then, doubling it in a little less than a decade.\nIn 2005, with 86,642 registered inhabitants, the Fuerteventura population was formed by the following:\nComparing this data with the 2001 census shows that the number of permanent residents born on the island has increased by just 3,000. The number who have moved in from abroad has increased by 22,910, making this the biggest contributor to population growth in recent years.\nEducation.\nThe island has 116 schools, with a total of 14,337 pupils. Of these, 45 are primary schools, ten are secondary schools, six are for Baccalaureate students and four are vocational colleges.\nFuerteventura also has a centre linked with the National University of Distance Education, offering courses in many subjects including economics, business studies, law, history and tourism.\nState administration.\nFuerteventura is governed by the Island Department of the Government of Spain, which holds the rank of a Government Subdepartment. The government building is located in the centre of the capital city.\nThis institution is charged with representing the Government of Spain on the island, and managing all the functions that are not under control of the Canarian Government. This includes the following public services:\nSince 30 June 2007, the island's governor has been Eustaquio Juan Santana Gil. 4\nIsland Council of Fuerteventura (Cabildo).\nThe councils, formed as part of the Councils Act of 1912, administer the Canary Islands and have two principal functions. On one hand, they perform services for the Autonomous Community, and on the other, they are the local government centre for the island. In the 2003 elections, Mario Cabrera Gonz\u00e1lez was elected as president representing the Canarian Coalition, with 31.02% of the votes, followed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party with 27.53%, represented by the Vice President Domingo Fuentes Curbelo.\nMunicipalities.\nThe island is divided into six municipalities with their respective city councils which form part of the FECAM (Federation of Canarian Municipalities). They are governed by the basic legislation of the local regime and their respective organic rules. The populations of the municipalities are as follows:\nIn turn, these municipalities are organised into two associations: the \"Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Norte de Fuerteventura\" formed from La Oliva and Puerto del Rosario, and the remaining municipalities make up the \"Mancomunidad de Municipios del Centro-Sur de Fuerteventura\".\nEconomy.\nBoth Fuerteventura and Lanzarote would be the main exporters of wheat and cereals to the central islands of the archipelago during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries; Tenerife and Gran Canaria. Although this trade almost never reversed in the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote (due to the fact that the landowners of these islands profited from this activity), producing periods of famine, so the population of these islands He had to travel to Tenerife and Gran Canaria to try to improve his luck. Being the island of Tenerife as the main focus of attraction for the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, hence the feeling of union that has always existed in the popular sphere with Tenerife.\nThe economy of Fuerteventura is mainly based on tourism. Primary tourist areas are located around the existing towns of Corralejo in the north and Morro Jable in Jandia, plus the purely tourist development of Caleta de Fuste, south of Puerto del Rosario. Other main industries are fishing and agriculture (cereals and vegetables). The famous Majorero cheese is locally made from the milk of the indigenous majorera goat.\nIn 2009, Fuerteventura recorded the highest EU regional unemployment rate at a NUTS3 level, at 29.2 percent.\nTourism.\nThe first tourist hotel was built in 1965 followed by the construction of Fuerteventura Airport at El Matorral, heralding the dawn of a new era for the island. Fuerteventura, with its 3,000 sunshine hours a year, was placed firmly on the world stage as a major European holiday destination.\nWhile having fully developed tourist facilities, the island has not experienced the overdevelopment found on some other islands. Nonetheless, it remains a destination for predominantly but not exclusively European tourists.\nThe summer Trade Winds and winter swells of the Atlantic make this a year-round surfers' paradise, with more exposed areas on the north and west shores such as Corralejo and El Cotillo proving most popular. Wind surfing takes places at locations around the island. Sailors, scuba divers and big-game fishermen are all drawn to these clear blue Atlantic waters where whales, dolphins, marlin and turtles are all common sights. With many hills present throughout the Island, hikers are also attracted to this Island.\nExcellent sandy beaches are found in many locations. Western beaches, such as those around El Cotillo, can experience strong surf. The beaches adjoining the extensive sand dunes east of Corralejo are popular, as are the more protected extensive sandy shores of the Playa de Sotavento de Jandia on the southeastern coast between Costa Calma and the Morro Jable. Naked sun bathing and swimming are the norm almost on all beaches.\nMuch of the interior, with its large plains, lavascapes and volcanic mountains, consists of protected areas, although there are organised tours and vehicular access across them.\nArt and culture.\nTraditional holidays.\nLike the rest of the Canaries, Carnival is traditionally one of the biggest festivals celebrated on the island. It is celebrated in different ways in all the towns during February and March. These festivities have a different theme each year. They include activities such as parades and galas to choose the carnival king.\nConcerts and festivals.\nThere are many concerts and festivals held in the auditoriums, such as the Festival of Canarian Music. They are also held in smaller venues across the island, featuring bands such as Estopa, Van Gogh's Ear, and King Afrhica.\nFestival Internacional de Cometas/International Kite Festival is held on the second week of November each year centering on the Corralejo Beaches. It attracts kitefliers and kite surfers from all over Europe. It is popular because the winds are warm and constant and the beaches become filled with hundreds of colourful kites of all shapes and sizes.\nAuditoriums.\nFuerteventura has three auditoriums. These are used for all types of performing art. They are also used for non-artistic purposes, such as conferences, charity galas and political meetings.\nCentral library.\nThe Central Library of the Island is located in Antigua's city centre, in the public university. In addition to providing the traditional library services, it has a 180-seat multipurpose room, air conditioning, a wifi zone, and a multimedia room used for seminars, presentations, film festivals etc.\nMuseums and exhibition spaces.\nThe island has several museums with different themes and plenty of exhibition spaces, both public and private. These include:\nSculpture park.\nIn addition to the museums, the capital Puerto del Rosario has an open-air sculpture park consisting of around 100 sculptures by different artists scattered across the city. Most of them were created for the International Symposium of Sculpture celebrated annually since 2001. During the festival, artists come from all over the world to erect their sculptures in the open air, in full view of passers by.\nMain sights.\nSites of interest include Corralejo and El Jable to the north which are made up of fine sand dunes whilst the south is filled with long beaches and remote bays. The constant winds blowing onto the beaches provide a paradise for windsurfing. Surfing is common on the west and north coasts where there are large waves. Windsurfing is common around Corralejo and Playas de Sotavento and wave sailing (windsurfing on the waves) on the coast along the northern half of the island. El Cotillo is a small fishing village in the north-west of the Island famous for a very long beach to the south of the village and few very calm beaches to the north. The northern beaches frequented by snorkeling enthusiasts and sun worshippers alike are referred to as lakes by the locals. \nAt Cofete on the western side of Jand\u00eda a remote and imposing house \u2013 Villa Winter \u2013 looks out to sea across wide beaches. It was reputedly built by a Mr Winter on land given by Generalisimo Franco.\nFor a time, the beaches were home to a popular accidental attraction. On 18 January 1994 the United States Lines ocean liner SS \"American Star\" (former \"America\", USS \"West Point\", \"Australis\") was beached in Playa de Garcey during a severe storm. Within a year, she broke in two and later lost her stern. By 2007 the rest of the severely deteriorated ship had collapsed onto her port side, gradually keeling over further and almost completely submerged. By 2008\u20132012, most of the remains finally slipped below the surface.\nFood.\nThe cuisine is fairly basic due to the customs and climate conditions. They share this simplicity with the other Canary islands, and similarly to them, they use a large quantity of fish. They also use whatever they can grow in the near-barren land. This includes papas arrugadas, a dish of wrinkled potatoes usually served with mojo, which is a hot pepper sauce or with puchero canario, a meat stew.\nSeafood is prepared in many ways traditionally, such as pejines (salted fish), jareas, or sancocho (a type of stew) made from fish, generally the grouper, corvina or sama, boiled after salting, and served with mojo, potatoes, or gofio (a type of grain). People are also very keen on the mussels and limpets collected on the island's coasts.\nThey also use meat such as beef and pork to make different dishes or simply to for braising, but their main meat is goat, both from the kids and from the older animals. They eat the goat roasted or stewed. Goats are not only useful for their meat \u2013 the Fuerteventurans also use the milk to make the cheese majorero, which has won many prizes. The majorero is mostly made of goats milk, and occasionally it is up to 15% ewes milk. It is cured in pimento oil or gofio meal. Majorero and palmero cheese are the only two Canarian cheeses with protected denomination of origin.\nSport.\nMany sports are commonly played in Fuerteventura, both in the open air and in sports centres across the island.\nNative sports.\nThese are the Canarian sports found on the island:\nCanarian wrestling.\nThe wrestling takes place in a ring of sand called the \"terrero\". Inside it, the two contestants try to knock each other over. Fuerteventura has 14 terreros distributed through all the towns except Betancuria.\nThe island also has a school wrestling league organized by the council and a programme to promote this sport in clubs. Twelve wrestling schools participate in this, based in Antigua, Costa Calma, El Matorral, La Lajita, Lajares, Las Playitas, Morro Jable, Puerto del Rosario, Tef\u00eda, Tetir, Uni\u00f3n Sur and Villaverde.\nJuego del Palo.\nJuego del Palo is a Canarian martial art which literally translates as \"game of the stick\". It is played by two players both armed with sticks. They aim to defeat each other without making contact with their opponent's body. The origin of this game is unclear. All we know is that it is based on a method of combat used by the precolonial Canarian people.\nFuerteventura has the following Palo clubs:\nCanarian boules.\nThis is a similar game to the French P\u00e9tanque which is actually played very little on the island, although there are a few teams and courts. Basically the game consists of scoring points by throwing a ball to get it as near as possible to an object called a \"mingue\" or \"boliche\". It is played on a rectangular sand or earth pitch which is long and wide.\nSimple Petanque Rules -\nWatersports.\nThe sea and climate conditions make the island the perfect place for a huge variety of watersports.\nSurfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing.\nMany types of surfing are popular on the island, including traditional surfing, windsurfing (where the board is propelled by a sail) and most recently kitesurfing. The island has many schools and courses dedicated to teaching these sports.\nThe sports where Fuerteventura has the most impact internationally are windsurfing and kitesurfing, mainly due to the International Windsurfing and Kiteboarding Championship. This has run since 1985 and is held at Playas de Sotavento in P\u00e1jara municipality. Many important wind and kitesurfing figures compete in this championship, such as the several-times world windsurfing champion Bj\u00f6rn Dunkerbeck and Gisela Pulido, the very young kiteboarding champion from Tarifa.\nMany Canarian windsurfers are on the Canarian Waveriders circuit, which has been based in Corralejo since 2005.\nDiving.\nDiving schools are just as frequent as surfing ones, all around the coast of Fuerteventura. Unlike the other islands of the archipelago, Fuerteventura has a shelf which at some points goes up to , making it an ideal place to practice this sport.\nTwo of the most useful points for diving are the coast off Playa del Matorral in the South, and the zone between Lobos Island and Corralejo in the north. It is here in Corralejo that the International Sea and Submarine Photography Festival takes places, known as Fimarsub Corralejo \u2013 Lobos. During the festival there are beginners' lessons, professional dives, lessons in underwater photography, screenings and other events related to the sport.\nSwimming.\nThere are many swimming pools on the island but the most obvious place to swim is in the open sea. There is an annual swim from Lobos Island to Fuerteventura, held every year since 1999. The event attracts amateur swimmers from all over the Canaries and Spain, and also swimming professionals such as David Meca and Maarten van der Weijden, the paralympist Jes\u00fas Collado Alarc\u00f3n who won gold medals for 100m backstroke and butterfly in Athens 2004, and Xavi Torres Ramis, the paralympic champion in Barcelona 1992, Sydney and Atlanta.\nSailing.\nThe island holds competitions involving different types of boat, such as the lateen and the Optimist. An interesting event is the Tour of Fuerteventura by Kayak, which is organised as a series of stages rather than a competition, and is an easy way to explore the island.\nFishing.\nThe most notable competition here is the Gran Tarajal Fishing Open.\nOther sports.\nSince 2004 the Marcha Ciclotourista has been held in La Oliva and the Criterium Ciclista has been held in Corralejo (also part of the La Oliva municipality) since 2005. Participants include , T-Mobile and a team from Orbea. These competitions have contributed to local interest in the sport and the first professional local team, the Fuerteventura-Canarias, was formed, initially run by \u00d3scar Guerrero, director of Kaiku, although they have not competed for the past few seasons.\nThere are various motocross circuits on the island, including \"Los Alares\" in Antigua and \"Isla de Fuerteventura\" in Puerto del Rosario municipality. They hold regular trials, some of which form part of the Canarian Regional Motocross Championship. Throughout the year there are gravel rally races. Two are part of the Canarian Dirt Rally Championship. These are the Antiguan Rally and the La Oliva Rally.\nThe island's main football clubs are CD Union Puerto and CD Cotillo, who play in Group XII of the Spanish Tercera Divisi\u00f3n.\nThe resort Playitas on the south coast is since around 2008 equipped with a swimming pool and has become a destination for triathlon training camps for Europeans. An annual race called Challenge Fuerteventura is held there on the half ironman distance."}

About 7.4% of families and 9.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.8% of those under age 18 and 7.8% of those age 65 or over.\nHistory.\nThe Fairmount area was settled in the 1830s mostly by Quakers from North Carolina. The town was laid out in 1850 and named for Fairmount Park in Philadelphia; it was formally incorporated in 1870.\nAfter a large deposit of natural gas was found in 1887, Fairmount became part of the Indiana Gas Boom and a center of the glass industry for the rest of the 19th century. Shortly after the depletion of the gas in 1900 the automobile industry set up factories in the nearby large cities, and Fairmount became a bedroom community, restoring some of its lost prosperity.\nIn the 1940s, James Dean lived with an aunt and uncle, Ortense and Marcus Winslow, on a farm north of Fairmount. He attended Fairmount High School, graduating in 1949. After his death in 1955, Dean was buried in Park Cemetery. In 1996, a small Memorial Park north of the town's business district was dedicated in his memory with a bronze bust by Hollywood artist Kenneth Kendall.\nDuring the prosperity of the 1960s, Fairmount enjoyed a time of building with a new town hall, water works, post office and elementary school. At the end of the decade the local school district merged with a neighboring one, forming the Madison-Grant united school district. A new high school was built for this district, and Fairmount High School became a middle school. When a new junior high school was opened in 1986, the Fairmount High School building was permanently closed.\nFairmount was hit hard by the recession of 1980\u20131982, which brought the permanent loss of factory jobs and the failure of many farms, but rebounded later in the decade. Fairmount is still relatively prosperous despite the ill fortunes of nearby industrial cities and a steady loss of population.\nIn September 1988, The James Dean Gallery opened in a former funeral home, Nodler's Funeral Home, on North Main Street. Over the years the Museum Exhibit has been toured by nearly 200,000 visitors who come from around the world to visit the hometown of James Dean. Also in 1988, English musician Morrissey filmed the music video for his single \"Suedehead\", a song inspired by his lifelong admiration of Dean, in the town.\nThe annual James Dean Festival takes place during the last full weekend in September and includes a Custom &amp; Hot Rod Car Show, The Grand Parade, Street Fair, Carnival Rides, Live Entertainment, a 1950s Dance Contest and the James Dean lookalike Contest.\nOn September 30 of each year there is a Memorial Service for James Dean at The Back Creek Friends Church, south of The Winslow Farm.\nThe Baldwin Addition Historic District, Fairmount Commercial Historic District, and J.W.

{"id": "11478", "revid": "1009367331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11478", "title": "Free verse", "text": "Free verse is an open form of poetry, which in its modern form arose through the French \"vers libre\" form. It does not use consistent meter patterns, rhyme, or any musical pattern. It thus tends to follow the rhythm of natural speech.\nDefinition.\nFree verse does not \"proceed by a strict set of rules \u2026 is not a literary type, and does not conform to a formal structure.\" It is not considered to be completely free. In 1948, Charles Allen wrote, \"The only freedom cadenced verse obtains is a limited freedom from the tight demands of the metered line.\" Free verse contains some elements of form, including the poetic line, which may vary freely; rhythm; strophes or strophic rhythms; stanzaic patterns and rhythmic units or cadences. It is said that verse is free \"when it is not primarily obtained by the metered line.\" Donald Hall goes as far as to say that \"the \"form\" of free verse is as binding and as liberating as the \"form\" of a rondeau,\" and T. S. Eliot wrote, \"No verse is free for the man who wants to do a good job.\"\nKenneth Allott, the poet and critic, said the adoption by some poets of \"vers libre\" arose from \"mere desire for novelty, the imitation of Whitman, the study of Jacobean dramatic blank verse, and the awareness of what French poets had already done to the alexandrine in France.\" The American critic John Livingston Lowes in 1916 observed \"Free verse may be written as very beautiful prose; prose may be written as very beautiful free verse. Which is which?\"\nSome poets have considered free verse restrictive in its own way. In 1922, Robert Bridges voiced his reservations in the essay \"Humdrum and Harum-Scarum\". Robert Frost, in a comment regarding Carl Sandburg, later remarked that writing free verse was like \"playing tennis without a net.\" Sandburg responded saying, in part, \u201cThere have been poets who could and did play more than one game of tennis with unseen rackets, volleying airy and fantastic balls over an insubstantial net, on a frail moonlight fabric of a court.\u201d William Carlos Williams said, \"Being an art form, a verse cannot be free in the sense of having no limitations or guiding principles.\" Yvor Winters, the poet and critic, said, \"\u2026the greatest fluidity of statement is possible where the greatest clarity of form prevails. \u2026 The free verse that is really verse\u2014the best that is, of W.C. Williams, H. D., Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, and Ezra Pound\u2014is, in its peculiar fashion, the antithesis of free.\"\nVers libre.\nVers libre is a free-verse poetic form of flexibility, complexity, and naturalness created in the late 19th century in France, in 1886. It was largely through the activities of \"La Vogue\", a weekly journal founded by Gustave Kahn, as well as the appearance of a band of poets unequaled at any one time in the history of French poetry. Their style of poetry was dubbed \u2018Counter-Romanticism\u2019 and it was led by Verlaine, Rimbaud, Mallarm\u00e9, Laforgue and Corbi\u00e8re. It was concerned with synaethesis (the harmony or equilibrium of sensation) and later described as \"the moment when French poetry began to take consciousness of itself as poetry.\" Gustave Kahn was commonly supposed to have invented the term vers libre and according to F. S. Flint, he \"was undoubtedly the first theorist of the technique(s).\" Later in 1912, Robert de Souza published his conclusion on the genre, voicing that \"A vers libre was possible which would keep all the essential characteristics of \"vers Classique\", but would free it from the encumbrances which usage had made appear indispensable.\" Thus the practice of verse libre was not the abandoning of pattern, but the creation of an original and complicated metrical form for each poem.\nThe formal stimuli for vers libre were \"vers lib\u00e9r\u00e9\" (French verse of the late 19th century that liberated itself from classical rules of versification whilst observing the principle of isosyllabism and regular patterned rhyme) and \"vers libre Classique\" (a minor French genre of the 17th and 18th century which conformed to classic concepts, but in which lines of different length were irregularly and unpredictably combined) and \"vers Populaire\" (versification derived from oral aspects of popular song). Remy de Gourmont's \"Livre des Masques\" gave definition to the whole vers libre movement; he notes that there should arise, at regular intervals, a full and complete line, which reassures the ear and guides the rhythm.\nForm and structure.\nThe unit of vers libre is not the foot, the number of the syllables, the quantity, or the line. The unit is the strophe, which may be the whole poem or only a part. Each strophe is a complete circle. Vers libre is \"verse-formal based upon cadence that allows the lines to flow as they will when read aloud by an intelligent reader.\"\nUnrhymed cadence in vers libre is built upon \"organic rhythm\" or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system. For vers libre addresses the ear, not the eye. Vers libre is liberated from traditional rules concerning meter, caesura, and line end stopping. Every syllable pronounced is of nearly equal value but is less strongly accented than in English; being less intense requires less discipline to mold the accents into the poem's rhythm. This new technique, as defined by Kahn, consists of the denial of a regular number of syllables as the basis for verification; the length of the line is long and short, oscillating with images used by the poet following the contours of his or her thoughts and is free rather than regular.\nAlthough free verse requires no meter, rhyme, or other traditional poetic techniques, a poet can still use them to create some sense of structure. A clear example of this can be found in Walt Whitman's poems, where he repeats certain phrases and uses commas to create both a rhythm and structure.\nPattern and discipline are to be found in good free verse: the internal pattern of sounds, the choice of exact words, and the effect of associations give free verse its beauty. With the Imagists free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form. Herbert Read, however, noted that \"the Imagist Ezra Pound gave free verse its musical structure to an extent that paradoxically it was no longer free.\"\nUnrestrained by traditional boundaries, the poet possesses more license to express and has more control over the development of the poem. This can allow for a more spontaneous and individualized poetic art product.\nTechnically, free verse has been described as spaced prose, a mosaic of verse and prose experience.\nLegacy.\nVers libre, until 1912, had hardly been heard of outside France until T. E. Hulme and F. S. Flint shared their knowledge in 1909 with the Poets Club in London. This later became the heart of the Imagist movement through Flint's advocacy of the genre. Thus, vers libre influenced Imagism in the discovery of new forms and rhythms.\nImagism, in the wake of French Symbolism (i.e. vers libre of French Symbolist poets) was the wellspring out of which the main current of Modernism in English flowed. T. S. Eliot later identified this as \"the point de repere usually taken as the starting point of modern poetry,\" as hundreds of poets were led to adopt vers libre as their medium.\nAntecedents.\nAs the French-language term \"vers libre\" suggests, this technique of using more irregular cadences is often said to have its origin in the practices of 19th-century French poets such as Gustave Kahn and Jules Laforgue, in his \"Derniers vers\" of 1890. Taupin, the US-based French poet and critic, concluded that free verse and \"vers libre\" are not synonymous, since \"the French language tends to give equal weight to each spoken syllable, whereas English syllables vary in quantity according to whether stressed or unstressed.\"\nThe sort of cadencing that we now recognize in free verse can be traced back at least as far as the Biblical Hebrew psalmist poetry of the Bible. By referring to the , it is possible to argue that free verse in English first appeared in the 1380s in the John Wycliffe translation of the Psalms and was repeated in different form in most biblical translations ever since.\nWalt Whitman, who based his long lines in his poetry collection \"Leaves of Grass\" on the phrasing of the King James Bible, influenced later American free verse composers, notably Allen Ginsberg. One form of free verse was employed by Christopher Smart in his long poem \"Jubilate Agno\" (Latin: \"Rejoice in the Lamb\"), written some time between 1759 and 1763 but not published until 1939.\nMany poets of the Victorian era experimented with free verse. Christina Rossetti, Coventry Patmore, and T. E. Brown all wrote examples of rhymed but unmetered verse, poems such as W. E. Henley's \"Discharged\" (from his \"In Hospital\" sequence).\nFree verse in English was persuasively advocated by critic T. E. Hulme in his \"A Lecture on Modern Poetry\" (1908). Later in the preface to \"Some Imagist Poets\" 1916, he comments, \"Only the name is new, you will find something much like \"vers libre\" in Dryden's \"Threnodia Augustalis\"; a great deal of Milton's \"Samson Agonistes\", and the oldest in Chaucer's \"House of Fame\".\"\nIn France, a few pieces in Arthur Rimbaud's prose poem collection \"Illuminations\" were arranged in manuscript in lines, rather than prose, and in the Netherlands, tachtiger (i.e., a member of the 1880s generation of innovative poets) Frederik van Eeden employed the form at least once in his poem \"Waterlelie\" (\"Water Lily\").\nGoethe in some early poems, such as \"Prometheus\" and also H\u00f6lderlin used free verse occasionally, due in part to a misinterpretation of the meter used in Pindar's poetry. H\u00f6lderlin also continued to write unmetered poems after discovering this error.\nThe German poet Heinrich Heine made an important contribution to the development of free verse with 22 poems, written in two-poem cycles, called \"Die Nordsee\" (\"The North Sea\") (written 1825\u20131826). These were first published in \"Buch der Lieder\" (\"Book of Songs\") in 182"}

W. de Klerk", "text": "Frederik Willem de Klerk (, ; born 18 March 1936) is a South African retired politician, who served as State President of South Africa from 1989 to 1994 and as Deputy President from 1994 to 1996. As South Africa's last head of state from the era of white-minority rule, he and his government dismantled the apartheid system and introduced universal suffrage. Ideologically a conservative and an economic liberal, he led the National Party from 1989 to 1997.\nBorn in Johannesburg, South Africa, to an influential Afrikaner family, de Klerk studied at Potchefstroom University before pursuing a career in law. Joining the National Party, to which he had family ties, he was elected to parliament and sat in the white-minority government of P. W. Botha, holding a succession of ministerial posts. As a minister, he supported and enforced apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged white South Africans. After Botha resigned in 1989, de Klerk replaced him, first as leader of the National Party and then as State President. Although observers expected him to continue Botha's defence of apartheid, de Klerk decided to end the policy. He was aware that growing ethnic animosity and violence was leading South Africa into a racial civil war. Amid this violence, the state security forces committed widespread human rights abuses and encouraged violence between Xhosa and Zulu, although de Klerk later denied sanctioning such actions. He permitted anti-apartheid marches to take place, legalised a range of previously banned anti-apartheid political parties, and freed imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, including Nelson Mandela. He also dismantled South Africa's nuclear weapons program.\nDe Klerk negotiated with Mandela to fully dismantle apartheid and establish a transition to universal suffrage. In 1993, he publicly apologised for apartheid's harmful effects, although not for apartheid itself. He oversaw the 1994 non-racial election in which Mandela led the African National Congress (ANC) to victory; de Klerk's National Party took second place with 20% of the vote. After the election, de Klerk became a Deputy President in Mandela's ANC-led coalition, the Government of National Unity. In this position, he supported the government's liberal economic policies. De Klerk had desired a total amnesty for political crimes committed under apartheid and opposed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate past human rights abuses by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. His working relationship with Mandela was strained, although he later spoke fondly of him. In May 1996, after the National Party objected to the new constitution, de Klerk withdrew it from the coalition government; the party disbanded the following year and reformed as the New National Party. In 1997, he retired from active politics and since then has lectured internationally.\nDe Klerk is a controversial figure. The recipient of a wide range of awards\u2014including the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014he was widely praised for dismantling apartheid and bringing universal suffrage to South Africa. Conversely, anti-apartheid activists criticised him for offering only a qualified apology for apartheid and for ignoring the human rights abuses carried out by his state security forces, while South Africa's white right-wing claimed that by abandoning apartheid he had betrayed the interests of the country's white minority.\nEarly life and education.\nChildhood: 1936\u20131954.\nF. W. de Klerk was born on 18 March 1936 in Mayfair, a suburb of Johannesburg. His parents were Johannes \"Jan\" de Klerk and Hendrina Cornelia Coetzer \u2013 \"her forefather was a Kutzer who stems from Austria\". He was his parents' second son, having a brother, Willem de Klerk, who was eight years his senior. De Klerk's first language is Afrikaans and the earliest of his distant ancestors to arrive in what is now South Africa did so in the late 1680s.\nDe Klerk's family had played a leading role in Afrikaner society; they had longstanding affiliations with South Africa's National Party. His paternal great-grandfather, Jan van Rooy, had been a senator, while his paternal grandfather, Willem, had been a clergyman who fought in the Anglo-Boer War and who stood twice, unsuccessfully, as a National Party candidate. His paternal aunt's husband was J. G. Strijdom, a former Prime Minister. His own father, Jan de Klerk, was also a Senator, having served as the secretary of the National Party in Transvaal, president of the senate for seven years, and a member of the country's cabinet for fifteen years under three Prime Ministers. In this environment, de Klerk was exposed to politics from childhood. He and family members would be encouraged to hold family debates; his more conservative opinions would be challenged by his brother Willem, who was sympathetic to the more liberal, \"enlightened\" faction of the National Party. Willem became a political analyst and later split from the National Party to found the liberal Democratic Party.\nThe name \"de Klerk\" is derived from Le Clerc, Le Clercq and De Clercq, and is of French Huguenot origin (meaning \"clergyman\" or \"literate\" in old French). De Klerk noted that he is also of Dutch descent, with an Indian ancestor from the late 1600s or early 1700s. He is also said to be descended from the Khoi interpreter known as Krotoa or Eva.\nDe Klerk's upbringing was secure and comfortable.\nWhen de Klerk was twelve years old, the apartheid system was officially institutionalised by the South African government; his father had been one of its originators. He therefore was, according to his brother, \"one of a generation that grew up with the concept of apartheid\". He was inculturated in the norms and values of Afrikaner society, including festivals like Kruger Day, loyalty to the Afrikaner nation, and stories of the \"age of injustice\" that the Afrikaner faced under the British. He was brought up in the Gereformeerde Kerk, the smallest and most socially conservative of South Africa's three Dutch Reformed Churches.\nThe de Klerk family moved around South Africa during his childhood, and he changed schools seven times over seven years. He eventually became a boarder at the Monument High School in Krugersdorp, where he graduated with a first-class pass in 1953. He was nevertheless disappointed not to get the four distinctions he was hoping for.\nUniversity and legal career.\nBetween 1954 and 1958, de Klerk studied at Potchefstroom University, graduating with both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Law. He later noted that during this legal training, he \"became accustomed to thinking in terms of legal principles\". While studying there, he became editor of the student newspaper, vice-chair of the student council, and a member of the Afrikaanse Studentebond's national executive council. At university, he was initiated into the Broederbond, a secret society for the Afrikaner social elite. As a student, he played both tennis and hockey and was known as \"something of a ladies' man\". At the university, he began a relationship with Marike Willemse, the daughter of a professor at the University of Pretoria. The couple married in 1959, when de Klerk was 23 and his wife 22.\nAfter university, de Klerk pursued a legal career, becoming an articled clerk with the firm Pelser in Klerksdorp. Relocating to Pretoria, he became an articled clerk for another law firm, Mac-Robert.\nIn 1962, he set up his own law partnership in Vereeniging, Transvaal, which he built into a successful business over ten years.\nDuring this period, he involved himself in a range of other activities. He was the national chair of the Junior Rapportryers for two years, and chair of the Law Society of Vaal Triangle. He was also on the council of the local technikon, on the council of his church, and on a local school board.\nEarly political career.\nIn 1972, his alma mater offered him a chair in its law faculty, which he accepted. Within a matter of days he was also approached by members of the National Party, who requested that he stand for the party at Vereeniging. De Klerk's candidature was successful and in November he was elected to the House of Assembly. There, he established a reputation as a formidable debater. He took on a number of roles in the party and government. He became the information officer of the Transvaal National Party, responsible for its propaganda output, and helped to establish a new National Party youth movement. He joined various party parliamentary study groups, including those on the Bantustans, labour, justice, and home affairs. As a member of various parliamentary groups, de Klerk went on several foreign visits, to Israel, Germany, the United Kingdom, and United States. It was in the latter in 1976 that he observed what he later described as the pervasive racism of U.S. society, later noting that he \"saw more racial incidents in one month there than in South Africa in a year\". In South Africa, de Klerk also played a senior role in two select committees, one formulating a policy on opening hotels to non-whites and the other formulating a new censorship law that was less strict than the one that had preceded it.\nIn 1975, Prime Minister John Vorster predicted that de Klerk would one day become leader of South Africa. Vorster planned to promote de Klerk to the position of a deputy minister in January 1976, but instead the job went to Andries Treurnicht. In April 1978, de Klerk was promoted to the position of Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions. In this role, he restored full autonomy to sporting control bodies which had for a time been under the jurisdiction of the government. As minister of Post and Telecommunications he finalised contracts that oversaw the electrification of that sector. As Minister of Mining he formalised a policy on coal exports and the structuring of Eskom and the Atomic Energy Corporation. He then became Minister of the Interior, he oversaw the repeal of the Mixed Marriages Act.\nIn 1981, de Klerk was awarded the Decoration for Meritorious Service for his work in the government. As education minister between 1984 and 1989 he upheld the apartheid system in South Africa's schools, and extended the department to cover all racial groups.\nFor most of his career, de Klerk had a very conservative reputation, and was seen as someone who would obstruct change in South Africa. He had been a forceful proponent of apartheid's system of racial segregation and was perceived as an advocate of the white minority's interests. While serving under P. W. Botha's government, de Klerk was never part of Botha's inner circle.\nState President.\nP. W. Botha resigned as leader of the National Party after an apparent stroke, and de Klerk defeated Botha's preferred successor, finance minister Barend du Plessis, in the race to succeed him. On 2 February 1989, he was elected leader of the National Party. He defeated main rival Barend du Plessis to the position by a majority of eight votes, 69\u201361. Soon after, he called for the introduction of a new South African constitution, hinting that it would need to provide greater concession to non-white racial groups. After becoming party leader, de Klerk extended his foreign contacts. He travelled to London, where he met with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Although she opposed the anti-apartheid movement's calls for economic sanctions against South Africa, at the meeting she urged de Klerk to release the imprisoned anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. He also expressed a desire to meet with representatives of the U.S. government in Washington D.C., although American Secretary of State James Baker informed him that the U.S. government considered it inopportune to have de Klerk meet with President George H. W. Bush.\nBecoming State President.\nBotha resigned on 14 August, and de Klerk was named acting state president until 20 September, when he was elected to a full five-year term as state president. After he became acting president, ANC leaders spoke out against him, believing that he would be no different from his predecessors; he was widely regarded as a staunch supporter of apartheid. The prominent anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu shared this assessment, stating: \"I don't think we've got to even begin to pretend that there is any reason for thinking that we are entering a new phase. It's just musical chairs\". Tutu and Allan Boesak had been planning a protest march in Cape Town, which the security chiefs wanted to prevent. De Klerk nevertheless turned down their proposal to ban it, agreeing to let the march proceed and stating that \"the door to a new South Africa is open, it is not necessary to batter it down\". The march took place and was attended by approximately 30,000 people. Further protest marches followed in Grahamstown, Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Durban. De Klerk later noted that his security forces could not have prevented the marchers from gathering: \"The choice, therefore, was between breaking up an illegal march with all of the attendant risks of violence and negative publicity, or of allowing the march to continue, subject to conditions that could help to avoid violence and ensure good public order.\" This decision marked a clear departure from the approach of the Botha era.\nAs President, he authorised the continuation of secret talks in Geneva between his National Intelligence Service and two exiled ANC leaders, Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma. In October, he personally agreed to meet with Tutu, Boesak, and Frank Chikane in a private meeting in Pretoria. That month, he also released a number of elderly anti-apartheid activists then imprisoned, including Walter Sisulu. He also ordered the closure of the National Security Management System. In December he visited Mandela in prison, speaking with him for three hours about the idea of transitioning away from white-minority rule. The collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that he no longer feared that Marxists would manipulate the ANC. As he later related, the collapse of \"the Marxist economic system in Eastern Europe... serves as a warning to those who insist on persisting with it in Africa. Those who seek to force this failure of a system on South Africa should engage in a total revision of their point of view. It should be clear to all that it is not the answer here either.\"\nOn 2 February 1990, in an address to the country's parliament, he introduced plans for sweeping reforms of the political system. A number of banned political parties, including the ANC and Communist Party of South Africa, would be legalised, although he emphasized that this did not constitute an endorsement of their socialist economic policies nor of violent actions carried out by their members, and the Separate Amenities Act of 1953, which governed the segregation of public facilities, would be lifted and all of those who were imprisoned solely for belonging to a banned organisation would be freed, including Nelson Mandela; the latter was released a week later. The vision set forth in de Klerk's address was for South Africa to become a Western-style liberal democracy; with a market-oriented economy which valued private enterprise and restricted the government's role in economics.\nDe Klerk later related that \"that speech was mainly aimed at breaking our stalemate in Africa and the West. Internationally we were teetering on the edge of the abyss.\" Throughout South Africa and across the world, there was astonishment at de Klerk's move. Foreign press coverage was largely positive and de Klerk received messages of support from other governments. Tutu said that \"It's incredible... Give him credit. Give him credit, I do.\" Some black radicals regarded it as a gimmick and that it would prove to be without substance. It was also received negatively by some on the white right-wing, including in the Conservative Party, who believed that de Klerk was betraying the white population. De Klerk believed that the sudden growth of the Conservatives and other white right-wing groups was a passing phase reflecting anxiety and insecurity. These white right-wing groups were aware that they would not get what they wanted through the forthcoming negotiations, and so increasingly tried to derail the negotiations using revolutionary violence. The white-dominated liberal Democratic Party, meanwhile, found itself in limbo, as de Klerk embraced much of the platform it had espoused, leaving it without a clear purpose.\nFurther reforms followed; membership of the National Party was opened up to non-whites. In June, parliament approved new legislation that repealed the Natives Land Act, 1913 and Native Trust and Land Act, 1936. The Population Registration Act, which established the racial classificatory guidelines for South Africa, was rescinded.\nIn legislative terms, he enabled the gradual end of apartheid. De Klerk also opened the way for the negotiations of the government with the anti-apartheid-opposition about a new constitution for the country. Nevertheless, he was accused by Anthony Sampson of complicity in the violence among the ANC, the Inkatha Freedom Party and elements of the security forces. In \"\", Sampson accuses de Klerk of permitting his ministers to build their own criminal empires.\nNegotiations toward universal suffrage.\nHis presidency was dominated by the negotiation process, mainly between his NP government and the ANC, which led to the democratization of South Africa. Throughout the negotiations, de Klerk primarily sought to prevent majority rule to preserve power for the white South African minority. His efforts, however, were thwarted when the Boipatong massacre caused a resurgence of international pressure against South Africa, leading to a weaker position at the negotiation tables for the National Party. In 1992, de Klerk held a whites-only referendum on ending apartheid, with the result being an overwhelming \"yes\" vote to continue negotiations to end apartheid. Nelson Mandela was distrustful of the role played by de Klerk in the negotiations, particularly as he believed that de Klerk was knowledgeable about 'third force' attempts to foment violence in the country and destabilize the negotiations.\nIn 1990, de Klerk gave orders to end South Africa's nuclear weapons programme; the process of nuclear disarmament was essentially completed in 1991. The existence of the nuclear programme was not officially acknowledged before 1993.\nIn 1993, de Klerk and Mandela were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in ending apartheid. The awarding of the prize to de Klerk was controversial, especially in the light of de Klerk's reported admission that he ordered a massacre of supposed Azanian People's Liberation Army fighters, including teenagers, shortly before going to Oslo in 1993. It appears that this massacre may form part of the basis for criminal charges that the Anti-Racism Action Forum laid against de Klerk in early 2016. Further, de Klerk's role in the destabilization of the country during the negotiation process through the operation of a 'third force' came to the attention of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and was never ultimately clarified.\nIn 1993, de Klerk issued an apology for the actions of the apartheid government, stating that: \"It was not our intention to deprive people of their rights and to cause misery, but eventually apartheid led to just that. Insofar as to what occurred we deeply regret it... Yes we are sorry\". Tutu urged for people to accept the apology, stating that \"saying sorry is not an easy thing to do... We should be magnanimous and accept it as a magnanimous act\", although Tutu was privately frustrated that de Klerk's apology had been qualified and had not gone so far as to call apartheid an intrinsically evil policy.\nAfter the first universal elections in 1994, de Klerk became deputy president in the government of national unity under Nelson Mandela; in 1996, de Klerk withdrew the National Party from Mandela's government, becoming leader of the official opposition. In 1997 he resigned the leadership of the National Party and retired from politics.\nVice Presidency.\nDe Klerk had been unhappy that changes had been made to the inauguration ceremony, rendering it multi-religious rather than reflecting the newly elected leader's particular denomination. When he was being sworn in, and the chief justice said \"So help me God\", de Klerk did not repeat this, instead stating, in Afrikaans: \"So help me the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\".\nMandela reappointed de Klerk's finance minister, Derek Keys, and retained Chris Stals, a former member of the Broederbond, as the head of the Central Bank. De Klerk supported the coalition's economic policies, stating that it \"accepted a broad framework of responsible economic policies\".\nDe Klerk's working relationship with Mandela was often strained, with the former finding it difficult adjusting to the fact that he was no longer president. De Klerk also felt that Mandela deliberately humiliated him, while Mandela found de Klerk to be needlessly provocative in cabinet. One dispute occurred in September 1995, after Mandela gave a Johannesburg speech criticising the National Party. Angered, de Klerk avoided Mandela until the latter requested they meet; when they ran into each other, they publicly argued in the street. Mandela later expressed regret for their disagreement but did not apologise for his original comments. De Klerk was also having problems from within his own party, some of whose members claimed that he was neglecting the party while in the government.\nMany in the National Party\u2014including many members of its executive committee\u2014were unhappy with the other parties' agreed upon new constitution in May 1996. The party had wanted the constitution to guarantee that it would be represented in the government until 2004, although it did not do so. On 9 May, de Klerk withdrew the National Party from the coalition government. The decision shocked several of his six fellow Afrikaner cabinet colleagues; Pik Botha, for example, was left without a job as a result. Roelf Meyer felt betrayed by de Klerk's act, while Leon Wessels thought that de Klerk had not tried hard enough to make the coalition work. De Klerk declared that he would lead the National Party in vigorous opposition to Mandela's government to ensure \"a proper multi-party democracy, without which there may be a danger of South Africa lapsing into the African pattern of one-party states\".\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission.\nIn de Klerk's view, his greatest defeat in the negotiations with Mandela had been his inability to secure a blanket amnesty for all those working for the government or state during the apartheid period. De Klerk was unhappy with the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). He had hoped that the TRC would be made up of an equal number of individuals from both the old and new governments, as there had been in the Chilean human rights commission. Instead, the TRC was designed to broadly reflect the wider diversity of South African society, and contained only two members who had explicitly supported apartheid, one a member of a right-wing group that had opposed de Klerk's National Party. De Klerk did not object to Tutu being selected as the TRC's chair for he regarded him as politically independent of Mandela's government, but he was upset that the white Progressive Party MP Alex Boraine had been selected as its deputy chair, later saying of Boraine: \"beneath an urbane and deceptively affable exterior beat the heart of a zealot and an inquisitor.\"\nDe Klerk appeared before the TRC hearing to testify for Vlakplaas commanders who were accused of having committed human rights abuses during the apartheid era. He acknowledged that security forces had resorted to \"unconventional strategies\" in dealing with anti-apartheid revolutionaries, but that \"within my knowledge and experience, they never included the authorisation of assassination, murder, torture, rape, assault or the like\". After further evidence of said abuses was produced by the commission, de Klerk stated that he found the revelations to be \"as shocking and as abhorrent as anybody else\" but insisted that he and other senior party members were not willing to accept responsibility for the \"criminal actions of a handful of operatives\", stating that their behaviour was \"not authorised [and] not intended\" by his government. Given the widespread and systemic nature of the abuses that had taken place, as well as statements by security officers that their actions had been sanctioned by higher ranking figures, Tutu questioned how de Klerk and other government figures could not have been aware of them. Tutu had hoped that de Klerk or another senior white political figure from the apartheid era would openly accept responsibility for the human rights abuses, thereby allowing South Africa to move on; this was something that de Klerk would not do.\nThe TRC found de Klerk guilty of being an accessory to gross violations of human rights on the basis that as State President he had been told that P. W. Botha had authorised the bombing of Khotso House but had not revealed this information to the Committee. De Klerk challenged the TRC on this point, and it backed down. When the final TRC report was released 2002, it made a more limited accusation: that de Klerk had failed to give full disclosure about events that took place during his presidency and that in view of his knowledge about the Khotso House bombing, his statement that none of his colleagues had authorised gross human rights abuses was \"indefensible\". In his later autobiography, de Klerk acknowledged that the TRC did significant damage to his public image.\nLater life.\nIn 1997, de Klerk was offered the Harper Fellowship at Yale Law School. He declined, citing protests at the university. De Klerk did, however, speak at Central Connecticut State University the day before his fellowship would have begun.\nIn 1999, de Klerk and his wife of 38 years, Marike de Klerk, were divorced following the discovery of his affair with Elita Georgiades, then the wife of Tony Georgiades, a Greek shipping tycoon who had allegedly given de Klerk and the NP financial support. Soon after his divorce, de Klerk and Georgiades were married. His divorce and remarriage scandalised conservative South African opinion, especially among the Calvinist Afrikaners. In 2000, his autobiography, \"The Last Trek \u2013 A New Beginning\", was published. In 2002, following the murder of his former wife, the manuscript of her own autobiography, \"A Place Where the Sun Shines Again\", was submitted to de Klerk, who urged the publishers to suppress a chapter dealing with his infidelity.\nIn 2000, de Klerk established the pro-peace FW de Klerk Foundation of which he is the chairman. De Klerk is also chairman of the Global Leadership Foundation, headquartered in London, which he set up in 2004, an organisation which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organisation composed of former heads of government and senior governmental and international organisation officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them.\nOn 3 December 2001, Marike de Klerk was found stabbed and strangled to death in her Cape Town flat. De Klerk, who was on a brief visit to Stockholm, Sweden, to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the Nobel Prize foundation, immediately returned to mourn his dead ex-wife. The atrocity was reportedly condemned strongly by South African president Thabo Mbeki and Winnie Mandela, among others, who openly spoke in favour of Marike de Klerk. On 6 December 21-year-old security guard Luyanda Mboniswa was arrested for the murder. On 15 May 2003, he received two life sentences for murder, as well as three years for breaking into Marike de Klerk's apartment.\nIn 2004, de Klerk quit the New National Party and sought a new political home after the NNP merged with the ruling ANC. That same year, while giving an interview to US journalist Richard Stengel, de Klerk was asked whether South Africa had turned out the way he envisioned it back in 1990. His response was:\nThere are a number of imperfections in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-\u00e0-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives \u2013 the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth \u2013 are in place.\nIn 2008, he repeated in a speech that \"despite all the negatives facing South Africa, he is very positive about the country\".\nIn 2006, he underwent surgery for a malignant tumour in his colon. His condition deteriorated sharply, and he underwent a tracheotomy after developing respiratory problems. He recovered and on 11 September 2006 gave a speech at Kent State University Stark Campus.\nIn January 2007, de Klerk was a speaker promoting peace and democracy in the world at the \"Towards a Global Forum on New Democracies\" event in Taipei, Taiwan, along with other dignitaries including Poland's Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa and Taiwan's then president Chen Shui-Bian.\nDe Klerk is an Honorary Patron of the University Philosophical Society of Trinity College, Dublin, and Honorary Chairman of the Prague Society for International Cooperation. He has also received the Gold Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Public Discourse from the College Historical Society of Trinity College, Dublin, for his contribution to ending apartheid.\nDe Klerk is also a Member of the Advisory Board of the Global Panel Foundation based in Berlin, Copenhagen, New York, Prague, Sydney and Toronto \u2013 founded by the Dutch entrepreneur Bas Spuybroek in 1988, with the support of Dutch billionaire Frans Lurvink and former Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek. The Global Panel Foundation is known for its behind-the-scenes work in public policy and the annual presentation of the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award with the Prague Society for International Cooperation.\nAfter the inauguration of Jacob Zuma as South Africa's president in May 2009, de Klerk said he is optimistic that Zuma and his government can \"confound the prophets of doom\".\nIn a BBC interview broadcast in April 2012, he said he lived in an all-white neighbourhood. He had five servants, three coloured and two black: \"We are one great big family together; we have the best of relationships.\" About Nelson Mandela, he said, \"When Mandela goes it will be a moment when all South Africans put away their political differences, will take hands, and will together honour maybe the biggest known South African that has ever lived.\"\nUpon hearing of the death of Mandela, de Klerk said: \"He was a great unifier and a very, very special man in this regard beyond everything else he did. This emphasis on reconciliation was his biggest legacy.\" He attended the memorial service for him on 10 December 2013.\nIn 2015, de Klerk wrote to \"The Times\" newspaper in the UK criticising moves to remove a statue to Cecil Rhodes at Oriel College, Oxford. He was subsequently criticized by some activists who described it as \"ironic\" that the last apartheid President should be defending a statue of a man labelled by critics as the \"architect of apartheid\". The Economic Freedom Fighters called for him to be stripped of his Nobel Peace Prize.\nOn 2 February 2020, de Klerk made a statement during an interview with SABC, a South African state broadcaster that \"the idea that apartheid was a crime against humanity was and remains an agitprop project initiated by the Soviets and their ANC/SACP allies to stigmatize white South Africans by associating them with genuine crimes against humanity.\" Considering the former South African President on the 30th anniversary of his speech, declaring the liberation of Nelson Mandela from prison, made such contended statements, many South Africans were outraged. According to an article written by \"Al Jazeera\"'s journalist Mia Swart, the son of Fort Calata, one of the \"Cradock Four,\" Lukhanyo Catala stated that the statements made by de Klerk \"reinforces our belief that de Klerk has never really seen us as human beings. He's never assigned any human value to our family.\" The article continues by stating many people around the world are calling for de Klerk's Nobel Peace Prize to be stripped from him. De Klerk's Foundation retracted his statement on 17 February; the Economic Freedom Fighters announced their letter of rejection to his apology later that day on Twitter.\nIdeology.\nDe Klerk was widely regarded as a politically conservative figure in South Africa. At the same time, he was flexible rather than dogmatic in his approach to political issues. \nHe often hedged his bets and sought to accommodate divergent perspectives, favouring compromise over confrontation.\nWithin the National Party, he continually strove for unity, coming to be regarded\u2014according to his brother\u2014as \"a party man, a veritable Mr National Party\". To stem defections from the right-wing end of the National Party, he made \"ultra-conservative noises\". This general approach led to the perception that he was \"trying to be all things to all men\".\nDe Klerk stated that within the party, he \"never formed part of a political school of thought, and I deliberately kept out of the cliques and foments of the enlightened and conservative factions in the party. If the policy I propounded was ultra-conservative, then that was the policy; it was not necessarily I who was ultra-conservative. I saw my role in the party as that of an interpreter of the party's real median policy at any stage.\"\nDe Klerk stated that \"The silver thread throughout my career was my advocacy of National Party policy in all its various formulations. I refrained from adjusting that policy or adapting it to my own liking or convictions. I analysed it as it was formulated, to the letter.\"\nFor much of his career, de Klerk believed in apartheid and its system of racial segregation.\nAccording to his brother, de Klerk underwent a \"political conversion\" that took him from supporting apartheid to facilitating its demolition. This change was not \"a dramatic event\" however, but \"was built... on pragmatism - it evolved as a process.\"\nHe did not believe that South Africa would become a \"non-racial society\", but rather sought to build a \"non-racist society\" in which ethnic divisions remained; in his view \"I do not believe in the existence of anything like a non-racial society in the literal sense of the word\", citing the example of the United States and United Kingdom where there was no legal racial segregation but that distinct racial groups continued to exist.\nDe Klerk accepted the principle of freedom of religion, although still believed that the state should promote Christianity.\nPersonality and personal life.\nGlad and Blanton stated that de Klerk's \"political choices were undergirded by self-confidence and commitment to the common good.\" His brother Willem stated that de Klerk's demeanour was marked by \"soberness, humility and calm\", that he was an honest, intelligent, and open minded individual, and that he had a \"natural cordiality\" and a \"solid sense of courtesy and good manners\". He felt that de Klerk's \"charisma\" came not from an \"exceptionally strong individualism\" but from \"his rationality, logic and balance\". He was, according to de Klerk, \"a man of compromise rather than a political innovator or entrepreneur\".\nWillem stated that \"he keeps an ear to the ground and is sensitive to the slightest tremors\", and that it was this which made him \"a superb politician\". Willem also stated that his brother was \"a team-man who consults others, takes them into his confidence, honestly shares information with his colleagues, and has a knack of making people feel importance and at peace\".\nHis former wife Marike described de Klerk as being \"extremely sensitive to beautiful things\", exhibiting something akin to an artistic temperament.\nWillem also noted that \"in the most profound sense\", de Klerk was driven by his concern for Afrikanerdom and \"the survival of his own people in their fatherland\". De Klerk was deeply upset that many Afrikaners did not realise that his reforms to dismantle apartheid were carried out with the intention of preserving a future for the Afrikaner people in South Africa.\nWith Marike, de Klerk had three children: Susan, who became a teacher, Jan, who became a farmer in Western Transvaal, and Willem, who went into public relations. Willem stated that de Klerk had a close relationship with his children, and that he was \"a loving man who hugs and cuddles\".\nDe Klerk was a heavy smoker but gave up smoking towards the end of 2005. He also enjoys a glass of whisky or wine while relaxing. He enjoys playing golf and hunting, as well as going for brisk walks.. On March 19, 2021 it was announced that he was diagnosed with mesothelioma.\nDe Klerk is a member of the World Minds community.\nReception and legacy.\nGlad and Blanton stated that de Klerk, along with Mandela, \"accomplished the rare feat of bringing about systemic revolution through peaceful means.\" His brother noted that de Klerk's role in South African history was \"to dismantle more than three centuries of white supremacy\", and that in doing so his was \"not a role of white surrender, but a role of white conversion to a new role\" in society.\nIn September 1990, Potchefstroom University awarded de Klerk with an honorary doctorate.\nSouth Africa's Conservative Party came to regard him as its most hated adversary."}

This variation is too small to have practical consequences in most applications. \nUsing the international definition of the inch as exactly 25.4 millimetres, one furlong is 201.168 metres. Five furlongs are about 1 kilometre ( is the exact value, according to the international conversion).\nHistory.\nThe name \"furlong\" derives from the Old English words ' (furrow) and ' (long). Dating back at least to early Anglo-Saxon times, it originally referred to the length of the furrow in one acre of a ploughed open field (a medieval communal field which was divided into strips). The furlong (meaning furrow length) was the distance a team of oxen could plough without resting. This was standardised to be exactly 40 rods or 10 chains. The system of long furrows arose because turning a team of oxen pulling a heavy plough was difficult. This offset the drainage advantages of short furrows and meant furrows were made as long as possible. An acre is an area that is one furlong long and one chain (66 feet or 22 yards) wide. For this reason, the furlong was once also called an acre's length, though in modern usage an area of one acre can be of any shape. The term furlong, or shot, was also used to describe a grouping of adjacent strips within an open field.\nAmong the early Anglo-Saxons, the rod was the fundamental unit of land measurement. A furlong was 40 rods; an acre 4 by 40 rods, or 4 rods by 1 furlong, and thus 160 square rods; there are 10 acres in a square furlong. At the time, the Saxons used the North German foot, which was about 10 percent longer than the foot of the international 1959 agreement. When England changed to a shorter foot in the late 13th century, rods and furlongs remained unchanged, since property boundaries were already defined in rods and furlongs. The only thing that changed was the number of feet and yards in a rod or a furlong, and the number of square feet and square yards in an acre. The definition of the rod went from 15 old feet to new feet, or from 5 old yards to new yards. The furlong went from 600 old feet to 660 new feet, or from 200 old yards to 220 new yards. The acre went from 36,000 old square feet to 43,560 new square feet, or from 4,000 old square yards to 4,840 new square yards. \nThe furlong was historically viewed as being equivalent to the Roman stade (\"stadium\"), which in turn derived from the Greek system. For example, the King James Bible uses the term \"furlong\" in place of the Greek \"stadion\", although more recent translations often use miles or kilometres in the main text and give the original numbers in footnotes.\nIn the Roman system, there were 625 feet to the \"stadium\", eight \"stadia\" to the mile, and three miles to the league. A league was considered to be the distance a man could walk in one hour, and the mile (from \"mille\", \"meaning thousand\") consisted of 1,000 \"passus\" (paces, five feet, or double-step).\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, medieval Europe continued with the Roman system, which the people proceeded to diversify, leading to serious complications in trade, taxation, etc. Around the year 1300, by royal decree England standardized a long list of measures. Among the important units of distance and length at the time were the foot, yard, rod (or pole), furlong, and the mile. The rod was defined as yards or feet, and the mile was eight furlongs, so the definition of the furlong became 40 rods and that of the mile became 5,280 feet (eight furlongs/mile times 40 rods/furlong times feet/rod).\nA description from 1675 states, \"Dimensurator or Measuring Instrument whereof the mosts usual has been the Chain, and the common length for English Measures four Poles, as answering indifferently to the Englishs Mile and Acre, 10 such Chains in length making a Furlong, and 10 single square Chains an Acre, so that a square Mile contains 640 square Acres.\" \u2014John Ogilby, Britannia, 1675\nThe official use of the furlong was abolished in the United Kingdom under the Weights and Measures Act 1985, an act that also abolished the official use of many other traditional units of measurement.\nUse.\nIn Myanmar, furlongs are currently used in conjunction with miles to indicate distances on highway signs. Mileposts on the Yangon\u2013Mandalay Expressway use miles and furlongs.\nIn the rest of the world, the furlong has very limited use, with the notable exception of horse racing in most English-speaking countries, including Canada and the United States. The distances for horse racing in Australia were converted to metric in 1972, but in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, and the United States, races are still given in miles and furlongs. Also distances along the canals in English navigated by narrowboats are commonly expressed in miles and furlongs.\nThe city of Chicago's street numbering system allots a measure of 800 address units to each mile, in keeping with the city's system of eight blocks per mile. This means that every block in a typical Chicago neighborhood (in either north\u2013south or east\u2013west direction but rarely both) is approximately one furlong in length. Salt Lake City's blocks are also each a square furlong in the downtown area. The blocks become less regular in shape farther from the center, but the numbering system (800 units to each mile) remains the same everywhere in Salt Lake County. Blocks in central Logan, Utah, and in large sections of Phoenix, Arizona, are similarly a square furlong in extent (eight to a mile, which explains the series of freeway exits: 19th Ave, 27th, 35th, 43rd, 51st, 59th ...). City blocks in the Hoddle Grid of Melbourne are also one furlong in length.\nMuch of Ontario, Canada, was originally surveyed on a ten-furlong grid, with major roads being laid out along the grid lines. Now that distances are shown on road signs in kilometres, these major roads are almost exactly two kilometres apart. The exits on highways running through Toronto, for example, are generally at intervals of two kilometres.\nThe furlong is also a base unit of the Humorous FFF system of units.\nDefinition of length.\nThe exact length of the furlong varies slightly among English-speaking countries. In Canada and the United Kingdom, which define the furlong in terms of the international yard of exactly 0.9144 metres, a furlong is 201.168\u00a0m.\nAustralia does not formally define the furlong, but it does define the chain and link in terms of the international yard.\nIn the United States, which defines the furlong, chain, rod, and link in terms of the U.S. survey foot of exactly metre, a furlong is approximately 201.1684 m long. The United States does not formally define a \"survey yard\". The difference of approximately two parts per million between the U.S. value and the \"international\" value is insignificant for most practical measurements.\nIn October 2019, U.S. National Geodetic Survey and National Institute of Standards and Technology announced their joint intent to retire the U.S. survey foot, with effect from the end of 2022. The furlong in U.S. Customary units is thereafter defined based on the International 1959 foot, giving the length of the furlong as exact 201.168 meters in the United States as well."}

In music, the fundamental is the musical pitch of a note that is perceived as the lowest partial present. In terms of a superposition of sinusoids, the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency sinusoidal in the sum of harmonically related frequencies, or the frequency of the difference between adjacent frequencies. In some contexts, the fundamental is usually abbreviated as 0, indicating the lowest frequency counting from zero. In other contexts, it is more common to abbreviate it as 1, the first harmonic. (The second harmonic is then 2 = 2\u22c51, etc. In this context, the zeroth harmonic would be 0\u00a0Hz.)\nAccording to Benward's and Saker's \"Music: In Theory and Practice\":\nExplanation.\nAll sinusoidal and many non-sinusoidal waveforms repeat exactly over time \u2013 they are periodic. The period of a waveform is the smallest value of for which the following equation is true:\nWhere () is the value of the waveform at . This means that this equation and a definition of the waveform\u2019s values over any interval of length is all that is required to describe the waveform completely. Waveforms can be represented by Fourier series.\nEvery waveform may be described using any multiple of this period. There exists a smallest period over which the function may be described completely and this period is the fundamental period. The fundamental frequency is defined as its reciprocal:\nSince the period is measured in units of time, then the units for frequency are 1/time. When the time units are seconds, the frequency is in \u22121, also known as Hertz.\nFor a tube of length with one end closed and the other end open the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic is 4, as indicated by the first two animations. Hence,\nTherefore, using the relation\nwhere is the speed of the wave, the fundamental frequency can be found in terms of the speed of the wave and the length of the tube:\nIf the ends of the same tube are now both closed or both opened as in the last two animations, the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic becomes 2. By the same method as above, the fundamental frequency is found to be\nAt 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) the speed of sound in air is 343\u00a0m/s (1129\u00a0ft/s). This speed is temperature dependent and increases at a rate of 0.6\u00a0m/s for each degree Celsius increase in temperature (1.1\u00a0ft/s for every increase of 1\u00a0\u00b0F).\nThe velocity of a sound wave at different temperatures:\nIn music.\nIn music, the fundamental is the musical pitch of a note that is perceived as the lowest partial present. The fundamental may be created by vibration over the full length of a string or air column, or a higher harmonic chosen by the player. The fundamental is one of the harmonics. A harmonic is any member of the harmonic series, an ideal set of frequencies that are positive integer multiples of a common fundamental frequency. The reason a fundamental is also considered a harmonic is because it is 1 times itself.\nThe fundamental is the frequency at which the entire wave vibrates. Overtones are other sinusoidal components present at frequencies above the fundamental. All of the frequency components that make up the total waveform, including the fundamental and the overtones, are called partials. Together they form the harmonic series. Overtones which are perfect integer multiples of the fundamental are called harmonics. When an overtone is near to being harmonic, but not exact, it is sometimes called a harmonic partial, although they are often referred to simply as harmonics. Sometimes overtones are created that are not anywhere near a harmonic, and are just called partials or inharmonic overtones.\nThe fundamental frequency is considered the \"first harmonic\" and the \"first partial\". The numbering of the partials and harmonics is then usually the same; the second partial is the second harmonic, etc. But if there are inharmonic partials, the numbering no longer coincides. Overtones are numbered as they appear the fundamental. So strictly speaking, the \"first\" overtone is the \"second\" partial (and usually the \"second\" harmonic). As this can result in confusion, only harmonics are usually referred to by their numbers, and overtones and partials are described by their relationships to those harmonics.\nMechanical systems.\nConsider a spring, fixed at one end and having a mass attached to the other; this would be a single degree of freedom (SDoF) oscillator. Once set into motion, it will oscillate at its natural frequency. For a single degree of freedom oscillator, a system in which the motion can be described by a single coordinate, the natural frequency depends on two system properties: mass and stiffness; (providing the system is undamped). The natural frequency, or fundamental frequency, 0, can be found using the following equation:\nwhere:\nTo determine the natural frequency, the omega value is divided by 2. Or:\nwhere:\nWhile doing a modal analysis, the frequency of the 1st mode is the fundamental frequency."}

In the King James Version of the New Testament, \" (\"mythos\"\") was rendered by the translators as \"fable\" in the First Epistle to Timothy, the Second Epistle to Timothy, the Epistle to Titus and the First Epistle of Peter.\nA person who writes fables is a fabulist.\nHistory.\nThe fable is one of the most enduring forms of folk literature, spread abroad, modern researchers agree, less by literary anthologies than by oral transmission. Fables can be found in the literature of almost every country.\nAesopic or Aesop's fable.\nThe varying corpus denoted \"Aesopica\" or \"Aesop's Fables\" includes most of the best-known western fables, which are attributed to the legendary Aesop, supposed to have been a slave in ancient Greece around 550 BCE. When Babrius set down fables from the \"Aesopica\" in verse for a Hellenistic Prince \"Alexander,\" he expressly stated at the head of Book II that this type of \"myth\" that Aesop had introduced to the \"sons of the Hellenes\" had been an invention of \"Syrians\" from the time of \"Ninos\" (personifying Nineveh to Greeks) and Belos (\"ruler\"). Epicharmus of Kos and Phormis are reported as having been among the first to invent comic fables. Many familiar fables of Aesop include \"The Crow and the Pitcher\", \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" and \"The Lion and the Mouse\". In ancient Greek and Roman education, the fable was the first of the \"progymnasmata\"\u2014training exercises in prose composition and public speaking\u2014wherein students would be asked to learn fables, expand upon them, invent their own, and finally use them as persuasive examples in longer forensic or deliberative speeches. The need of instructors to teach, and students to learn, a wide range of fables as material for their declamations resulted in their being gathered together in collections, like those of Aesop.\nAfrica.\nAfrican oral culture has a rich story-telling tradition. As they have for thousands of years, people of all ages in Africa continue to interact with nature, including plants, animals and earthly structures such as rivers, plains, and mountains. Grandparents enjoy enormous respect in African societies and fill the new role of story-telling during retirement years. Children and, to some extent, adults are mesmerized by good story-tellers when they become animated in their quest to tell a good fable.\nJoel Chandler Harris wrote African-American fables in the Southern context of slavery under the name of Uncle Remus. His stories of the animal characters Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear are modern examples of African-American story-telling, this though should not transcend critiques and controversies as to whether or not Uncle Remus was a racist or apologist for slavery. The Disney movie \"Song of the South\" introduced many of the stories to the public and others not familiar with the role that storytelling played in the life of cultures and groups without training in speaking, reading, writing, or the cultures to which they had been relocated to from world practices of capturing Africans and other indigenous populations to provide slave labor to colonized countries.\nIndia.\nIndia has a rich tradition of fabulous novels, mostly explainable by the fact that the culture derives traditions and learns qualities from natural elements. Some of the gods are forms of animals with ideal qualities. Also, hundreds of fables were composed in ancient India during the first millennium BCE, often as stories within frame stories. Indian fables have a mixed cast of humans and animals. The dialogues are often longer than in fables of Aesop and often witty as the animals try to outwit one another by trickery and deceit. In Indian fables, man is not superior to the animals. The tales are often comical. The Indian fable adhered to the universally known traditions of the fable. The best examples of the fable in India are the Panchatantra and the Jataka tales. These included Vishnu Sarma's \"Panchatantra\", the \"Hitopadesha\", \"Vikram and The Vampire\", and Syntipas' \"Seven Wise Masters\", which were collections of fables that were later influential throughout the Old World. Ben E. Perry (compiler of the \"Perry Index\" of Aesop's fables) has argued controversially that some of the Buddhist \"Jataka tales\" and some of the fables in the \"Panchatantra\" may have been influenced by similar Greek and Near Eastern ones. Earlier Indian epics such as Vyasa's \"Mahabharata\" and Valmiki's \"Ramayana\" also contained fables within the main story, often as side stories or back-story. The most famous folk stories from the Near East were the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", also known as the \"Arabian Nights\".\nIndian fables with morals.\nA case of spiritualist India, Indian Fables Stories Panchatantra are the most seasoned enduring accounts of humankind, getting by for a considerable length of time, from mouth to mouth, before they were recorded. You will cherish the clear pace of the tales, and they generally make for extraordinary sleep time or narrating meetings. Offer them will all story darlings, and let them appreciate the light, captivating existence of the narratives.\nThe Panchatantra is an antiquated Indian assortment of between related creature tales in Sanskrit section and composition. The soonest recorded work, ascribed to Vishnu Sharma, dates to around 300 BCE. The tales are likely a lot more established, having been passed down ages orally. The word \u201cPanchatantra\u201d is a blend of the words Pancha \u2013 which means five in Sanskrit, and Tantra \u2013 which means weave. Truly interpreted, it implies interlacing five skeins of customs and lessons into a book.\nThey are really archived forms of oral stories that stumbled into ages previously. Indeed, even today, they are supported stories across India and different pieces of the world. We are pleased to present to you an assortment of the most well known Panchatantra stories to you, for they are cherished by grown-ups and kids the same.\nThey give the children an early balance onto good and social qualities, forming the youthful personalities into a moral future. The vast majority of the accounts accompany recordings after the content, to give you an overall encounter. Appreciate them, with your children, and offer them with everybody, and help manufacture an increasingly wonderful world.\nThese Indian Panchatantra stories are converted into straightforward English, and consequently they fill in as extraordinary material for short Indian stories for youngsters. Antiquated tales, still pertinent for the present howdy tech way of life\nEurope.\nFables had a further long tradition through the Middle Ages, and became part of European high literature. During the 17th century, the French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine (1621\u20131695) saw the soul of the fable in the moral \u2014 a rule of behavior. Starting with the Aesopian pattern, La Fontaine set out to satirize the court, the church, the rising bourgeoisie, indeed the entire human scene of his time. La Fontaine's model was subsequently emulated by England's John Gay (1685\u20131732); Poland's Ignacy Krasicki (1735\u20131801); Italy's Lorenzo Pignotti (1739\u20131812) and Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi (1754\u20131827); Serbia's Dositej Obradovi\u0107 (1739\u20131811); Spain's F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda de Samaniego (1745\u20131801) and Tom\u00e1s de Iriarte y Oropesa (1750\u20131791); France's Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian (1755\u201394); and Russia's Ivan Krylov (1769\u20131844).\nModern era.\nIn modern times, while the fable has been trivialized in children's books, it has also been fully adapted to modern adult literature. Felix Salten's \"Bambi\" (1923) is a \"Bildungsroman\" \u2014 a story of a protagonist's coming-of-age \u2014 cast in the form of a fable. James Thurber used the ancient fable style in his books \"Fables for Our Time\" (1940) and \"Further Fables for Our Time\" (1956), and in his stories \"The Princess and the Tin Box\" in \"The Beast in Me and Other Animals\" (1948) and \"The Last Clock: A Fable for the Time, Such As It Is, of Man\" in \"Lanterns and Lances\" (1961). W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's \"The Revolt\" (1922), a metaphor for the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, described a revolt by animals that take over their farm in order to introduce \"equality.\" George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" (1945) similarly satirized Stalinist Communism in particular, and totalitarianism in general, in the guise of animal fable.\nIn the 21st century, the Neapolitan writer Sabatino Scia is the author of more than two hundred fables that he describes as \u201cwestern protest fables.\u201d The characters are not only animals, but also things, beings, and elements from nature. Scia's aim is the same as in the traditional fable, playing the role of revealer of human society. In Latin America, the brothers Juan and Victor Ataucuri Garcia have contributed to the resurgence of the fable. But they do so with a novel idea: use the fable as a means of dissemination of traditional literature of that place. In the book \"\"F\u00e1bulas Peruanas\" published in 2003, they have collected myths, legends, beliefs of Andean and Amazonian Peru, to write as fables. The result has been an extraordinary work rich in regional nuances. Here we discover the relationship between man and his origin, with nature, with its history, its customs and beliefs then become norms and values."}
{"id": "11492", "revid": "41419081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11492", "title": "Foot", "text": "The foot (plural: feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates. It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion. In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"foot\", in the sense of meaning the \"terminal part of the leg of a vertebrate animal\" comes from \"Old English fot \"foot,\" from Proto-Germanic *fot (source also of Old Frisian fot, Old Saxon fot, Old Norse fotr, Danish fod, Swedish fot, Dutch voet, Old High German fuoz, German Fu\u00df, Gothic fotus \"foot\"), from PIE root *ped- \"foot.\" \nThe \"plural form feet is an instance of i-mutation.\" \nStructure.\nThe human foot is a strong and complex mechanical structure containing 26 bones, 33 joints (20 of which are actively articulated), and more than a hundred muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The joints of the foot are the ankle and subtalar joint and the interphalangeal articulations of the foot. An anthropometric study of 1197 North American adult Caucasian males (mean age 35.5 years) found that a man's foot length was 26.3\u00a0cm with a standard deviation of 1.2\u00a0cm.\nThe foot can be subdivided into the hindfoot, the midfoot, and the forefoot:\nThe \"hindfoot\" is composed of the talus (or ankle bone) and the calcaneus (or heel bone). The two long bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula, are connected to the top of the talus to form the ankle. Connected to the talus at the subtalar joint, the calcaneus, the largest bone of the foot, is cushioned underneath by a layer of fat.\nThe five irregular bones of the \"midfoot\", the cuboid, navicular, and three cuneiform bones, form the arches of the foot which serves as a shock absorber. The midfoot is connected to the hind- and fore-foot by muscles and the plantar fascia.\nThe \"forefoot\" is composed of five toes and the corresponding five proximal long bones forming the metatarsus. Similar to the fingers of the hand, the bones of the toes are called phalanges and the big toe has two phalanges while the other four toes have three phalanges each. The joints between the phalanges are called interphalangeal and those between the metatarsus and phalanges are called metatarsophalangeal (MTP).\nBoth the midfoot and forefoot constitute the \"dorsum\" (the area facing upwards while standing) and the \"planum\" (the area facing downwards while standing).\nThe \"instep\" is the arched part of the top of the foot between the toes and the ankle.\nBones.\nThere can be many sesamoid bones near the metatarsophalangeal joints, although they are only regularly present in the distal portion of the first metatarsal bone.\nArches.\nThe human foot has two longitudinal arches and a transverse arch maintained by the interlocking shapes of the foot bones, strong ligaments, and pulling muscles during activity. The slight mobility of these arches when weight is applied to and removed from the foot makes walking and running more economical in terms of energy. As can be examined in a footprint, the medial longitudinal arch curves above the ground. This arch stretches from the heel bone over the \"keystone\" ankle bone to the three medial metatarsals. In contrast, the lateral longitudinal arch is very low. With the cuboid serving as its keystone, it redistributes part of the weight to the calcaneus and the distal end of the fifth metatarsal. The two longitudinal arches serve as pillars for the transverse arch which run obliquely across the tarsometatarsal joints. Excessive strain on the tendons and ligaments of the feet can result in fallen arches or flat feet.\nMuscles.\nThe muscles acting on the foot can be classified into extrinsic muscles, those originating on the anterior or posterior aspect of the lower leg, and intrinsic muscles, originating on the dorsal (top) or plantar (base) aspects of the foot.\nExtrinsic.\nAll muscles originating on the lower leg except the popliteus muscle are attached to the bones of the foot. The tibia and fibula and the interosseous membrane separate these muscles into anterior and posterior groups, in their turn subdivided into subgroups and layers.\n\"Anterior group\".\n\"Extensor group\": the tibialis anterior originates on the proximal half of the tibia and the interosseous membrane and is inserted near the tarsometatarsal joint of the first digit. In the non-weight-bearing leg, the tibialis anterior dorsiflexes the foot and lift its medial edge (supination). In the weight-bearing leg, it brings the leg towards the back of the foot, like in rapid walking. The extensor digitorum longus arises on the lateral tibial condyle and along the fibula, and is inserted on the second to fifth digits and proximally on the fifth metatarsal. The extensor digitorum longus acts similar to the tibialis anterior except that it also dorsiflexes the digits. Extensor hallucis longus originates medially on the fibula and is inserted on the first digit. It dorsiflexes the big toe and also acts on the ankle in the unstressed leg. In the weight-bearing, leg it acts similar to the tibialis anterior.\n\"Peroneal group\": the peroneus longus arises on the proximal aspect of the fibula and peroneus brevis below it. Together, their tendons pass behind the lateral malleolus. Distally, the peroneus longus crosses the plantar side of the foot to reach its insertion on the first tarsometatarsal joint, while the peroneus brevis reaches the proximal part of the fifth metatarsal. These two muscles are the strongest pronators and aid in plantar flexion. The peroneus longus also acts like a bowstring that braces the transverse arch of the foot.\n\"Posterior group\".\nThe \"superficial layer\" of posterior leg muscles is formed by the triceps surae and the plantaris. The triceps surae consists of the soleus and the two heads of the gastrocnemius. The heads of gastrocnemius arise on the femur, proximal to the condyles, and the soleus arises on the proximal dorsal parts of the tibia and fibula. The tendons of these muscles merge to be inserted onto the calcaneus as the Achilles tendon. The plantaris originates on the femur proximal to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius and its long tendon is embedded medially into the Achilles tendon. The triceps surae is the primary plantar flexor. Its strength becomes most obvious during ballet dancing. It is fully activated only with the knee extended, because the gastrocnemius is shortened during flexion of the knee. During walking it not only lifts the heel, but also flexes the knee, assisted by the plantaris.\nIn the \"deep layer\" of posterior muscles, the tibialis posterior arises proximally on the back of the interosseous membrane and adjoining bones, and divides into two parts in the sole of the foot to attach to the tarsus. In the non-weight-bearing leg, it produces plantar flexion and supination, and, in the weight-bearing leg, it proximates the heel to the calf. The flexor hallucis longus arises on the back of the fibula on the lateral side, and its relatively thick muscle belly extends distally down to the flexor retinaculum where it passes over to the medial side to stretch across the sole to the distal phalanx of the first digit. The popliteus is also part of this group, but, with its oblique course across the back of the knee, does not act on the foot.\nIntrinsic.\nOn the top of the foot, the tendons of extensor digitorum brevis and extensor hallucis brevis lie deep in the system of long extrinsic extensor tendons. They both arise on the calcaneus and extend into the dorsal aponeurosis of digits one to four, just beyond the penultimate joints. They act to dorsiflex the digits. Similar to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, there are three groups of muscles in the \"sole of foot\", those of the first and last digits, and a central group: \n\"Muscles of the big toe\": the abductor hallucis stretches medially along the border of the sole, from the calcaneus to the first digit. Below its tendon, the tendons of the long flexors pass through the tarsal canal. The abductor hallucis is an abductor and a weak flexor, and also helps maintain the arch of the foot. The flexor hallucis brevis arises on the medial cuneiform bone and related ligaments and tendons. An important plantar flexor, it is crucial to ballet dancing. Both these muscles are inserted with two heads proximally and distally to the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The adductor hallucis is part of this group, though it originally formed a separate system (see contrahens). It has two heads, the oblique head originating obliquely across the central part of the midfoot, and the transverse head originating near the metatarsophalangeal joints of digits five to three. Both heads are inserted into the lateral sesamoid bone of the first digit. The adductor hallucis acts as a tensor of the plantar arches and also adducts the big toe and might plantar flex the proximal phalanx.\n\"Muscles of the little toe\": Stretching laterally from the calcaneus to the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, the abductor digiti minimi form the lateral margin of the foot and are the largest of the muscles of the fifth digit. Arising from the base of the fifth metatarsal, the flexor digiti minimi is inserted together with abductor on the first phalanx. Often absent, the opponens digiti minimi originates near the cuboid bone and is inserted on the fifth metatarsal bone. These three muscles act to support the arch of the foot and to plantar flex the fifth digit.\n\"Central muscle group\": The four lumbricals arise on the medial side of the tendons of flexor digitorum longus and are inserted on the medial margins of the proximal phalanges. The quadratus plantae originates with two slips from the lateral and medial margins of the calcaneus and inserts into the lateral margin of the flexor digitorum tendon. It is also known as the flexor accessorius. The flexor digitorum brevis arises inferiorly on the calcaneus and its three tendons are inserted into the middle phalanges of digits two to four (sometimes also the fifth digit). These tendons divide before their insertions and the tendons of flexor digitorum longus pass through these divisions. Flexor digitorum brevis flexes the middle phalanges. It is occasionally absent. Between the toes, the dorsal and plantar interossei stretch from the metatarsals to the proximal phalanges of digits two to five. The plantar interossei adduct and the dorsal interossei abduct these digits, and are also plantar flexors at the metatarsophalangeal joints.\nClinical significance.\nDue to their position and function, feet are exposed to a variety of potential infections and injuries, including athlete's foot, bunions, ingrown toenails, Morton's neuroma, plantar fasciitis, plantar warts and stress fractures. In addition, there are several genetic disorders that can affect the shape and function of the feet, including a club foot or flat feet.\nThis leaves humans more vulnerable to medical problems that are caused by poor leg and foot alignments. Also, the wearing of shoes, sneakers and boots can impede proper alignment and movement within the ankle and foot. For example, High-heeled footwear are known to throw off the natural weight balance (this can also affect the lower back). For the sake of posture, flat soles with no heels are advised.\nA doctor who specializes in the treatment of the feet practices podiatry and is called a podiatrist. A pedorthist specializes in the use and modification of footwear to treat problems related to the lower limbs.\nFractures of the foot include:\nFoot sweat is the major cause of foot odor. Sweat itself is odorless, but it creates a beneficial environment for certain bacteria to grow and produce bad-smelling substances.\nPronation.\nIn anatomy, pronation is a rotational movement of the forearm (at the radioulnar joint) or foot (at the subtalar and talocalcaneonavicular joints). Pronation of the foot refers to how the body distributes weight as it cycles through the gait. During the gait cycle the foot can pronate in many different ways based on rearfoot and forefoot function. Types of pronation include neutral pronation, underpronation (supination), and overpronation.\nAn individual who neutrally pronates initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, the foot will roll in a medial direction, such that the weight is distributed evenly across the metatarsus. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track directly over the hallux.\nThis rolling inwards motion as the foot progresses from heel to toe is the way that the body naturally absorbs shock. Neutral pronation is the most ideal, efficient type of gait when using a heel strike gait; in a forefoot strike, the body absorbs shock instead via flexation of the foot.\nAs with a neutral pronator, an individual who overpronates initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, however, the foot will roll too far in a medial direction, such that the weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the hallux. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track inwards.\nAn overpronator does not absorb shock efficiently. Imagine someone jumping onto a diving board, but the board is so flimsy that when it is struck, it bends and allows the person to plunge straight down into the water instead of back into the air. Similarly, an overpronator's arches will collapse, or the ankles will roll inwards (or a combination of the two) as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves external rotation at the hip, knee, or ankle will be more likely to overpronate than one whose bone structure has internal rotation or central alignment. An individual who overpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the medial (inside) side of the shoe towards the toe area.\nWhen choosing a running or walking shoe, a person with overpronation can choose shoes that have good inside support\u2014usually by strong material at the inside sole and arch of the shoe. It is usually visible. The inside support area is marked by strong greyish material to support the weight when a person lands on the outside foot and then roll onto the inside foot.\nAn individual who underpronates also initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, the foot will not roll far enough in a medial direction. The weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the fifth metatarsal, towards the lateral side of the foot. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track laterally of the hallux.\nLike an overpronator, an underpronator does not absorb shock efficiently\u00a0\u2013 but for the opposite reason. The underpronated foot is like a diving board that, instead of failing to spring someone in the air because it is too flimsy, fails to do so because it is too rigid. There is virtually no give. An underpronator's arches or ankles don't experience much motion as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves internal rotation at the hip, knee, or ankle will be more likely to underpronate than one whose bone structure has external rotation or central alignment. Usually\u00a0\u2013 but not always\u00a0\u2013 those who are bow-legged tend to underpronate. An individual who underpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the lateral (outside) side of the shoe towards the rear of the shoe in the heel area.\nSociety and culture.\nHumans usually wear shoes or similar footwear for protection from hazards when walking outside. There are a number of contexts where it is considered inappropriate to wear shoes. Some people consider it rude to wear shoes into a house and a M\u0101ori Marae should only be entered with bare feet.\nFoot fetishism is the most common form of sexual fetish.\nOther animals.\nA paw is the soft foot of a mammal, generally a quadruped, that has claws or nails (e.g., a cat or dog's paw). A hard foot is called a hoof. Depending on style of locomotion, animals can be classified as plantigrade (sole walking), digitigrade (toe walking), or unguligrade (nail walking).\nThe metatarsals are the bones that make up the main part of the foot in humans, and part of the leg in large animals or paw in smaller animals. The number of metatarsals are directly related to the mode of locomotion with many larger animals having their digits reduced to two (elk, cow, sheep) or one (horse). The metatarsal bones of feet and paws are tightly grouped compared to, most notably, the human hand where the thumb metacarpal diverges from the rest of the metacarpus.\nMetaphorical and cultural usage.\nThe word \"foot\" is used to refer to a \"...linear measure was in Old English (the exact length has varied over time), this being considered the length of a man's foot; a unit of measure used widely and anciently. In this sense the plural is often foot. The current inch and foot are implied from measurements in 12c.\" \nThe word \"foot\" also has a musical meaning; a \"...metrical foot (late Old English, translating Latin pes, Greek pous in the same sense) is commonly taken to represent one rise and one fall of a foot: keeping time according to some, dancing according to others.\"\nThe word \"foot\" was used in Middle English to mean \"a person\" (c. 1200).\nThe expression \"...to put one's best foot foremost first recorded 1849 (Shakespeare has the better foot before, 1596)\". The expression to \"...put one's foot in (one's) mouth \"say something stupid\" was first used in 1942. The expression \"put (one's) foot in something\" meaning to \"make a mess of it\" was used in 1823.\nThe word \"footloose\" was first used in the 1690s, meaning \"free to move the feet, unshackled\"; the more \"figurative sense of \"free to act as one pleases\" was first used in 1873. Like \"footloose\", \"flat-footed\" at first had its obvious literal meaning (in 1600, it meant \"with flat feet\") but by 1912 it meant \"unprepared\" (U.S. baseball slang)."}

Many such shelters were constructed as civil defense measures during the Cold War.\nDuring a nuclear explosion, matter vaporized in the resulting fireball is exposed to neutrons from the explosion, absorbs them, and becomes radioactive. When this material condenses in the rain, it forms dust and light sandy materials that resemble ground pumice. The fallout emits alpha and beta particles, as well as gamma rays.\nMuch of this highly radioactive material falls to Earth, subjecting anything within the line of sight to radiation, becoming a significant hazard. A fallout shelter is designed to allow its occupants to minimize exposure to harmful fallout until radioactivity has decayed to a safer level.\nHistory.\nNorth America.\n During the Cold War, many countries built fallout shelters for high-ranking government officials and crucial military facilities, such as Project Greek Island and the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker in the United States and Canada's Emergency Government Headquarters. Plans were made, however, to use existing buildings with sturdy below-ground-level basements as makeshift fallout shelters. These buildings were placarded with the orange-yellow and black trefoil sign designed by United States Army Corps of Engineers director of administrative logistics support function Robert W. Blakeley in 1961.\nThe National Emergency Alarm Repeater (NEAR) program was developed in the United States in 1956 during the Cold War to supplement the existing siren warning systems and radio broadcasts in the event of a nuclear attack. The NEAR civilian alarm device was engineered and tested but the program was not viable and was terminated in 1967.\nIn the U.S. in September 1961, under the direction of Steuart L. Pittman, the federal government started the Community Fallout Shelter Program. A letter from President Kennedy advising the use of fallout shelters appeared in the September 1961 issue of \"Life\" magazine. Over the period 1961-1963, there was a growth in home fallout shelter sales, but eventually there was a public backlash against the fallout shelter as a consumer product.\nIn November 1961, in \"Fortune\" magazine, an article by Gilbert Burck appeared that outlined the plans of Nelson Rockefeller, Edward Teller, Herman Kahn, and Chet Holifield for an enormous network of concrete lined underground fallout shelters throughout the United States sufficient to shelter millions of people to serve as a refuge in case of nuclear war.\nThe United States ended federal funding for the shelters in the 1970s. In 2017, New York City began removing the yellow signs since members of the public are unlikely to find viable food and medicine inside those rooms.\nEurope.\nSimilar projects have been undertaken in Finland, which requires all buildings with area over 600\u00a0m\u00b2 to have an NBC (nuclear-biological-chemical) shelter, and Norway, which requires all buildings with an area over 1000\u00a0m\u00b2 to have a shelter.\nThe former Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries often designed their underground mass-transit and subway tunnels to serve as bomb and fallout shelters in the event of an attack.\nGermany has protected shelters for 3% of its population, Austria for 30%, Finland for 70%, Sweden for 81%, and Switzerland for 114%.\nSwitzerland.\nSwitzerland built an extensive network of fallout shelters, not only through extra hardening of government buildings such as schools, but also through a building regulation requiring nuclear shelters in residential buildings since the 1960s (the first legal basis in this sense dates from 4 October 1963). Later, the law ensured that all residential buildings built after 1978 contained a nuclear shelter able to withstand a blast from a 12 megaton explosion at a distance of 700 metres. The \"Federal Law on the Protection of the Population and Civil Protection\" still requires that every inhabitant should have a place in a shelter close to where they live.\nThe Swiss authorities maintained large communal shelters (such as the Sonnenberg Tunnel until 2006) stocked with over four months of food and fuel. The reference \"Nuclear War Survival Skills\" declared that, as of 1986, \"Switzerland has the best civil defense system, one that already includes blast shelters for over 85% of all its citizens.\" As of 2006, there were about 300,000 shelters built in private homes, institutions and hospitals, as well as 5,100 public shelters for a total of 8.6 million places, a level of coverage equal to 114% of the population.\nIn Switzerland, most residential shelters are no longer stocked with the food and water required for prolonged habitation and a large number have been converted by the owners to other uses (e.g., wine cellars, ski rooms, gyms). But the owner still has the obligation to ensure the maintenance of the shelter.\nDetails of shelter construction.\nShielding.\nA basic fallout shelter consists of shields that reduce gamma ray exposure by a factor of 1000. The required shielding can be accomplished with 10 times the thickness of any quantity of material capable of cutting gamma ray exposure in half. Shields that reduce gamma ray intensity by 50% (1/2) include of lead, of concrete, of packed earth or of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding multiplies. Thus, a practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of packed earth, reducing gamma rays by approximately 1024 times (210).\nUsually, an expedient purpose-built fallout shelter is a trench; with a strong roof buried by 1\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft) of earth. The two ends of the trench have ramps or entrances at right angles to the trench, so that gamma rays cannot enter (they can travel only in straight lines). To make the overburden waterproof (in case of rain), a plastic sheet may be buried a few inches below the surface and held down with rocks or bricks.\nBlast doors are designed to absorb the shock wave of a nuclear blast, bending and then returning to their original shape.\nClimate control.\nDry earth is a reasonably good thermal insulator, and over several weeks of habitation, a shelter will become dangerously hot. The simplest form of effective fan to cool a shelter is a wide, heavy frame with flaps that swing in the shelter's doorway and can be swung from hinges on the ceiling. The flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air. (This is a Kearny air pump, or KAP, named after the inventor, Cresson Kearny)\nUnfiltered air is safe, since the most dangerous fallout has the consistency of sand or finely ground pumice. Such large particles are not easily ingested into the soft tissues of the body, so extensive filters are not required. Any exposure to fine dust is far less hazardous than exposure to the fallout outside the shelter. Dust fine enough to pass the entrance will probably pass through the shelter. Some shelters, however, incorporate NBC-filters for additional protection.\nLocations.\nEffective public shelters can be the middle floors of some tall buildings or parking structures, or below ground level in most buildings with more than 10 floors. The thickness of the upper floors must form an effective shield, and the windows of the sheltered area must not view fallout-covered ground that is closer than 1.5\u00a0km (1\u00a0mi). One of Switzerland's solutions is to use road tunnels passing through the mountains, with some of these shelters being able to protect tens of thousands.\nFallout shelters are not always underground. Above ground buildings with walls and roofs dense enough to afford a meaningful protection factor can be used as a fallout shelter.\nContents.\nA battery-powered radio may be helpful to get reports of fallout patterns and clearance. However, radio and other electronic equipment may be disabled by electromagnetic pulse. For example, even at the height of the cold war, EMP protection had been completed for only 125 of the approximately 2,771 radio stations in the United States Emergency Broadcast System. Also, only 110 of 3,000 existing Emergency Operating Centers had been protected against EMP effects. The Emergency Broadcast System has since been supplanted in the United States by the Emergency Alert System.\nThe reference \"Nuclear War Survival Skills\" includes the following supplies in a list of \"Minimum Pre-Crisis Preparations\": one or more shovels, a pick, a bow-saw with an extra blade, a hammer, and polyethylene film (also any necessary nails, wire, etc.); a homemade shelter-ventilating pump (a KAP); large containers for water; a plastic bottle of sodium hypochlorite bleach; one or two KFMs (Kearny fallout meters) and the knowledge to operate them; at least a 2-week supply of compact, nonperishable food; an efficient portable stove; wooden matches in a waterproof container; essential containers and utensils for storing, transporting, and cooking food; a hose-vented can, with heavy plastic bags for liners, for use as a toilet; tampons; insect screen and fly bait; any special medications needed by family members; pure potassium iodide, a bottle, and a medicine dropper; a first-aid kit and a tube of antibiotic ointment; long-burning candles (with small wicks) sufficient for at least 14 nights; an oil lamp; a flashlight and extra batteries; and a transistor radio with extra batteries and a metal box to protect it from electromagnetic pulse.\nInhabitants should have water on hand, per person per day. Water stored in bulk containers requires less space than water stored in smaller bottles.\nKearny fallout meter.\nCommercially made Geiger counters are expensive and require frequent calibration. It is possible to construct an electrometer-type radiation meter called the Kearny fallout meter, which does not require batteries or professional calibration, from properly-scaled plans with just a coffee can or pail, gypsum board, monofilament fishing line, and aluminum foil. Plans are freely available in the public domain in the reference \"Nuclear War Survival Skills\" by Cresson Kearny.\nUse.\nInhabitants should plan to remain sheltered for at least two weeks (with an hour out at the end of the first week\u00a0\u2013 see Swiss Civil Defense guidelines), then work outside for gradually increasing amounts of time, to four hours a day at three weeks. The normal work is to sweep or wash fallout into shallow trenches to decontaminate the area. They should sleep in a shelter for several months. Evacuation at three weeks is recommended by official authorities.\nIf available, inhabitants may take potassium iodide at the rate of 130\u00a0mg/day per adult (65\u00a0mg/day per child) as an additional measure to protect the thyroid gland from the uptake of dangerous radioactive iodine, a component of most fallout and reactor waste.\nDifferent types of radiation emitted by fallout.\nAlpha (\u03b1).\nIn the vast majority of accidents, and in all atomic bomb blasts, the threat due to beta and gamma emitters is greater than that posed by the alpha emitters in the fallout. Alpha particles are identical to a helium-4 nucleus (two protons and two neutrons), and travel at speeds in excess of 5% of the speed of light. Alpha particles have little penetrating power; most cannot penetrate through human skin. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent injury from alpha radiation.\nBeta (\u03b2).\nBeta radiation consists of particles (high-speed electrons) given off by some fallout. Most beta particles cannot penetrate more than about of air or about of water, wood, or human body tissue; or a sheet of aluminum foil. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent most injuries from beta radiation.\nThe primary dangers associated with beta radiation are internal exposure from ingested fallout particles and beta burns from fallout particles no more than a few days old. Beta burns can result from contact with highly radioactive particles on bare skin; ordinary clothing separating fresh fallout particles from the skin can provide significant shielding.\nGamma (\u03b3).\nGamma radiation penetrates further through matter than alpha or beta radiation. Most of the design of a typical fallout shelter is intended to protect against gamma rays. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray. Thus, lead is only modestly better as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another shielding material such as aluminum, concrete, water or soil.\nSome gamma radiation from fallout will penetrate into even the best shelters. However, the radiation dose received while inside a shelter can be significantly reduced with proper shielding. Ten halving thicknesses of a given material can reduce gamma exposure to less than of unshielded exposure.\nWeapons versus nuclear accident fallout.\nThe bulk of the radioactivity in nuclear accident fallout is more long-lived than that in weapons fallout. A good table of the nuclides, such as that provided by the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute, includes the fission yields of the different nuclides. From this data it is possible to calculate the isotopic mixture in the fallout (due to fission products in bomb fallout).\nOther matters and simple improvements.\nWhile a person's home may not be a purpose-made shelter, it could be thought of as one if measures are taken to improve the degree of fallout protection.\nMeasures to lower the beta dose.\nThe main threat of beta radiation exposure comes from \"hot particles\" in contact with or close to the skin of a person. Also, swallowed or inhaled hot particles could cause beta burns. As it is important to avoid bringing hot particles into the shelter, one option is to remove one's outer clothing, or follow other decontamination procedures, on entry. Fallout particles will cease to be radioactive enough to cause beta burns within a few days following a nuclear explosion. The danger of gamma radiation will persist for far longer than the threat of beta burns in areas with heavy fallout exposure.\nMeasures to lower the gamma dose rate.\nThe gamma dose rate due to the contamination brought into the shelter on the clothing of a person is likely to be small (by wartime standards) compared to gamma radiation that penetrates through the walls of the shelter. The following measures can be taken to reduce the amount of gamma radiation entering the shelter:\nFallout shelters in popular culture.\nFallout shelters feature prominently in the Robert A. Heinlein novel \"Farnham's Freehold\" (Heinlein built a fairly extensive shelter near his home in Colorado Springs in 1963), \"Pulling Through\" by Dean Ing, \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" by Walter M. Miller and \"Earth\" by David Brin.\nThe 1961 \"Twilight Zone\" episode \"The Shelter\", from a Rod Serling script, deals with the consequences of actually using a shelter. Another episode of the series called \"One More Pallbearer\" featured a fallout shelter owned by millionaire. The 1985 adaption of the series had the episode \"Shelter Skelter\" that featured a fallout shelter.\nIn the \"Only Fools and Horses\" episode \"The Russians are Coming\" aired in 1981, Derek Trotter buys a lead fallout shelter, then decides to construct it in fear of an impending nuclear war caused by the Soviet Union.\nIn 1999 the film \"Blast from the Past\" was released. It is a romantic comedy film about a nuclear physicist, his wife, and son that enter a well-equipped, spacious fallout shelter during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. They do not emerge until 35 years later, in 1997. The film shows their reaction to contemporary society.\nThe \"Fallout\" series of computer games depicts the remains of human civilization after an immensely destructive global nuclear war; the United States of America had built underground vaults that were advertised to protect the population against a nuclear attack, but almost all of them were in fact meant to lure subjects for long-term human experimentation.\n\"Paranoia\", a role-playing game, takes place in a city-sized fallout shelter, which has become ruled by an insane computer.\nThe \"Metro 2033\" book series by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky depicts survivors' life in the subway systems below Moscow and Saint-Petersburg after a nuclear exchange between the Russian Federation and the United States of America.\nFallout shelters are often featured on the reality television show \"Doomsday Preppers\".\nThe Silo series of novellas by Hugh Howey feature extensive fallout-style shelters that protect the inhabitants from an initially unknown disaster.\nThe 2019 US film \"The Tomorrow Man\" centers around a reclusive man whose main preoccupation is tending to his in-home fallout shelter and the conspiracy theories that could put it to use.\nSee also.\nNation specific:\nGeneral:\nPublications:"}

The history of the modern Federated States of Micronesia is one of settlement by Micronesians; colonization by Spain, Germany, and Japan; United Nations trusteeship under United States-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; and gradual independence beginning with the ratification of a sovereign constitution in 1979.\nPre-colonial history.\nThe Austronesian ancestors of the Micronesians settled there over 4,000 years ago. A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on Pohnpei. People from the Caroline Islands had regular contact with the Chamorro people of the Marianas Islands, as well as rarer voyages into the eastern islands of the Philippines.\nPohnpei.\nOn Pohnpei, pre-colonial history is divided into three eras: \"Mwehin Kawa\" or \"Mwehin Aramas\" (Period of Building, or Period of Peopling, before c. 1100); \"Mwehin Sau Deleur\" (Period of the Lord of Deleur, c. 1100 to c. 1628); and \"Mwehin Nahnmwarki\" (Period of the Nahnmwarki, c. 1628 to c. 1885). Pohnpeian legend recounts that the Saudeleur rulers, the first to bring government to Pohnpei, were of foreign origin. The Saudeleur centralized form of absolute rule is characterized in Pohnpeian legend as becoming increasingly oppressive over several generations. Arbitrary and onerous demands, as well as a reputation for offending Pohnpeian deities, sowed resentment among Pohnpeians. The Saudeleur Dynasty ended with the invasion of Isokelekel, another semi-mythical foreigner, who replaced the Saudeleur rule with the more decentralized \"nahnmwarki\" system in existence today. Isokelekel is regarded as the creator of the modern Pohnpeian \"nahnmwarki\" social system and the father of the Pohnpeian people.\nNan Madol offshore of Temwen Island near Pohnpei, consists of a series of small artificial islands linked by a network of canals, and is often called the \"Venice of the Pacific\". It is located near the island of Pohnpei and was the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur Dynasty that united Pohnpei's estimated 25,000 people until its centralized system collapsed amid the invasion of Isokelekel. Isokelekel and his descendants initially occupied the stone city, but later abandoned it.\nEuropean colonization.\nEuropean explorers - first the Portuguese in search of the Spice Islands (Indonesia) and then the Spanish - reached the Carolines in the 16th century, with the Spanish establishing sovereignty.\nSpain sold the islands to Germany in 1899 under the terms of the German\u2013Spanish Treaty of that year.\nYap was a major German naval communications center before the First World War and an important international hub for cable telegraphy. It was occupied by Japanese troops in September, 1914, and passed to the Japanese Empire under the Versailles Treaty in 1919 as a mandated territory under League of Nations supervision. US commercial rights on the island were secured by a special US-Japanese treaty to that effect, concluded on February 11, 1922.\nEmpire of Japan.\nDuring World War I, many of the German possessions in the Pacific were conquered by Japan, who fought on the side of the Allies of World War I and was active in the Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I.\nThe Empire of Japan administrated the islands from 1920 under the South Seas Mandate granted by the League of Nations. During this period, the Japanese population grew to over 100,000 throughout Micronesia, while the indigenous population was about 40,000. Sugar cane, mining, fishing and tropical agriculture became the major industries.\nWorld War II.\nIn World War II, Japanese-held Yap was one of the islands bypassed in the U.S. \"Leapfrogging\" strategy, although it was regularly bombed by U.S. ships and aircraft, and Yap-based Japanese bombers did some damage in return. The Japanese garrison comprised 4,423 Imperial Japanese Army men under the command of Colonel Daihachi Itoh and 1,494 Imperial Japanese Navy men. A significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based in Truk Lagoon. In February 1944, Operation Hailstone, one of the most important naval battles of the war, took place at Truk, in which many Japanese support vessels and aircraft were destroyed.\nWorld War II brought an abrupt end to the relative prosperity experienced during Japanese civil administration.\nTrusteeship.\nThe United Nations created the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) in 1947. Pohnpei (then including Kusaie), Truk, Yap, Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands, together constituted the TTPI. The United States accepted the role of Trustee of this, the only United Nations Trusteeship to be designated as a \"Security Trusteeship\", whose ultimate disposition was to be determined by the UN Security Council. As Trustee the US was to \"promote the economic advancement and self-sufficiency of the inhabitants.\"\nIndependence.\nOn May 10, 1979, four of the Trust Territory districts ratified the Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia. The neighboring trust districts of Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands chose not to participate. The Honorable Tosiwo Nakayama, the former President of the Congress of Micronesia, became the first President of the FSM and formed his Cabinet. The FSM signed a Compact of Free Association with the U.S., which entered into force on November 3, 1986, marking Micronesia's emergence from trusteeship to independence. Under the Compact, the U.S. has full authority and responsibility for the defense of the FSM. This security relationship can be changed or terminated by mutual agreement. The Compact provides U.S. grant funds and federal program assistance to the FSM. Amended financial assistance provisions came on-line in FY 2004. The basic relationship of free association continues indefinitely.\nTrusteeship of the islands ended under United Nations Security Council Resolution 683, passed on December 22, 1990. The Compact was renewed in 2004."}

The President of the Federated States of Micronesia is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the president and his cabinet, while legislative power is vested in both the president and the Congress. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\nThe internal workings of the Micronesia are governed by the 1979 constitution, which guarantees fundamental human rights and establishes a separation of governmental powers. The Federation is in free association with the United States; the Compact of Free Association entered into force 3 November 1986.\nExecutive branch.\nThe president and the vice president are elected by Congress from among the four senators-at-large for four-year terms. The president is both the chief of state and head of government. Their congressional seats are then filled by special elections. The president and vice president are supported by an appointed cabinet.\nCabinet.\nThe President and Vice President are supported in the administration by a Cabinet made up of 9 appointed officials.

While its total land area is very small at , it has the 14th largest exclusive economic zone at .\nGeography.\nThe country consists of 607 islands extending across the Caroline Islands Archipelago. They are east of the Philippine Islands, and north of the island of New Guinea. The federal capital is Palikir, on Pohnpei island.\nThe 607 islands are grouped into four states, and from west to east are: \nSeparated from the main islands in southern Pohnpei State are the two islands of Nukuoro and Kapingamarangi. They are geographically part of the Micronesia region, but are linguistically and culturally part of the Polynesia region. The indigenous languages spoken on these two islands are in the Samoic family of Polynesian languages.\nLocation.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia are an island group in the Caroline Islands Archipelago of the western Pacific Ocean, in the Micronesia sub-region of Oceania.\nLocated about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to Indonesia at Geographic coordinates: \nMap references are Oceania and Micronesia.\nDimensions.\nArea:\nThe country's total area is four times the size of Washington, D.C. in the U.S.\nCoastline:\nThe combined coastlines of the country's 607 islands equal .\nMaritime claims:\nTerrain.\nThe country's 607 islands vary from high mountainous ones to low coral atolls.

{"id": "11498", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11498", "title": "Economy of the Federated States of Micronesia", "text": "The economic activity of the Federated States of Micronesia consists primarily of subsistence agriculture and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1.3 billion in the islands in 1986\u20132001. Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.\nUnder the terms of the Compact of Free Association, the United States provided FSM with around $2 billion in grants and services from 1986 to 2001. The Compact's financial terms are being renegotiated for an extension period. In 2001 the U.S. provided more than $84 million in Compact grants\u2014an amount equivalent to over one-third of FSM's GDP\u2014plus more than $20 million through other federal programs. Total official development assistance from all sources was more than $100 million in 2001, with nearly 90% of that total coming from the U.S.\nThe FSM public sector plays a central role in the economy as the administrator of the Compact money. The national and state-level governments employ over one-half of the country's workers and provide services accounting for more than 40%of GDP. Faced with the potential decrease or cessation of some of the assistance programs upon the Compact's financial provisions' expiry in 2001, the Government of the FSM in 1996 began to implement a program of economic reforms designed to reduce the role of the public sector in the economy. In addition, the advent of music startups using .fm domain names has provided a new stream of revenue to the government.\nIndustries.\nThe fishing industry is highly important. Foreign commercial fishing fleets pay over $20 million annually for the right to operate in FSM territorial waters. These licensing fees account for nearly 30% of domestic budgetary revenue. Additionally, exports of marine products, mainly reexports of fish to Japan, account for nearly 85% of export revenue.\nThe tourist industry is present but has been hampered by a lack of infrastructure. Visitor attractions include scuba diving in each state, World War II battle sites, and the ancient ruined city of Nan Madol on Pohnpei. Some 15,000 tourists visit the islands each year. The Asian Development Bank has identified tourism as one of FSM's highest potential growth industries.\nFarming is mainly subsistence, and its importance is declining. The principal crops are coconuts, bananas, betel nuts, cassava, and sweet potatoes. Less than 10% of the formal labor force and less than 7% of export revenue come from the agriculture sector. Manufacturing activity is modest, consisting mainly of a garment factory in Yap and production of buttons from trochus shells.\nTaxation and trade.\nThe large inflow of official assistance to FSM allows it to run a substantial trade deficit and to have a much lighter tax burden than other states in the region (11% of GDP in FSM compared to 18\u201325% elsewhere). The government also borrowed against future Compact disbursements in the early 1990s, yielding an external debt of $111 million in 1997 (over 50% of GDP).\nThere are no patent laws in Micronesia.\nStatistics.\nGDP:\npurchasing power parity - $277 million (2002 est.)\n&lt;br&gt;\"note:\"\nGDP is supplemented by grant aid, averaging perhaps $100 million annually\nGDP - real growth rate:\n1% (2002 est.)\nGDP - per capita:\npurchasing power parity - $3 900 (2002 est.)\nGDP - composition by sector:\n&lt;br&gt;\"agriculture:\"\n47%\n&lt;br&gt;\"industry:\"\n10%\n&lt;br&gt;\"services:\"\n43% (2010 est.)\nPopulation below poverty line:\n22.3%\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n&lt;br&gt;\"lowest 10%:\"\nNA%\n&lt;br&gt;\"highest 10%:\"\nNA%\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\n2% (2012 est.)\nLabor force:\n37,410 (2000)\nLabor force - by occupation:\ntwo-thirds are government employees\nUnemployment rate:\n15% (2010 estimate)\nBudget:\n&lt;br&gt;\"revenues:\"\n$157.5 million ($74 million less grants\n&lt;br&gt;\"expenditures:\"\n$134 million; including capital expenditures of $17.9 million (FY05 est.)\nIndustries:\ntourism, construction, fish processing, craft items from shell, wood, and pearls\nIndustrial production growth rate:\nNA%\nElectricity - production:\n261 million kWh (2010)\nElectricity - consumption:\n222 million kWh (2010)\nElectricity - exports:\n0 kWh (2010)\nElectricity - imports:\n0 kWh (2010)\nAgriculture - products:\nblack pepper, tropical fruits and vegetables, coconuts, cassava (tapioca), sweet potatoes; pigs, chickens\nExports:\n$123 million (f.o.b., 2000 est.)\nExports - commodities:\nfish, garments, bananas, black pepper\nExports - partners:\nJapan, United States, Guam, China (2010)\nImports:\n$82.5 million f.o.b.

{"id": "11504", "revid": "193093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11504", "title": "Fandom", "text": "A fandom is a subculture composed of fans characterized by a feeling of empathy and camaraderie with others who share a common interest. Fans typically are interested in even minor details of the objects of their fandom and spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, often as a part of a social network with particular practices, differentiating fandom-affiliated people from those with only a casual interest.\nA fandom can grow around any area of human interest or activity. The subject of fan interest can be narrowly defined, focused on something like an individual celebrity, or encompassing entire hobbies, genres or fashions. While it is now used to apply to groups of people fascinated with any subject, the term has its roots in those with an enthusiastic appreciation for sports. Merriam-Webster's dictionary traces the usage of the term back as far as 1903.\nMany fandoms overlap. There are a number of large conventions that cater to fandom such as film, comics, anime, television shows, cosplay, and the opportunity to buy and sell related merchandise. Annual conventions such as Comic Con International, Wondercon, Dragon Con and New York Comic Con are some of the more well known and highly attended events that cater to overlapping fandoms.\nOrganized subculture.\nFans of the literary detective Sherlock Holmes are widely considered to have comprised the first modern fandom, holding public demonstrations of mourning after Holmes was \"killed off\" in 1893, and creating some of the first fan fiction as early as about 1897 to 1902. Outside the scope of media, railway enthusiasts are another early fandom with its roots in the late 19th century that began to gain in popularity and increasingly organize in the first decades of the early 20th century.\nA wide variety of Western modern organized fannish subcultures originated with science fiction fandom, the community of fans of the science fiction and fantasy genres. Science fiction fandom dates back to the 1930s and maintains organized clubs and associations in many cities around the world. Fans have held the annual World Science Fiction Convention since 1939, along with many other events each year, and has created its own jargon, sometimes called \"fanspeak\". In addition, the Society for Creative Anachronism, a medievalist re-creation group, has its roots in science fiction fandom. It was founded by members thereof; and many science fiction and fantasy authors such as Marion Zimmer Bradley, Poul Anderson, Randall Garrett, David D. Friedman, and Robert Asprin have been members of the organization.\nMedia fandom split from science fiction fandom in the early 1970s with a focus on relationships between characters within TV and movie media franchises, such as \"Star Trek\" and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\". Fans of these franchises generated creative products like fan art and fan fiction at a time when typical science fiction fandom was focused on critical discussions. The MediaWest convention provided a video room and was instrumental in the emergence of fan vids, or analytic music videos based on a source, in the late 1970s. By the mid-1970s, it was possible to meet fans at science fiction conventions who did not read science fiction, but only viewed it on film or TV.\nAnime and manga fandom began in the 1970s in Japan. In America, the fandom also began as an offshoot of science fiction fandom, with fans bringing imported copies of Japanese manga to conventions. Before anime began to be licensed in the U.S., fans who wanted to get a hold of anime would leak copies of anime movies and subtitle them to exchange with friends in the community, thus marking the start of fansubs.\nWhile science fiction and anime grew fandom in media the Grateful Dead subculture that emerged in the late 1960s-early 1970s created a global fandom around hippie culture that would have lasting impacts on society and technology.\nFurry fandom refers to the fandom for fictional anthropomorphic animal characters with human personalities and characteristics. The concept of \"furry\" originated at a science fiction convention in 1980, when a drawing of a character from Steve Gallacci's \"Albedo Anthropomorphics\" initiated a discussion of anthropomorphic characters in science fiction novels, which in turn initiated a discussion group that met at science fiction and comics conventions.\nAdditional subjects with significant fandoms include comics, animated cartoons, sports, music, pulp magazines, soap operas, game shows, celebrities and video games.\nFan activities.\nMembers of a fandom associate with one another, often attending fan conventions and publishing and exchanging fanzines and newsletters. Amateur press associations are another form of fan publication and networking. Originally using print-based media, these sub-cultures have migrated much of their communications and interaction onto the Internet, which they also use for the purpose of archiving detailed information pertinent to their given fanbase. Often, fans congregate on forums and discussion boards to share their love for and criticism of a specific work. This congregation can lead to a high level of organization and community within the fandom, as well as infighting. Although there is some level of hierarchy among most of the discussion boards in which certain contributors are valued more highly than others, newcomers are most often welcomed into the fold. Most importantly, these sorts of discussion boards can have an effect on the media itself as was the case in the television show \"Glee\". Trends on the discussion boards have been known to influence the writers and producers of the show. The media fandom for the TV series \"Firefly\" was able to generate enough corporate interest to create a movie after the series was canceled.\nSome fans write fan fiction (\"fanfic\"), stories based on the universe and characters of their chosen fandom. This fiction can take the form of video-making as well as writing. Fan fiction may or may not tie in with the story's canon; sometimes the fans use the story's characters in different situations that do not relate to the plot line at all.\nEspecially at events, fans may also partake in \"cosplay\" (a portmanteau between \"cos\"tume and \"play\")the creation and wearing of costumes designed in the likeness of characters from a source workwhich can also be combined with role-playing, reenacting scenes or inventing likely behavior inspired by their chosen sources.\nOthers create fan vids, or analytical music videos focusing on the source fandom, and yet others create fan art. Such activities are sometimes known as \"fan labor\" or \"fanac\", an abbreviated form of the phrase \"fan activity\". The advent of the Internet has significantly facilitated fan association and activities. Activities that have been aided by the Internet includes the creation of fan \"shrines\" dedicated to favorite characters, computer screen wallpapers, avatars. Furthermore, the advent of the Internet has resulted in the creation of online fan networks who help facilitate the exchange of fanworks.\n[[File:Gamma-Bomb She-Hulk (9456803767).jpg|thumb|Cosplayer. She-Hulk, 2012]]Some fans create pictures known as \"[[Fan edits|edits]]\", which consist of pictures or photos with their chosen fandom characters in different scenarios. These edits are often shared on social media networks such as [[Instagram]], [[Tumblr]], or [[Pinterest]]. In some edits, one may see content relating to several different fandoms. Fans in communities online often make gifs or gif sets about their fandoms. [[GIF|Gifs]] or gif sets can be used to create non-canon scenarios mixing actual content or adding in related content. Gif sets can also capture minute expressions or moments. Fans use gifs to show how they feel about characters or events in their fandom; these are called reaction gifs.\n[[Jediism|The Temple of the Jedi Order]], a self-proclaimed \"real living, breathing religion\" views itself as separate from the Jedi as portrayed in the \"Star Wars\" franchise. Despite this, sociologists view religion's conflation to fandom as legitimate in some sense, classifying both as a participatory phenomenon.\nThere are also active fan organizations that participate in philanthropy and create a positive social impact. For example, the [[Harry Potter Alliance]] is a civic organization with a strong online component which runs campaigns around human rights issues, often in partnership with other advocacy and nonprofit groups; its membership skews college age and above. [[Nerdfighters]], another fandom formed around [[Vlogbrothers]], a YouTube vlog channel, are mainly high school students united by a common goal of \"decreasing world suck\".\nIn film.\nNotable feature-length [[documentary film|documentaries]] about fandom (some more respectful of the subjects than others) include \"[[Trekkies (film)|Trekkies]]\" and \"[[A Brony Tale]]\". \"Slash\" is a movie released in 2016 about a young boy who writes slash fanfiction.\nIn books.\n\"[[Fangirl (novel)|Fangirl]]\" is a novel written by [[Rainbow Rowell]] about a college student who is a fan of a book series called Simon Snow, which is written by a fictional author named Gemma T. Leslie. On October 6, 2015 Rainbow Rowell published a follow-up novel to \"Fangirl\". \"Carry On\" is stand-alone novel set in the fictional world that Cath, the main character of \"Fangirl\" writes fanfiction in.\nRelationship with the media industry.\n[[File:Anthro vixen colored.jpg|thumb|left|A cartoon of an \"anthro vixen\" furry]]\nThe film and television [[entertainment industry]] refers to the totality of fans devoted to a particular area of interest, whether organized or not, as the \"fanbase\".\nMedia fans, have, on occasion, organized on behalf of canceled [[television series]], with notable success in cases such as \"[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]\" in 1968, \"[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]\" in 1983, \"[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]\", in 1995, \"[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]\" in 2000 and 2001 (it was canceled with finality at the end of the 2002 season), \"[[Farscape]]\" in 2002, \"[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]\" in 2002, and \"[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]\" in 2007. (In the case of \"Firefly\" the result was the movie \"[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]\", not another season.) It was likewise the fans who facilitated the push to create a \"[[Veronica Mars]]\" film through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign. Fans of the show \"[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]\" launched a campaigned to save the show from being canceled using a Twitter hashtag and buying products from sponsors of the show. Fans of [[Arrested Development (TV series)|\"Arrested Development\"]] fought for the character [[List of Arrested Development characters|Steve Holt]] to be included in the fourth season. The Save Steve Holt! campaign included a Twitter and Facebook account, a hashtag, and a website.\nSuch outcries, even when unsuccessful, suggests a growing self-awareness on the part of entertainment consumers, who appear increasingly likely to attempt to assert their power as a bloc. [[Fan activism]] in support of the [[2007 Writers Guild of America strike]] through [[Fans4Writers]] appears to be an extension of this trend.\nIn [[science fiction]], a large number of the practitioners and other professionals in the field, not only writers but editors and publishers, traditionally have themselves come from and participate in [[science fiction fandom]], from [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Harlan Ellison]] to [[Patrick Nielsen Hayden]] and [[Toni Weisskopf]]. [[Ed Brubaker]] was a fan of the \"[[Captain America]]\" comics as a kid and was so upset that Bucky Barnes was killed off he worked on ways to bring him back. \"The Winter Soldier\" arc began in 2004 and in the 2005 sixth issue it was reviled that the Winter Soldier was Bucky Barnes. Many authors write fan fiction under pseudonyms. [[Lev Grossman]] has written stories in the \"Harry Potter, Adventure Time, and How to Train Your Dragon\" universes. [[S. E. Hinton|S.E. Hinton]] has written about both [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|\"Supernatural\"]] and her own books, \"[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]\". Movie actors often cosplay as other characters to enjoy being a regular fan at cons. [[Daniel Radcliffe]] cosplayed as [[Spider-Man]] at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con. Before the release of \"[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]\", [[Andrew Garfield]] dressed up as Spider-Man and gave an emotional speech about what Spider-Man meant to him and thanking fans for their support.\nThe relationship between fans and professionals has changed because of access to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. These give fans greater access to public figures such as creators, authors, and actors. Online platforms also give fans more ways to connect and participate in fandoms.\nSome fans have made the work they do in fandom into careers. The book \"[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]\" by E.L. James was originally a fan fiction of the \"[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]\" series published on [[FanFiction.Net]]. The story was taken down for mature content that violated the site's terms of service. James rewrote the story to take out any references to \"Twilight\" and self-published on The Writer's Coffee Shop in May 2011. The book was published by Random House in 2012 and was very popular selling over 100\u00a0million copies. Many fans were not happy about James using fan fiction to make money and felt it was not in the spirit of the community. There is contention over fans not being paid for their time or work. Gaming companies use fans to alpha and beta test their games in exchange for early access or promotional merchandise. The TV show \"[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]\" used fans to create promotional materials, though they did not compensate fans.\nThe entertainment industry has promoted its work directly to members of the fandom community by sponsoring and presenting at events and conventions dedicated to fandom. Studios frequently create elaborate exhibits, organize panels that feature celebrities and writers of film and television (to promote both existing work and works yet to be released), and engage fans directly by with Q&amp;A sessions, screening sneak previews, and supplying branded giveaway merchandise. The interest, reception and reaction of the fandom community to the works being promoted has a marked influence on how film studios and others proceed with the projects and products they exhibit and promote.\nFandom and Technology.\nThe rise of the Internet created new and powerful outlets for fandom. This began with early engineers trading [[Grateful Dead]] set lists and discussing the setup of the band's concert speaker system, called the \"Wall of Sound,\" on [[ARPANET]], a precursor to the Internet. This led to tape trading over [[FTP]], and the [[Internet Archive]] began to add [[Grateful Dead]] shows in 1995. Online tape trading communities such as etree evolved into [[Peer-to-peer|p2p]] networks trading shows through [[BitTorrent|torrents]]. After the birth of the [[World Wide Web]], many communities adopted the practices of Deadhead fandom online.\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Fandom| ]]\n[[Category:Hugo Gernsback]]"}

Fort Collins is the principal city of the Fort Collins, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and is a major city of the Front Range Urban Corridor. Situated on the Cache La Poudre River along the Colorado Front Range, Fort Collins is located north of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver. With a 2019 estimated population of 170,243, it is the fourth most populous city in Colorado after Denver, Colorado Springs, and Aurora. Fort Collins is a midsize college city, home to Colorado State University and Front Range Community College's Larimer campus.\nHistory.\nFort Collins was founded as a military outpost of the United States Army in 1864. It succeeded a previous encampment, known as Camp Collins, on the Cache La Poudre River, near what is known today as Laporte. Camp Collins was erected during the Indian wars of the mid-1860s to protect the Overland mail route that had been recently relocated through the region. Travelers crossing the county on the Overland Trail would camp there, but a flood destroyed the camp in June 1864. Afterward, the commander of the fort wrote to the commandant of Fort Laramie in southeast Wyoming, Colonel William O. Collins, suggesting that a site several miles farther down the river would make a good location for the fort. The post was manned originally by two companies of the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry and never had walls.\nSettlers began arriving in the vicinity of the fort nearly immediately. The fort was decommissioned in 1867. The original fort site is now adjacent to the present historic \"Old Town\" portion of the city. The first school and church opened in 1866, and the town was platted in 1867. The civilian population of Fort Collins, led by local businessman Joseph Mason, led an effort to relocate the county seat to Fort Collins from LaPorte, and they were successful in 1868.\nThe city's first population boom came in 1872, with the establishment of an agricultural colony. Hundreds of settlers arrived, developing lots just south of the original Old Town. Tension between new settlers and earlier inhabitants led to political divisions in the new town, which was incorporated in 1873. Although the Colorado Agricultural College was founded in 1870, the first classes were held in 1879.\nThe 1880s saw the construction of a number of elegant homes and commercial buildings and the growth of a distinctive identity for Fort Collins. Stone quarrying, sugar-beet farming, and the slaughter of sheep were among the area's earliest industries. Beet tops, an industry supported by the college and its associated agricultural experiment station, proved to be an excellent and abundant food for local sheep, and by the early 1900s the area was being referred to as the \"Lamb feeding capital of the world\". In 1901 the Great Western sugar processing plant was built in the neighboring city of Loveland.\nAlthough the city was affected by the Great Depression and simultaneous drought, it nevertheless experienced slow and steady growth throughout the early part of the twentieth century. During the decade following World War II, the population doubled and an era of economic prosperity occurred. Old buildings were razed to make way for new, modern structures. Along with revitalization came many changes, including the closing of the Great Western sugar factory in 1955, and a new city charter, adopting a council-manager form of government in 1954. Similarly, Colorado State University's enrollment doubled during the 1960s, making it the city's primary economic force by the end of the century.\nFort Collins gained a reputation as a very conservative city in the twentieth century, with a prohibition of alcoholic beverages, a contentious political issue in the town's early decades, being retained from the late 1890s until student activism helped bring it to an end in 1969. During that same period, civil rights activism and anti-war disturbances heightened tensions in the city, including the burning of several buildings on the CSU campus.\nDuring the late 20th century, Fort Collins expanded rapidly to the south, adding new development, including several regional malls. Management of city growth patterns became a political priority during the 1980s, as well as the revitalization of Fort Collins' Old Town with the creation of a Downtown Development Authority. In late July 1997, the city experienced after and during a 31-hour period when of rain fell. The rainfall was the heaviest on record for an urban area of Colorado. Five people were killed and $5 million in damages were dealt to the city. The waters flooded Colorado State University's library and brought about $140 million in damages to the institution.\nGeography.\nFort Collins is situated at the base of the Rocky Mountain foothills of the northern Front Range, approximately north of Denver, Colorado, and south of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Elevation is above sea level. Geographic landmarks include Horsetooth Reservoir and Horsetooth Mountain\u2014so named because of a tooth-shaped granite rock that dominates the city's western skyline.

{"id": "11508", "revid": "18872885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11508", "title": "Francis Drake", "text": "Sir Francis Drake (\u00a0\u2013 28 January 1596) was an English explorer, sea captain, slave trader, privateer, naval officer, and politician. Drake is best known for his circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition, from 1577 to 1580. This included his incursion into the Pacific Ocean, until then an area of exclusive Spanish interest, and his claim to New Albion for England, an area in what is now the American state of California. His expedition inaugurated an era of conflict with the Spanish on the western coast of the Americas, an area that had previously been largely unexplored by Western shipping.\nElizabeth I awarded Drake a knighthood in 1581 which he received on the \"Golden Hind\" in Deptford. In the same year he was appointed mayor of Plymouth. As a vice admiral, he was second-in-command of the English fleet in the victorious battle against the Spanish Armada in 1588. After unsuccessfully attacking San Juan, Puerto Rico, he died of dysentery in January 1596.\nDrake's exploits made him a hero to the English, but his privateering led the Spanish to brand him a pirate, known to them as \"El Draque\". King Philip II of Spain allegedly offered a reward of 20,000\u00a0ducats for his capture or death, about \u00a36\u00a0million (US$8\u00a0million) in modern currency.\nBirth and early years.\nFrancis Drake was born in Tavistock, Devon, England. Although his birth date is not formally recorded, it is known that he was born while the Six Articles were in force. His birth date is estimated from contemporary sources such as: \"Drake was two and twenty when he obtained the command of the \"Judith\"\" (1566). This would date his birth to 1544. A date of is suggested from two portraits: one a miniature painted by Nicholas Hilliard in 1581 when he was allegedly 42, so born circa 1539, while the other, painted in 1594 when he was said to be 52, would give a birth year of around 1541. Lady Elliott-Drake, the collateral descendant, and final holder of the Drake Baronetcy, argued in her book on 'The Family and Heirs of Sir Francis Drake' that Drake's birth year was 1541.\nHe was the oldest of the twelve sons of Edmund Drake (1518\u20131585), a Protestant farmer, and his wife Mary Mylwaye. The first son was alleged to have been named after his godfather Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.\nBecause of religious persecution during the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549, the Drake family fled from Devon to Kent. There Drake's father obtained an appointment to minister the men in the King's Navy. He was ordained deacon and was made vicar of Upnor Church on the Medway. Drake's father apprenticed him to his neighbour, the master of a barque used for coastal trade transporting merchandise to France. The ship's master was so satisfied with the young Drake's conduct that, being unmarried and childless at his death, he bequeathed the barque to Drake. \nMarriage and family.\nFrancis Drake married Mary Newman at St. Budeaux church, Plymouth, in July 1569. She died 12 years later, in 1581. In 1585, Drake married Elizabeth Sydenham\u2014born circa 1562, the only child of Sir George Sydenham, of Combe Sydenham, who was the High Sheriff of Somerset. After Drake's death, the widow Elizabeth eventually married Sir William Courtenay of Powderham.\nCareer at sea.\nIn the 1550s, Drake's father found the young man a position with the owner and master of a small barque. Drake likely engaged in commerce among England, the Low Countries and France. On the death of the barque's owner, Drake was given the barque.\nAt the age of eighteen he was purser of a ship which sailed to the Bay of Biscay.\nAt twenty (c. 1563\u20131564) he made a voyage to the coast of Guinea in a ship owned by William and John Hawkins, some of his relatives from Plymouth.\nIn 1566\u20131567, Drake made his first voyage to the Americas, sailing under Captain John Lovell on one of a fleet of ships owned by the Hawkins family. They attacked Portuguese towns and ships on the coast of West Africa and then sailed to the Americas and sold the captured cargoes of slaves to Spanish plantations. The voyage was largely unsuccessful and more than 90 slaves were released without payment.\nDrake's second voyage to the Americas and his second slaving voyage ended in the ill-fated 1568 incident at San Juan de Ul\u00faa. Whilst negotiating to resupply and repair at a Spanish port in Mexico, the fleet was attacked by Spanish warships, with all but two of the English ships lost. He escaped along with John Hawkins, surviving the attack by swimming. Drake's hostility towards the Spanish is said to have started with this incident and he vowed revenge.\nIn 1570, his reputation enabled him to proceed to the West Indies with two vessels under his command. He renewed his visit the next year for the sole purpose of obtaining information.\nDrake's first victory.\nIn 1572, Drake embarked on his first major independent enterprise. He planned an attack on the Isthmus of Panama, known to the Spanish as Tierra Firme and the English as the Spanish Main. This was the point at which the silver and gold treasure of Peru had to be landed and sent overland to the Caribbean Sea, where galleons from Spain would pick it up at the town of Nombre de Dios. Drake left Plymouth on 24 May 1572, with a crew of 73 men in two small vessels, the \"Pascha\" (70 tons) and the \"Swan\" (25 tons), to capture Nombre de Dios.\nDrake's first raid was late in July 1572. Drake formed an alliance with the Cimarrons. Drake and his men captured the town and its treasure. When his men noticed that Drake was bleeding profusely from a wound, they insisted on withdrawing to save his life and left the treasure. Drake stayed in the area for almost a year, raiding Spanish shipping and attempting to capture a treasure shipment.\nThe most celebrated of Drake's adventures along the Spanish Main was his capture of the Spanish Silver Train at Nombre de Dios in March 1573. He raided the waters around Darien (in modern Panama) with a crew including many French privateers including Guillaume Le Testu, a French buccaneer, and African slaves (Maroons) who had escaped the Spanish. One of these men was Diego, who under Drake became a free man was also a capable ship builder. Drake tracked the Silver Train to the nearby port of Nombre de Dios. After their attack on the richly laden mule train, Drake and his party found that they had captured around 20 tons of silver and gold. They buried much of the treasure, as it was too much for their party to carry, and made off with a fortune in gold. (An account of this may have given rise to subsequent stories of pirates and buried treasure). Wounded, Le Testu was captured and later beheaded. The small band of adventurers dragged as much gold and silver as they could carry back across some 18 miles of jungle-covered mountains to where they had left the raiding boats. When they got to the coast, the boats were gone. Drake and his men, downhearted, exhausted and hungry, had nowhere to go and the Spanish were not far behind.\nAt this point, Drake rallied his men, buried the treasure on the beach, and built a raft to sail with two volunteers ten miles along the surf-lashed coast to where they had left the flagship. When Drake finally reached its deck, his men were alarmed at his bedraggled appearance. Fearing the worst, they asked him how the raid had gone. Drake could not resist a joke and teased them by looking downhearted. Then he laughed, pulled a necklace of Spanish gold from around his neck and said \"Our voyage is made, lads!\" By 9 August 1573, he had returned to Plymouth.\nIt was during this expedition that Drake climbed a high tree in the central mountains of the Isthmus of Panama and thus became the first Englishman to see the Pacific Ocean. He remarked as he saw it that he hoped one day an Englishman would be able to sail it \u2013 which he would do years later as part of his circumnavigation of the world.\nWhen Drake returned to Plymouth after the raids, the government signed a temporary truce with King Philip II of Spain and so was unable to acknowledge Drake's accomplishment officially. Drake was considered a hero in England and a pirate in Spain for his raids.\nRathlin Island massacre.\nDrake was present at the 1575 Rathlin Island massacre in Ireland. Acting on the instructions of Sir Henry Sidney and the Earl of Essex, Sir John Norreys and Drake laid siege to Rathlin Castle. Despite their surrender, Norreys' troops killed all the 200 defenders and more than 400 civilian men, women and children of Clan MacDonnell. Meanwhile, Drake was given the task of preventing any Gaelic Irish or Scottish reinforcements reaching the island. Therefore, the remaining leader of the Gaelic defence against English power, Sorley Boy MacDonnell, was forced to stay on the mainland. Essex wrote in his letter to Queen Elizabeth's secretary, that following the attack Sorley Boy \"was likely to have run mad for sorrow, tearing and tormenting himself and saying that he there lost all that he ever had.\"\nCircumnavigation (1577\u20131580).\nWith the success of the Panama isthmus raid, in 1577 Elizabeth I of England sent Drake to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Drake used the plans that Sir Richard Grenville had received the patent for in 1574 from Elizabeth, which was rescinded a year later after protests from Philip of Spain. Diego was once again employed under Drake; his fluency in Spanish and English would make him a useful interpreter when Spaniards or Spanish-speaking Portuguese were captured. He was employed as Drake's servant and was paid wages, just like the rest of the crew. Drake and the fleet set out from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, but bad weather threatened him and his fleet. They were forced to take refuge in Falmouth, Cornwall, from where they returned to Plymouth for repair.\nAfter this major setback, Drake set sail again on 13 December aboard \"Pelican\" with four other ships and 164 men. He soon added a sixth ship, \"Mary\" (formerly \"Santa Maria\"), a Portuguese merchant ship that had been captured off the coast of Africa near the Cape Verde Islands. He also added its captain, Nuno da Silva, a man with considerable experience navigating in South American waters.\nDrake's fleet suffered great attrition; he scuttled both \"Christopher\" and the flyboat \"Swan\" due to loss of men on the Atlantic crossing. He made landfall at the gloomy bay of San Julian, in what is now Argentina. Ferdinand Magellan had called here half a century earlier, where he put to death some mutineers. Drake's men saw weathered and bleached skeletons on the grim Spanish gibbets. Following Magellan's example, Drake tried and executed his own \"mutineer\" Thomas Doughty. The crew discovered that \"Mary\" had rotting timbers, so they burned the ship. Drake decided to remain the winter in San Julian before attempting the Strait of Magellan.\nExecution of Thomas Doughty.\nOn his voyage to interfere with Spanish treasure fleets, Drake had several quarrels with his co-commander Thomas Doughty and on 3 June 1578, accused him of witchcraft and charged him with mutiny and treason in a shipboard trial. Drake claimed to have a (never presented) commission from the Queen to carry out such acts and denied Doughty a trial in England. The main pieces of evidence against Doughty were the testimony of the ship's carpenter, Edward Bright, who after the trial was promoted to master of the ship \"Marigold\", and Doughty's admission of telling Lord Burghley, a vocal opponent of agitating the Spanish, of the intent of the voyage. Drake consented to his request of Communion and dined with him, of which Francis Fletcher had this strange account:\nDrake had Thomas Doughty beheaded on 2 July 1578. When the ship's chaplain Francis Fletcher in a sermon suggested that the woes of the voyage in January 1580 were connected to the unjust demise of Doughty, Drake chained the clergyman to a hatch cover and pronounced him excommunicated.\nEntering the Pacific (1578).\nThe three remaining ships of his convoy departed for the Magellan Strait at the southern tip of South America. A few weeks later (September 1578) Drake made it to the Pacific, but violent storms destroyed one of the three ships, the \"Marigold\" (captained by John Thomas) in the strait and caused another, the \"Elizabeth\" captained by John Wynter, to return to England, leaving only the \"Pelican\". After this passage, the \"Pelican\" was pushed south and discovered an island that Drake called Elizabeth Island. Drake, like navigators before him, probably reached a latitude of 55\u00b0S (according to astronomical data quoted in Hakluyt's \"The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation\" of 1589) along the Chilean coast. In the Magellan Strait Francis and his men engaged in skirmish with local indigenous people, becoming the first Europeans to kill indigenous peoples in southern Patagonia. During the stay in the strait, crew members discovered that an infusion made of the bark of \"Drimys winteri\" could be used as remedy against scurvy. Captain Wynter ordered the collection of great amounts of bark \u2013 hence the scientific name.\nDespite popular lore, it seems unlikely that Drake reached Cape Horn or the eponymous Drake Passage, because his descriptions do not fit the first and his shipmates denied having seen an open sea. Historian Mateo Martinic, who examined his travels, credits Drake with the discovery of the \"southern end of the Americas and the oceanic space south of it\". The first report of his discovery of an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego was written after the 1618 publication of the voyage of Willem Schouten and Jacob le Maire around Cape Horn in 1616.\nDrake pushed onwards in his lone flagship, now renamed the \"Golden Hind\" in honour of Sir Christopher Hatton (after his coat of arms). The \"Golden Hind\" sailed north along the Pacific coast of South America, attacking Spanish ports and pillaging towns. Some Spanish ships were captured, and Drake used their more accurate charts. Before reaching the coast of Peru, Drake visited Mocha Island, where he was seriously injured by hostile Mapuche. Later he sacked the port of Valpara\u00edso further north in Chile, where he also captured a ship full of Chilean wine.\nCapture of Spanish treasure ships.\nNear Lima, Drake captured a Spanish ship with 25,000\u00a0pesos of Peruvian gold, amounting in value to 37,000\u00a0ducats of Spanish money (about \u00a37m by modern standards). Drake also discovered news of another ship, \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n\", which was sailing west towards Manila. It would come to be called the \"Cacafuego\". Drake gave chase and eventually captured the treasure ship, which proved his most profitable capture.\nAboard \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n\", Drake found of gold, a golden crucifix, jewels, 13\u00a0chests full of royals of plate and of silver. Drake was naturally pleased at his good luck in capturing the galleon, and he showed it by dining with the captured ship's officers and gentleman passengers. He offloaded his captives a short time later, and gave each one gifts appropriate to their rank, as well as a letter of safe conduct.\nCoast of California: Nova Albion (1579).\nPrior to Drake's voyage, the western coast of North America had only been partially explored in 1542 by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo who sailed for Spain. So, intending to avoid further conflict with Spain, Drake navigated northwest of Spanish presence and sought a discreet site at which the crew could prepare for the journey back to England.\nOn 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at what is now South Cove, Cape Arago, just south of Coos Bay, Oregon, and then sailed south while searching for a suitable harbour to repair his ailing ship. On 17 June, Drake and his crew found a protected cove when they landed on the Pacific coast of what is now Northern California. While ashore, he claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I as Nova Albion or New Albion. To document and assert his claim, Drake posted an engraved plate of brass to claim sovereignty for Elizabeth and every successive English monarch.\nAfter erecting a fort and tents ashore, the crew labored for several weeks as they prepared for the circumnavigating voyage ahead by careening their ship, Golden Hind, so to effectively clean and repair the hull. Drake had friendly interactions with the Coast Miwok and explored the surrounding land by foot. When his ship was ready for the return voyage, Drake and the crew left New Albion on 23 July and paused his journey the next day when anchoring his ship at the Farallon Islands where the crew hunted seal meat.\nAcross the Pacific and around Africa.\nDrake left the Pacific coast, heading southwest to catch the winds that would carry his ship across the Pacific, and a few months later reached the Moluccas, a group of islands in the western Pacific, in eastern modern-day Indonesia. At this time Diego died from wounds he had sustained earlier in the voyage, Drake was saddened at his death having become a good friend. \"Golden Hind\" later became caught on a reef and was almost lost. After the sailors waited three days for convenient tides and had dumped cargo. Befriending Sultan Babullah of Ternate in the Moluccas, Drake and his men became involved in some intrigues with the Portuguese there. He made multiple stops on his way toward the tip of Africa, eventually rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and reached Sierra Leone by 22 July 1580.\nReturn to Plymouth (1580).\nOn 26 September, \"Golden Hind\" sailed into Plymouth with Drake and 59\u00a0remaining crew aboard, along with a rich cargo of spices and captured Spanish treasures. The Queen's half-share of the cargo surpassed the rest of the crown's income for that entire year. Drake was hailed as the first Englishman to circumnavigate the Earth (and the second such voyage arriving with at least one ship intact, after Elcano's in 1520).\nThe Queen declared that all written accounts of Drake's voyages were to become the Queen's secrets of the Realm, and Drake and the other participants of his voyages on the pain of death sworn to their secrecy; she intended to keep Drake's activities away from the eyes of rival Spain. Drake presented the Queen with a jewel token commemorating the circumnavigation. Taken as a prize off the Pacific coast of Mexico, it was made of enamelled gold and bore an African diamond and a ship with an ebony hull.\nFor her part, the Queen gave Drake a jewel with her portrait, an unusual gift to bestow upon a commoner, and one that Drake sported proudly in his 1591 portrait by Marcus Gheeraerts now at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. On one side is a state portrait of Elizabeth by the miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard, on the other a sardonyx cameo of double portrait busts, a regal woman and an African male. The \"Drake Jewel\", as it is known today, is a rare documented survivor among sixteenth-century jewels; it is conserved at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\nKnighthood and arms.\nQueen Elizabeth awarded Drake a knighthood aboard \"Golden Hind\" in Deptford on 4 April 1581; the dubbing being performed by a French diplomat, Monsieur de Marchaumont, who was negotiating for Elizabeth to marry the King of France's brother, Francis, Duke of Anjou. By getting the French diplomat involved in the knighting, Elizabeth was gaining the implicit political support of the French for Drake's actions. During the Victorian era, in a spirit of nationalism, the story was promoted that Elizabeth I had done the knighting.\nAfter receiving his knighthood Drake unilaterally adopted the armorials of the ancient Devon family of Drake of Ash, near Musbury, to whom he claimed a distant but unspecified kinship. These arms were: \"Argent, a wyvern wings displayed and tail nowed gules\", and the crest, \"a dexter arm Proper grasping a battle axe Sable, headed Argent\". The head of that family, also a distinguished sailor, Sir Bernard Drake (d.1586), angrily refuted Sir Francis's claimed kinship and his right to bear his family's arms. That dispute led to \"a box on the ear\" being given to Sir Francis by Sir Bernard at court, as recorded by John Prince (1643\u20131723) in his \"Worthies of Devon\", first published in 1701. Queen Elizabeth, to assuage matters, awarded Sir Francis his own coat of arms, blazoned as follows:\nThe motto, \"Sic Parvis Magna\", translated literally, is: \"Thus great things from small things (come)\". The hand out of the clouds, labelled \"Auxilio Divino\", means \"With Divine Help\". The full achievement is depicted in the form of a large coloured plaster overmantel in the Lifetimes Gallery at Buckland Abbey\nNevertheless, Drake continued to quarter his new arms with the wyvern gules. The arms adopted by his nephew Sir Francis Drake, 1st Baronet (1588\u20131637) of Buckland were the arms of Drake of Ash, but the wyvern without a \"nowed\" (knotted) tail.\nPurchase of Buckland Abbey.\nIn 1580, Drake purchased Buckland Abbey, a large manor house near Yelverton in Devon, via intermediaries from Sir Richard Greynvile. He lived there for fifteen years, until his final voyage, and it remained in his family for several generations. Buckland Abbey is now in the care of the National Trust and a number of mementos of his life are displayed there.\nPolitical career.\nDrake was politically astute, and although known for his private and military endeavours, he was an influential figure in politics during the time he spent in Britain. Often abroad, there is little evidence to suggest he was active in Westminster, despite being a member of parliament on three occasions.\nAfter returning from his voyage of circumnavigation, Drake became the Mayor of Plymouth, in September 1581. He became a member of parliament during a session of the 4th Parliament of Elizabeth I, on 16 January 1581, for the constituency of Camelford. He did not actively participate at this point, and on 17 February 1581 he was granted leave of absence \"for certain his necessary business in the service of Her Majesty\".\nDrake became a member of parliament again in 1584 for Bossiney on the forming of the 5th Parliament of Elizabeth I. He served the duration of the parliament and was active in issues regarding the navy, fishing, early American colonisation, and issues related chiefly to Devon. He spent the time covered by the next two parliamentary terms engaged in other duties and an expedition to Portugal.\nHe became a member of parliament for Plymouth in 1593. He was active in issues of interest to Plymouth as a whole, but also to emphasise defence against the Spanish.\nGreat Expedition to America.\nWar had already been declared by Phillip II after the Treaty of Nonsuch, so the Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish colonies in a kind of preemptive strike. An expedition left Plymouth in September 1585 with Drake in command of twenty-one ships with 1,800 soldiers under Christopher Carleill. He first attacked Vigo in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. He then plundered Santiago in the Cape Verde islands after which the fleet then sailed across the Atlantic, sacked the port of Santo Domingo, and captured the city of Cartagena de Indias in present-day Colombia. At Cartagena, Drake released one hundred Turks held as slaves. On 6 June 1586, during the return leg of the voyage, he raided the Spanish fort of San Agust\u00edn in Spanish Florida.\nAfter the raids he then went on to find Sir Walter Raleigh's settlement much further north at Roanoke which he replenished and also took back with him all of the original colonists before Sir Richard Greynvile arrived with supplies and more colonists. He finally reached England on 22 July, when he sailed into Portsmouth, England to a hero's welcome.\nSpanish Armada.\nAngered by these acts, Philip II ordered a planned invasion of England.\nC\u00e1diz raid.\nOn 15 March 1587, Drake accepted a new commission with several purposes: disrupt the shipping routes to slow supplies from Italy and Andalusia to Lisbon, to trouble enemy fleets that were in their own ports, and to capture Spanish ships laden with treasure. Drake was also to confront and attack the Spanish Armada had it already sailed for England. When arriving at Cadiz on 19 April, Drake found the harbour packed with ships and supplies as the Armada was readying and waiting for fair wind to launch the fleet to attack. In the early hours of the next day, Drake pressed his attack into the inner harbour and inflicted heavy damage. Claims of the Spanish ship losses vary. Drake claimed he had sunk 39 ships, but other contemporary sources are lower, specifically some Spanish sources which suggest losses as low as 25 ships. The attack became known as the \u201csingeing of the King\u2019s beard\u201d and delayed the Spanish invasion by a year.\nOver the next month, Drake patrolled the Iberian coasts between Lisbon and Cape St. Vincent, intercepting and destroying ships on the Spanish supply lines. Drake estimated that he captured around 1600\u20131700 tons of barrel staves, enough to make 25,000 to for containing provisions.\nDefeat of the Spanish Armada.\nDrake was vice admiral in command of the English fleet (under Lord Howard of Effingham) when it overcame the Spanish Armada that was attempting to invade England in 1588. As the English fleet pursued the Armada up the English Channel in closing darkness, Drake broke off and captured the Spanish galleon \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario\", along with Admiral Pedro de Vald\u00e9s and all his crew. The Spanish ship was known to be carrying substantial funds to pay the Spanish Army in the Low Countries. Drake's ship had been leading the English pursuit of the Armada by means of a lantern. By extinguishing this for the capture, Drake put the fleet into disarray overnight.\nOn the night of 29 July, along with Howard, Drake organised fire-ships, causing the majority of the Spanish captains to break formation and sail out of Calais into the open sea. The next day, Drake was present at the Battle of Gravelines. He wrote as follows to Admiral Henry Seymour after coming upon part of the Spanish Armada, whilst aboard \"Revenge\" on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 OS):\nComing up to them, there has passed some common shot between some of our fleet and some of them; and as far as we perceive, they are determined to sell their lives with blows.\nThe most famous (but probably apocryphal) anecdote about Drake relates that, prior to the battle, he was playing a game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe. On being warned of the approach of the Spanish fleet, Drake is said to have remarked that there was plenty of time to finish the game and still beat the Spaniards, perhaps because he was waiting for high tide. There is no known eyewitness account of this incident and the earliest retelling of it was printed 37 years later. Adverse winds and currents caused some delay in the launching of the English fleet as the Spanish drew nearer, perhaps prompting a popular myth of Drake's cavalier attitude to the Spanish threat. It might also have been later ascribed to the stoic attribute of British culture.\nDrake\u2013Norris Expedition also known as the English Armada.\nIn 1589, the year after defeating the Armada the English sent their own to attack Spain, Drake and Sir John Norreys were given three tasks: seek out and destroy the remaining ships, support the rebels in Lisbon, Portugal against King Philip II (then king of Spain and Portugal), and take the Azores if possible. In the Siege of Coru\u00f1a Drake and Norreys destroyed a few ships in the harbour of A Coru\u00f1a in Spain but lost more than 12,000 lives and 20 ships. This defeat in all fronts delayed Drake, and he was forced to forgo hunting the rest of the surviving ships and head on to Lisbon.\nHowever, he wanted to change such a bitter thorn and, in order not to return empty-handed and with the morale of his troops sunk, he made a fleeting stop in the Galician r\u00edas, razing the defenseless town of Vigo to the ground without mercy for four days. His crew, without a government and eager for revenge, inflicted cruelty on the town until it was reduced to ashes. Even this abusive demonstration of power did not leave the corsair unharmed, as he lost some five hundred men on land, in addition to as many wounded. The growing defense of the inhabitants and the arrivals of militias from Portugal, put the ships in retreat again.\nAfter an investigation was opened in England to try to clarify the causes of the disaster, Drake, whose behavior was harshly criticized by his comrades in arms, was relegated to the modest post of commander of the coastal defenses of Plymouth, being denied the command of any naval expedition for the next six years.\nDefeats and death.\nDrake's seafaring career continued into his mid-fifties. In 1595, he failed to conquer the port of Las Palmas, and following a disastrous campaign against Spanish America, where he suffered a number of defeats, he unsuccessfully attacked San Juan de Puerto Rico, eventually losing the Battle of San Juan.\nThe Spanish gunners from El Morro Castle shot a cannonball through the cabin of Drake's flagship, but he survived. He attempted to attack over land in an effort to capture the rich port of Panam\u00e1 but was defeated again. A few weeks later, on 28 January 1596, he died (aged about 56) of dysentery, a common disease in the tropics at the time, while anchored off the coast of Portobelo where some Spanish treasure ships had sought shelter. Following his death, the English fleet withdrew.\nBefore dying, he asked to be dressed in his full armour. He was buried at sea in a sealed lead-lined coffin, near Portobelo, a few miles off the coastline. It is supposed that his final resting place is near the wrecks of two British ships, the \"Elizabeth\" and the \"Delight\", scuttled in Portobelo Bay. Divers continue to search for the coffin. Drake's body has never been recovered.\nCultural impact.\nIn Valpara\u00edso, Chile, folklore associates a cave known as Cueva del Pirata (lit. \"Cave of the Pirate\") with Francis Drake. A legend says that when Drake sacked the port he became disappointed over the scant plunder. Drake proceeded to enter the churches in fury to sack them and urinate on the goblets. However he still found the plunder to be not worth enough to take it on board his galleon, hiding it in the cave. Another version the legend says a treasure was left in the cave because the plunder had been more than he could take on board. Together with the treasure Drake would have left a man chained or a sentry to wait for them to return, which they did not. The treasure is said to still be there, but those who approach it drown.\nFurther north in Chile a tale says that because Drake feared falling prisoner to the Spanish he buried his treasure near Arica, these being one of many Chilean stories about entierros (\"burrowings\").\nIn the UK there are various places named after him, especially in Plymouth, Devon. Places there carrying his name include the naval base , Drake's Island, and a shopping centre and roundabout named Drake Circus. Plymouth Hoe is also home to a statue of Drake.\nIn the United States Drakes Bay and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard of Marin County, California are both named after him, as well as the high school in San Anselmo, California. The boulevard runs between Drakes Bay at Point Reyes to Point San Quentin on San Francisco Bay. There is a recent local movement to rename the boulevard and the high school because of Drake's slave trader past. A large hotel in Union Square, San Francisco also bears his name. Additionally, the Sir Francis Drake Channel in the British Virgin Islands bears his name.\nIn British Columbia, Canada, where some theorise he may also have landed to the north of the usual site considered to be Nova Albion, various mountains were named in the 1930s for him, or in connection with Elizabeth I or other figures of that era, including Mount Sir Francis Drake, Mount Queen Bess, and the Golden Hinde, the highest mountain on Vancouver Island.\nDrake's will was the focus of a vast confidence scheme which Oscar Hartzell perpetrated in the 1920s and 1930s. He convinced thousands of people, mostly in the American Midwest, that Drake's fortune was being held by the British government, and had compounded to a huge amount. If their last name was Drake they might be eligible for a share if they paid Hartzell to be their agent. The swindle continued until a copy of Drake's will was brought to Hartzell's mail fraud trial and he was convicted and imprisoned.\nDrake's Drum has become an icon of English folklore with its variation of the classic King asleep in mountain story motif.\nDrake was a major focus in the video game series \"Uncharted\", specifically its first and third instalments, ' and ', respectively. The series follows Nathan Drake, a self-proclaimed descendant of Drake who retraces his ancestor's voyages.\nDrake was the subject of a TV series, \"Sir Francis Drake\" (1961-1962). Terence Morgan played Drake in the 26-episode adventure drama."}
{"id": "11512", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11512", "title": "Fast Fourier transform", "text": "A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by factorizing the DFT matrix into a product of sparse (mostly zero) factors. As a result, it manages to reduce the complexity of computing the DFT from formula_1, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to formula_2, where formula_3 is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where \"N\" may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of round-off error, many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple complex-number arithmetic to group theory and number theory.\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for applications in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805. In 1994, Gilbert Strang described the FFT as \"the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime\", and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the IEEE magazine \"Computing in Science &amp; Engineering\".\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the factorization of \"N\", but there are FFTs with O(\"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\") complexity for all \"N\", even for prime\u00a0\"N\". Many FFT algorithms depend only on the fact that formula_4 is an \"N\"-th primitive root of unity, and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any finite field, such as number-theoretic transforms. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/\"N\" factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.\nHistory.\nThe development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to Carl Friedrich Gauss's unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids Pallas and Juno from sample observations. His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by James Cooley and John Tukey, who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even Joseph Fourier's results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.\nBetween 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. Frank Yates in 1932 published his version called \"interaction algorithm\", which provided efficient computation of Hadamard and Walsh transforms. Yates' algorithm is still used in the field of statistical design and analysis of experiments. In 1942, G. C. Danielson and Cornelius Lanczos published their version to compute DFT for x-ray crystallography, a field where calculation of Fourier transforms presented a formidable bottleneck. While many methods in the past had focused on reducing the constant factor for formula_1 computation by taking advantage of \"symmetries\", Danielson and Lanczos realized that one could use the \"periodicity\" and apply a \"doubling trick\" to get formula_2 runtime.\nJames Cooley and John Tukey published a more general version of FFT in 1965 that is applicable when \"N\" is composite and not necessarily a power of 2. Tukey came up with the idea during a meeting of President Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, an FFT algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, Richard Garwin recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3. Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at IBM's Watson labs) for implementation. Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short time of six months. As Tukey did not work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.\nDefinition.\nLet \"x\"0, \u2026, \"x\"\"N\"\u22121 be complex numbers. The DFT is defined by the formula\nwhere formula_8 is a primitive th root of 1.\nEvaluating this definition directly requires formula_1 operations: there are \"N\" outputs \"X\"\"k\", and each output requires a sum of \"N\" terms. An FFT is any method to compute the same results in formula_2 operations. All known FFT algorithms require \u0398formula_11 operations, although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible.\nTo illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions for N=4096 data points. Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves \"N\"2 complex multiplications and \"N\"(\"N\" \u2212 1) complex additions, of which formula_12 operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1, leaving about 30 million operations. In contrast, the radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm, for \"N\" a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (\"N\"/2)log2(\"N\") complex multiplications (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and \"N\"\u00a0log2(\"N\") complex additions, in total about 30,000 operations a thousand times less than with direct evaluation. In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (for example, see Frigo &amp; Johnson, 2005), but the overall improvement from formula_1 to formula_2 remains.\nAlgorithms.\nCooley\u2013Tukey algorithm.\nBy far the most commonly used FFT is the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm. This is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively breaks down a DFT of any composite size \"N\" = \"N\"1\"N\"2 into many smaller DFTs of sizes \"N\"1 and \"N\"2, along with O(\"N\") multiplications by complex roots of unity traditionally called twiddle factors (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966).\nThis method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of Cooley and Tukey in 1965, but it was later discovered that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to Carl Friedrich Gauss around 1805 (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).\nThe best known use of the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size \"N\"/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey). These are called the \"radix-2\" and \"mixed-radix\" cases, respectively (and other variants such as the split-radix FFT have their own names as well). Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below.\nOther FFT algorithms.\nThere are FFT algorithms other than Cooley\u2013Tukey. Cornelius Lanczos did pioneering work on the FFT and FFS (fast Fourier sampling method) with G. C. Danielson (1940).\nFor \"N\" = \"N\"1\"N\"2 with coprime \"N\"1 and \"N\"2, one can use the prime-factor (Good\u2013Thomas) algorithm (PFA), based on the Chinese remainder theorem, to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooley\u2013Tukey but without the twiddle factors. The Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm (1976) is a Cooley\u2013Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary twiddle factors, reducing multiplications at the cost of increased additions and reduced numerical stability; it was later superseded by the split-radix variant of Cooley\u2013Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and QFT algorithms. (The Rader\u2013Brenner and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite \"N\". Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.) Bruun's algorithm, in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the polynomial \"z\"\"N\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form \"z\"\"M\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 and \"z\"2\"M\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"az\"\"M\"\u00a0+\u00a01.\nAnother polynomial viewpoint is exploited by the Winograd FFT algorithm, which factorizes \"z\"\"N\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 into cyclotomic polynomials\u2014these often have coefficients of 1,\u00a00,\u00a0or\u00a0\u22121, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(\"N\") irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern processors with hardware multipliers. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of \"prime\" sizes.\nRader's algorithm, exploiting the existence of a generator for the multiplicative group modulo prime \"N\", expresses a DFT of prime size \"N\" as a cyclic convolution of (composite) size \"N\" \u2212 1, which can then be computed by a pair of ordinary FFTs via the convolution theorem (although Winograd uses other convolution methods). Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the chirp-z algorithm; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the \"same\" size (which can be zero-padded to a power of two and evaluated by radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity\nHexagonal fast Fourier transform (HFFT) aims at computing an efficient FFT for the hexagonally-sampled data by using a new addressing scheme for hexagonal grids, called Array Set Addressing (ASA).\nFFT algorithms specialized for real or symmetric data.\nIn many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry\nand efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987). One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory. Alternatively, it is possible to express an \"even\"-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(\"N\") post-processing operations.\nIt was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the discrete Hartley transform (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs. Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.\nThere are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have even/odd symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of roughly two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the discrete cosine/sine transform(s) (DCT/DST). Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(\"N\") pre- and post-processing.\nComputational issues.\nBounds on complexity and operation counts.\nA fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the complexity and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require \u03a9(\"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\") (i.e., order \"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\" or greater) operations, even for the simple case of power of two sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as cache or CPU pipeline optimization.\nFollowing work by Shmuel Winograd (1978), a tight \u0398(\"N\") lower bound is known for the number of real multiplications required by an FFT. It can be shown that only formula_17 irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length formula_18. Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman &amp; Burrus, 1986; Duhamel, 1990). However, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers (Duhamel, 1990; Frigo &amp; Johnson, 2005).\nA tight lower bound is not known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern proved an \u03a9(\"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\") lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of formula_19), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix) under the same scaling. Pan (1986) proved an \u03a9(\"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\") lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's \"asynchronicity\", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two \"N\", Papadimitriou (1979) argued that the number formula_20 of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithms is \"optimal\" under certain assumptions on the graph of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited). (This argument would imply that at least formula_21 real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than formula_20 complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two\u00a0\"N\".\nA third problem is to minimize the \"total\" number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the \"arithmetic complexity\" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered). Again, no tight lower bound has been proven. Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two \"N\" was long achieved by the split-radix FFT algorithm, which requires formula_23 real multiplications and additions for \"N\" &gt; 1. This was recently reduced to formula_24 (Johnson and Frigo, 2007; Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007). A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for \"N\" \u2265 256) was shown to be provably optimal for \"N\" \u2264 512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a satisfiability modulo theories problem solvable by brute force (Haynal &amp; Haynal, 2011).\nMost of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest. However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, discrete cosine transforms, discrete Hartley transforms, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel &amp; Vetterli, 1990).\nApproximations.\nAll of the FFT algorithms discussed above compute the DFT exactly (i.e. neglecting floating-point errors). A few \"FFT\" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT \"approximately\", with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations. Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties. For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999) achieves lower communication requirements for parallel computing with the help of a fast multipole method. A wavelet-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996) takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT. Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995). The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data. Conversely, if the data are sparse\u2014that is, if only \"K\" out of \"N\" Fourier coefficients are nonzero\u2014then the complexity can be reduced to O(\"K\"log(\"N\")log(\"N\"/\"K\")), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for \"N\"/\"K\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a032 in a large-\"N\" example (\"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0222) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest \"K\" coefficients to several decimal places).\nAccuracy.\nFFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the pairwise summation structure of the algorithms. The upper bound on the relative error for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is O(\"\u03b5\" log \"N\"), compared to O(\"\u03b5N\"3/2) for the na\u00efve DFT formula, where \u03b5 is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the root mean square (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(\"\u03b5\" ) for Cooley\u2013Tukey and O(\"\u03b5\" ) for the na\u00efve DFT (Schatzman, 1996). These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the trigonometric function values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate trigonometric recurrence formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley\u2013Tukey, such as the Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.\nIn fixed-point arithmetic, the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O() for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969). Achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling to minimize loss of precision, and fixed-point FFT algorithms involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooley\u2013Tukey.\nTo verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(\"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\") time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Erg\u00fcn, 1995).\nMultidimensional FFTs.\nAs defined in the multidimensional DFT article, the multidimensional DFT\ntransforms an array \"x\"n with a \"d\"-dimensional vector of indices formula_26 by a set of \"d\" nested summations (over formula_27 for each \"j\"), where the division n/N, defined as formula_28, is performed element-wise. Equivalently, it is the composition of a sequence of \"d\" sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).\nThis compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the row-column algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below). That is, one simply performs a sequence of \"d\" one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the \"n\"1 dimension, then along the \"n\"2 dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering works). This method is easily shown to have the usual O(\"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\") complexity, where formula_29 is the total number of data points transformed. In particular, there are \"N\"/\"N\"1 transforms of size \"N\"1, etcetera, so the complexity of the sequence of FFTs is:\nIn two dimensions, the \"x\"k can be viewed as an formula_31 matrix, and this algorithm corresponds to first performing the FFT of all the rows (resp. columns), grouping the resulting transformed rows (resp. columns) together as another formula_31 matrix, and then performing the FFT on each of the columns (resp. rows) of this second matrix, and similarly grouping the results into the final result matrix.\nIn more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for cache locality to group the dimensions recursively. For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar \"slice\" for each fixed \"n\"1, and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the \"n\"1 direction. More generally, an asymptotically optimal cache-oblivious algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups formula_33 and formula_34 that are transformed recursively (rounding if \"d\" is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005). Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(\"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\") complexity. Yet another variation is to perform matrix transpositions in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for out-of-core and distributed memory situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.\nThere are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(\"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\") complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the vector-radix FFT algorithm, which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector formula_35 of radices at each step. (This may also have cache benefits.) The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides \"all\" of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary. Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. formula_36, is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977), which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products. See Duhamel and Vetterli (1990) for more information and references.\nOther generalizations.\nAn O(\"N\"5/2log\u00a0\"N\") generalization to spherical harmonics on the sphere \"S\"2 with \"N\"2 nodes was described by Mohlenkamp, along with an algorithm conjectured (but not proven) to have O(\"N\"2 log2(\"N\")) complexity; Mohlenkamp also provides an implementation in the libftsh library. A spherical-harmonic algorithm with O(\"N\"2log\u00a0\"N\") complexity is described by Rokhlin and Tygert.\nThe fast folding algorithm is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values. Rotation (which in the FFT is multiplication by a complex phasor) is a circular shift of the component waveform.\nVarious groups have also published \"FFT\" algorithms for non-equispaced data, as reviewed in Potts \"et al.\" (2001). Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a non-uniform discrete Fourier transform, or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately). More generally there are various other methods of spectral estimation.\nApplications.\nThe FFT is used in digital recording, sampling, additive synthesis and pitch correction software.\nThe FFT's importance derives from the fact that it has made working in the frequency domain equally computationally feasible as working in the temporal or spatial domain. Some of the important applications of the FFT include:\nSee also.\nFFT-related algorithms:\nFFT implementations:\nOther links:"}

As of the 2011 Census, Fort William had a population of 10,459, making it the second largest settlement in the Highland council area, and the second largest settlement in the whole of the Scottish Highlands; only the city of Inverness has a larger population.\nFort William is a major tourist centre, with Glen Coe just to the south, to the east and Glenfinnan to the west, on the Road to the Isles. It is a centre for hillwalking and climbing due to its proximity to Ben Nevis and many other Munro mountains. It is also known for its nearby downhill mountain bike track. It is the start/end of both the West Highland Way (Milngavie \u2013 Fort William) and the Great Glen Way (a walk/cycle way Fort William\u2013Inverness).\nAround 726 people (7.33% of the population) can speak Gaelic.\nOrigins.\nThe earliest recorded settlement on the site is a Cromwellian wooden fort built in 1654 as a base for British troops to \"pacify\" Clan Cameron after the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The post-Glorious Revolution fort was named Fort William after William of Orange, who ordered that it be built to control the Highland clans. The settlement that grew around it was called Maryburgh, after his wife Mary II of England. This settlement was later renamed Gordonsburgh, and then Duncansburgh before being renamed Fort William, this time after Prince William, Duke of Cumberland; known to some Scots as \"Butcher Cumberland\". Given these origins, there have been various suggestions over the years to rename the town (for example, to Invernevis).\nThe origin of the Gaelic name for Fort William, \"\", is not recorded but could be a loanword from the English \"garrison\", having entered common usage some time after the royal garrison was established, during the reign of William of Orange or perhaps after the earlier Cromwellian fort, or from the ultimately French-derived word \"garrison\", as at the earlier garrison at Inverlochy by the Scoto-Norman Clan Comyn.\nHistory.\nHistorically, this area of Lochaber was strongly Clan Cameron country, and there were a number of mainly Cameron settlements in the area (such as Blarmacfoldach). Before the building of the fort, Inverlochy was the main settlement in the area and was also where two battles took place\u2014the first Battle of Inverlochy in 1431 and the second Battle of Inverlochy in 1645.\nThe town grew in size as a settlement when the fort was constructed to control the population after Oliver Cromwell's invasion during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and then to suppress the Jacobite uprisings of the 18th century.\nDuring the 1745 Jacobite Rising, known as the Forty-Five, Fort William was besieged for two weeks by the Jacobites, from 20 March to 3 April 1746. However, although the Jacobites had captured both of the other forts in the chain of three Great Glen fortifications (Fort Augustus and the original Fort George), they failed to take Fort William. \nDuring the Second World War, Fort William was the home of , which was a training base for Royal Navy Coastal Forces.\nMore on the history of the town and the region can be found in the West Highland Museum on the High Street.\nFort William is the northern end of the West Highland Way, a long-distance route which runs through the Scottish Highlands to Milngavie, on the outskirts of Glasgow, and the start/end point of the Great Glen Way, which runs between Fort William and Inverness.\nOn 2 June 2006, a fire destroyed McTavish's Restaurant in Fort William High Street along with the two shops which were part of the building. The restaurant had been open since the 1970s and prior to that the building had been Fraser's Cafe since the 1920s. Development work began in 2012 on new hotel accommodation and street-level shops, and these opened in 2014.\nFuture development.\nA \"Waterfront\" development was proposed by the council, but there was no overwhelming support for this in the town. The development would have included a hotel, some shops and some housing, but it was stated early in 2008 that it was unlikely to be completed before 2020. It was announced in April 2010 that the project had been abandoned.\nGeography.\nOriginally based on the still-extant village of Inverlochy, the town lies at the southern end of the Great Glen, Fort William lies near the head of Loch Linnhe, one of Scotland's longest sea lochs, beside the mouth of the rivers Nevis and Lochy. They join in the intertidal zone and briefly become one river before discharging to the sea. The town and its suburbs are surrounded by picturesque mountains. It is also on the shore of Loch Eil. It is close to Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the British Isles, Glen Nevis and the town of Achnaphubuil, is on the opposite shore of the loch. When the railway opened to Fort William on 7 August 1894, the station was given prime position at the south end of the town. The consequence was that the town was separated from the lochside by railway tracks until the 1970s, when the present by-pass was built, and the station was re-located to the north end.\nThe town is centred on the High Street, which was pedestrianised in the 1990s. Off this, there are several squares: Monzie Square (named after the Cameron Campbells of Monzie, Perthshire, former landowners in the town); Station Square, where the long-since demolished railway station used to be; Gordon Square (named after the Gordons, who in the late 18th century owned land where the town now stands, when the town was named Gordonsburgh); and Cameron Square\u2014formerly known as Town Hall Square. There is also Fraser Square, which is not so square-like, since it now opens out into Middle Street, but which still houses the Imperial Hotel.\nThe main residential areas of the town are unseen from the High Street and from the A82 main road. Upper Achintore and the Plantation spread steeply uphill from above the high street.\nInverlochy, Claggan, An-Aird, Lochyside, Caol, Banavie and Corpach outwith (i.e. outside) the town are the other main residential areas. These areas are built on much flatter land than the town.\nGlenfinnan, away, is home of the Glenfinnan Monument (Jacobite era) and the famous Glenfinnan Viaduct (as seen on a Bank Of Scotland \u00a310 note). The viaduct has become known to millions in recent years as the \"Harry Potter Bridge\" after it featured in the films of the books by J.K. Rowling, specifically \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\". Glenfinnan has also been used in \"Charlotte Gray\" and \"Highlander\".\nJust outside the town is a large aluminium plant operated by Alcan and powered by the Lochaber hydroelectric scheme, in its day the biggest tunnelling project in the world. This was formerly served by the Lochaber Narrow Gauge Railway better known locally as the Puggy Line.\nTransport.\nThe West Highland Line passes through Fort William. Owing to the difficult terrain in the area, the line from Glasgow, to the south, enters from the northeast. Trains from Glasgow to Mallaig, the terminus of the line, have to reverse at Fort William railway station.\nAn overnight train, the Caledonian sleeper, has its terminus at Fort William. This service is known colloquially as 'The Deerstalker'.\nThe stands for local buses and express coaches are on MacFarlane Way adjacent to the railway station.\nThe Caledonian Canal connects the Scottish east coast at Inverness with the west coast at Corpach near Fort William.\nThe corran ferry crosses Loch Linnhe, connecting the A82 to A861.\nFort William is located on the A82. The closest motorway access is at junction 12 of the M90 near Perth to the southeast.\nSports.\nClimbing.\nFort William and the surrounding area is a year-round destination for climbers from all over the world. The draw of nearby Ben Nevis is irresistible to anyone, from first time climbers to professional winter climbers. When the weather halts any attempt for outdoor climbing, Three Wise Monkeys Climbing, the climbing wall in the centre of town, offers sanctuary for anyone of any age or experience.\nMountain biking.\nJust outside the town, parallel to the Nevis Range Gondola, there is a large downhill mountain bike track which attracts thousands of visitors every year, including international competitors and fans.\nEach year since 2002, Fort William has hosted a round of UCI Mountain Bike World Cup, and in 2007 it hosted the UCI Mountain Bike &amp; Trials World Championships ('The Worlds'). Also a trials competition is held, at the various courses at the bottom.\nFort William has also hosted the World Endurance Mountain Bike Organisation (WEMBO) solo 24 hour championship, in 2014 and again in 2018. The event consists of riders racing for a full 24 hours and is won by the rider completing the greater number of laps.\nMotorcycle trials.\nFort William is the home of the Scottish Six Day Motorcycle Trial (SSDT), held annually in the first full week of May. It attracts many competitors from all across the globe and in 2011 the event celebrated its centenary year.\nOthers.\nFort William has two major shinty teams, Fort William Shinty Club and Kilmallie Shinty Club. It also has a football team, Fort William F.C., that competes in the Scottish Highland Football League and plays home games at Claggan Park. There is also a cricket club at Fort William that participates in the North of Scotland Cricket Association league (NoSCA).\nIn addition, the town is home to Lochaber Rugby Club and to the Lochaber Yacht Club, a Community Amateur Sports Club that was founded in 1954. The town also has one golf club, called Fort William Golf Club, which has eighteen holes and is open year-round. It also hosts weekly competitions.\nAs a film location.\nMovies filmed in or near Fort William include \"Being Human\", \"Braveheart\", \"Highlander\", \"Restless Natives\", \"Harry Potter\" and \"Rob Roy\". The TV series \"Rockface\" was filmed mainly around Fort William and some scenes of \"Monarch of the Glen\" were filmed around Lochaber, although mostly near Newtonmore. \"Local Hero\" shot the internal Houston scenes in Fort William.\nFestivals.\nIn a celebration of mountains and the culture that surrounds them, and in recognition of the importance of climbing and walking tourism to the town, the Fort William Mountain Festival is held there each year. For a number of years, this volunteer-led festival has concentrated mostly around film but, starting in the Year of Highland Culture \u2013 Highland 2007, its scope was widened, and it dropped the word 'film' from its title.\nEducation.\nLochaber High School is the local high school and serves a large catchment area which includes the surrounding villages.\nWest Highland College is part of the University of the Highlands &amp; Islands. It hosts the School of Adventure Studies (SOAS) offering both FE courses &amp; HE honours degrees.\nClimate.\nFort William has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\") with moderate, but generally cool, temperatures and abundant precipitation. Fort William is one of the wettest locations in the British Isles with December being the wettest month."}

Although the financial rand was abolished in March 1995, some capital controls remain in place. These capital controls are locally referred to as \"exchange controls\", although the system has since 1995 moved towards surveillance \u2014 recording and reporting to the authorities of foreign currency transactions \u2014 rather than control.\nCapital controls have been in place in South Africa in various guises on an uninterrupted basis since the outbreak of World War II, when Great Britain and its dominions implemented the Sterling area.\nFollowing the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, South Africa experienced significant outflows of foreign exchange on the capital account of the balance of payments and instituted an additional level of capital controls, known as the Blocked Rand system. This had the principal effect of blocking outflows of capital to the other countries in the Sterling Area, notably Britain.\nTo some extent the Blocked Rand system mirrored Germany's Reichsbank system introduced under Hjalmar Schacht in 1937, called \"aski\" accounts \u2014 short for \"Ausl\u00e4nder Sonderkonten f\u00fcr Inlandszahlungen\" (\"foreigners' special accounts for inland payments\"). In other words, creating a closed loop system that did not create a claim on the foreign exchange reserves of the Third Reich, or in this case South Africa.\nThe report of the De Kock Commission on Exchange Controls tabled in November 1978, proposed a gradual easing of exchange controls. This saw the replacement of the Blocked Rand by the Financial Rand in early 1979. In line with this policy, the Financial Rand itself was abolished in 1983 and non-residents could repatriate the majority of their South African investments via the Commercial Rand.\nThis easing was, however, short-lived and the Financial Rand system was re-introduced on 1 September 1985. The outflows during 1984\u20131985 were largely the result of economic sanctions in response to apartheid. At the same time, the government enacted the exchange controls. Investments in South Africa by foreigners could only be sold for financial rand.\nThe financial rand system provided for two exchange rates for the rand \u2014 one for current account transactions and one for capital account transactions for non-residents. Investments made in South Africa by non-residents could only be sold for financial rand, and limitations were placed on the convertibility of financial rand into foreign currencies. Financial rand had the ISO 4217 currency code ZAL. Financial rand had a previous life, from January 1979 to February 1983. The 1985 crisis coincided with a default (then called a \"standstill\") on foreign debt by the apartheid government."}

It lies about halfway between mainland Shetland and Orkney. It is known for its bird observatory and a traditional style of knitting. The island has been owned by the National Trust for Scotland since 1954.\nGeography.\n the most remote inhabited island in the United Kingdom. It is administratively part of the parish of Dunrossness, Shetland, and is roughly equidistant from Sumburgh Head, some to the northeast on the Mainland of Shetland and North Ronaldsay, Orkney, some to the southwest. Fair Isle is long and wide. It has an area of , making it the tenth largest of the Shetland Islands. It gives its name to one of the British Sea Areas.\nMost of the islanders live in the crofts on the southern half of the island, with the northern half consisting of rocky moorland. The western coast consists of cliffs of up to in height, with Ward Hill at being the highest point of the island and its only Marilyn. On the eastern coast the almost detached headland of Sheep Rock rises to .\nHistory.\nFair Isle has been occupied since Neolithic times, which is remarkable because of the lack of raw materials on the island, although it is surrounded by rich fishing waters. There are two known Iron Age sites: a promontory fort at Landberg and the foundations of a house underlying an early Christian settlement at Kirkigeo.\nMost of the place names date from after the 9th century Norse settlement of the Northern Isles. By that time the croft lands had clearly been in use for centuries.\nBetween the 9th and 15th centuries, Fair Isle was a Norwegian possession. In 1469, Shetland, along with Orkney, was part of the dowry of the King of Denmark's daughter, Margaret, on her marriage to James III of Scotland.\nOn 20 August 1588 the flagship of the Spanish Armada, \"El Gran Grif\u00f3n\", was shipwrecked in the cove of Stroms Hellier, forcing its 300 sailors to spend six weeks living with the islanders. The wreck was discovered in 1970. The large Canadian sailing ship \"Black Watch\" was wrecked on Fair Isle in 1877.\nFair Isle was bought by the National Trust for Scotland in 1954 from George Waterston, the founder of the bird observatory. In that decade, electricity was not yet available to residents and only some homes had running water; the population was declining at a level that created concern.\nThe population decreased steadily from about 400 in 1900. There were around 55 permanent residents on the island in 2015, the majority of whom are crofters. That had increased to about 70 by March 2020. The island has 14 scheduled monuments, ranging from the earliest signs of human activity to the remains of a Second World War radar station. The two automated lighthouses are protected as listed buildings.\nThe island houses a series of high-technology relay stations carrying vital TV, radio, telephone and military communication links between Shetland, Orkney and the Scottish mainland. In this respect it continues its historic role as a signal station, linking the mainland and the more remote island groups. In 1976, when television relay equipment was updated to permit colour broadcasts to Shetland, the new equipment was housed in former World War Two radar station buildings on Fair Isle. Many television signals are relayed from Orkney to Shetland (rather than from the Scottish mainland) via Orkney's Keelylang Hill transmitter station.\nWartime military role.\nDuring the Second World War, the Royal Air Force built a radar station on top of Ward Hill () during the Battle of the Atlantic. The ruined buildings and Nissen huts are still present. A cable-operated narrow gauge railway lies disused, though it was once used to send supplies up to the summit of Ward Hill.\nOn 17 January 1941, a German Heinkel He 111 bomber, modified as a meteorological aircraft, crashed on the island; wreckage remains on the crash-site to the present day. The aircraft had been flying on a routine weather reconnaissance flight from its base at Oldenburg in Germany. It was intercepted by RAF Hawker Hurricane fighters from 3 Squadron, based at RAF Sumburgh; both of the aircraft's engines were damaged and several of the five crew were wounded. The pilot managed to make a crash-landing on Fair Isle to avoid ditching his crippled aircraft in the sea. Two crew died and three survived. The dead crew were buried in the island's churchyard; the survivors were detained by the islanders and remained for several days until weather conditions allowed them to be taken off the island by means of the Shetland Lifeboat.\nThe South Light was a target. During raids, the wife of an assistant keeper was killed in 1941 and their daughter was injured; in 1942, the wife of another keeper and their daughter also died in a raid.\nOn 22 July 1941 Spitfire X5401 piloted by F/O M.D.S Hood DFC crash-landed on Fair Isle returning from a reconnaisance mission over Aalesland Norway. The pilot recalled the crash site to be adjacent to the track which crossed the airstrip. The cause of the crash proved to be leaking coolant which resulted in the engine overheating. The aircraft was recovered and flew again and the pilot survived the war.\nEconomy.\nOver the centuries the island has changed hands many times. Trading links with Northern Europe are reflected in Fair Isle Haa, a traditional Hanseatic trading booth located not far from the South Harbour, traditionally used by residents of the southern part of the island. Rent was usually paid to absentee landlords (who rarely visited) in butter, cloth and fish oil.\nFishing has always been an important industry for the island. In 1702, the Dutch, who were interested in Shetland's herring fisheries, fought a naval battle against French warships just off the island.\nFair Isle is also noted for its woollen jumpers, with knitting forming an important source of income for the women of the islands. The principal activity for the male islanders is crofting.\nIn January 2004, Fair Isle was granted Fairtrade Island status.\nBird life.\nMany rare species of bird have been found on the island, with at least 27 species found on the island that were the first British records, and is probably the best place in western Europe to see skulking Siberian passerines such as Pechora pipit, lanceolated warbler and Pallas's grasshopper warbler. \nFor example, in 2015, rare birds discovered on the island included pallid harrier, arctic warbler, Moltoni's warbler, booted warbler, paddyfield warbler, siberian thrush and thrush nightingale.\nThe island is also home to an endemic subspecies of Eurasian wren, the Fair Isle wren \"Troglodytes troglodytes fridariensis\".\nBird observatory.\nA permanent bird observatory was founded on Fair Isle by George Waterston in 1948. Because of its importance as a bird migration watchpoint, it provided most of the accommodation on the island. The first director of the observatory was Kenneth Williamson. It was unusual amongst bird observatories in providing catered, rather than hostel-style, accommodation.\nIn 2010, a new observatory was built: a wooden lodge of two storeys, which cost \u00a34\u00a0million and accommodated around 30 guests. The 2010 observatory building was destroyed by fire on 10 March 2019; the observatory's records had been digitised and were not affected. The cost of rebuilding was estimated at \u00a37.4m.\nInfrastructure.\nOther than the restaurant of the Bird Observatory, and its little evening-only bar, there are no pubs or restaurants on the island. There is one shop, and one school (see below). There is a community hall available for meetings and social events. There is no police station on the island; the main station is Lerwick and a section station is located in the village of Brae.\nPassenger service to the island is provided by NorthLink Ferries on the vessel \"Good Shepherd IV\" or by a nine-seat passenger aeroplane from Tingwall Airport near Lerwick, operated by regional carrier Directflight.\nElectricity supply.\nFair Isle is not connected to the National Grid and electricity is provided by the Fair Isle Electricity Company. From the 1980s, power was generated by two diesel generators and two wind turbines. Diesel generators were automatically switched off if wind turbines provided sufficient power. Excess capacity was distributed through a separate network for home heating, with remote frequency-sensitive programmable relays controlling water heaters and storage heaters in the buildings of the community. Since October 2018, the island has a 24-hour electricity supply; following the installation of three wind turbines, combined with solar panels and batteries, in a \u00a33.5 million scheme.\nCommunication.\nFair Isle is home to two GSM 900\u00a0MHz base stations operated by Vodafone and O2. On 16 April 2019, an EE 4G antenna was turned on by Openreach.\nEmergency services.\nFair Isle has a fire station equipped with a single fire appliance, and staffed by a retained fire crew of local volunteers. It was originally part of the Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service, which was absorbed into the national Scottish Fire and Rescue Service on 1 April 2013. A locally organised volunteer fire brigade was formed in 1996 by island residents. This was later absorbed into the statutory fire service, with professional training provided, and the local service designated a retained fire crew. The first purpose-built fire engine was stationed to the island in 2002.\nIn October 2011 a contract for the construction of a \u00a3140,000 purpose-built fire station was awarded to Shetland company Ness Engineering, who completed the construction and equipping of the fire station, including its connection to the island power and water supplies, and the installation of a rainwater harvesting system within the building. The new fire station was officially opened on 14 March 2013.\nThere is a small Coastguard cliff-rescue team on the island. Like the fire service, the Coastguard is a retained (volunteer) emergency service. The Fair Isle Coastguard cliff rescue team were the first British Coastguard unit to be equipped with a quad ATV. The quad is painted in H M Coastguard livery, with reflective Battenburg markings and has an optional equipment trailer.\nThere are no emergency medical services on Fair Isle. Routine medical care is provided by a community nurse. In the event of accident and emergency the community nurse provides first aid until casualties can be removed to Shetland Mainland, usually by helicopter air ambulance. In severe weather conditions or life-threatening emergencies the Coastguard helicopter can undertake the patient evacuation.\nTransport.\nAir.\nFair Isle Airport serves the island with flights to Tingwall Airport near Lerwick, and weekly to Sumburgh Airport, both on Shetland Mainland. Flights to Kirkwall on Orkney were scheduled to begin in September 2017, provided by Loganair. Private aircraft use the facility and scheduled flights arrive twice daily, three days a week. There is a small terminal building, but facilities are otherwise very limited. Fire cover is provided by the island fire service.\nThere is also a helipad at the South Fair Isle lighthouse, for official use by the Northern Lighthouse Board and Coastguard helicopters, and a second one at the North Fair Isle lighthouse.\nSea.\nThere are two main harbours (north harbour and south harbour), both formed naturally, being sheltered by the headland of Bu Ness. They are separated by a narrow isthmus of gravel. The north harbour is the main route for goods, provisions, and Royal Mail postal services arriving at and departing from the island. The ferry \"Good Shepherd IV\" plies between Fair Isle north harbour and Grutness on Shetland Mainland. In summer only, the ferry also runs from Lerwick once every two weeks.\nRoad.\nA road connects the populated areas of the island, along its full length.\nEducation.\nFair Isle has one primary school, with two classrooms. There is a full-time head teacher, and a part-time assistant teacher. The number of pupils varies over time, but has generally been between 5 and 10, with 4 pupils as of early 2020. Islanders of secondary school age are generally educated off-island, on Shetland Mainland, where they board in halls of residence, returning to the island during holiday periods.\nReligion.\nChristianity is the only formally organised religion on Fair Isle. There are two churches, one Methodist, and one Church of Scotland (Presbyterian). The Methodist Church has a resident non-stipendiary minister, who reports to a full-time minister on Shetland Mainland. The Methodist Church was constructed in 1886.\nThe Church of Scotland church was built in 1892. The Church of Scotland parish which contains Fair Isle is Dunrossness, which is linked with Sandwick, Cunningsburgh and Quarff parish. The congregation's minister is the Reverend Charles H Greig.\nClimate.\nFair Isle experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfb\", bordering on a subpolar oceanic climate (\"Cfc\"), with cool summers and mild winters. This is especially pronounced due to its location far from any sizeable landmass; Fair Isle has the smallest overall temperature range (least continental) of any weather station in the British Isles: an absolute maximum of and an absolute minimum of since 1951. This 60+ year temperature span is actually smaller than many places in inland southern England will record within a given three-month period. To further illustrate how extreme the maritime moderation at Fair Isle is, a rural location near the coastline in Northern Stockholm County on a similar latitude in Sweden broke Fair Isle's all-time records in both directions within a 48-hour period between 26 and 28 April 2014. \nThe lowest temperature recorded in recent years was in February 2010. Rainfall, at under , is lower than one might expect for somewhere often in the main path of Atlantic depressions. This is explained by a lack of heavy convective rainfall during spring and summer months due to the absence of warm surface conditions.\nFair Isle's ocean moderation is so strong that areas on the same latitudes in the Scandinavian inland less than to the east have average summer highs higher than Fair Isle's all-time record temperature, for example the Norwegian capital of Oslo and the Swedish capital of Stockholm. The all-time low is uniquely mild for European locations on the 59th parallel north. The winter daily means are comparable to many areas as far south in the British Isles as south-central England, due to the extreme maritime moderation.\nConservation designations.\nMost of the island is designated by NatureScot as both a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SCA). The island and its surrounding seas are also designated by NatureScot as a Special Protection Area (SPA) due to the important bird species present.\nIn 2016 the seas around Fair Isle were designated as a Marine Protected Area (MPA). As of 2019 it is the only MPA in Scotland to be designated specifically as a \"Demonstration and Research\" MPA. The aims of this MPA designation are defined as being: "}
{"id": "11520", "revid": "1494661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11520", "title": "Four Feather Falls", "text": "Four Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for Granada Television (now both ITV Studios and ITV plc respectively). It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two of the feathers allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, whilst the other two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog.\nTex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series was sporadically repeated on British television until 1968, and was released on DVD in 2005.\nProduction.\nAmerican Western television shows such as \"Wagon Train\" and \"Gunsmoke\" were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, \"Supercar\".\nThe puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in \"Four Feather Falls\" had oversized heads.\nExcept for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white. Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving.\nContinuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson.\nPlot.\nThe series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to his grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya, and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather, Chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson. Two of the feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically (often while Tex's hands are raised), and the other two allow his horse, Rocky, and his dog, Dusty, to speak. As Tex, his horse, and dog are very thirsty, Kalamakooya also makes a waterfall where there had been no water before, and so when the town was built it was named after Tex's feathers and the waterfall.\nThe characters of the town are Grandpa Twink, who does little but rest in a chair; his grandson Little Jake, the only child in town; Ma Jones, who runs the town store; Doc Haggerty; Slim Jim, the bartender of the Denison saloon; Marvin Jackson, the bank manager; and Dan Morse, the telegraphist. Other characters appeared from time to time for only one episode, often just visiting town. The villains included Pedro, who was introduced in the first show and Fernando, who first appeared in the second episode as a sidekick and someone Pedro could blame when things went wrong, as they always did. Big Ben was another villain who appeared from time to time, as did Red Scalp, a renegade Indian. Other villains only appeared in single episodes.\nCast.\nDenise Bryer had worked with Anderson on \"The Adventures of Twizzle\", and he wanted her to play some of the voices in \"Four Feather Falls\". Anderson visited Bryer at her home with some scripts and asked her husband, Nicholas Parsons, to help by reading some of the other parts, including the sheriff Tex Tucker. Anderson liked Parsons' interpretation and offered him the job of providing Tex's speaking voice.\nMusic.\nThe show's music and song lyrics were composed by Barry Gray. Michael Holliday provided Tex's singing voice, and Tommy Reilly performed the harmonica pieces. The best known song to come out of the series was \"Four Feather Falls\", sung in some episodes by Michael Holliday in the style of Bing Crosby and sometimes incorrectly described as the theme song to the series. The closing theme song was \"Two Gun Tex of Texas.\" Holliday was paid \u00a32000 for his singing work on the pilot episode, equivalent to about \u00a338,000 as of 2010, a significant part of the show's \u00a36000 budget. In all, Holliday recorded six songs for the series: \"Four Feather Falls\", \"The Phantom Rider\", \"The Rick-Rick-A-Rackety Train\", \"Happy Hearts and Friendly Faces\", \"My Home Town\", and \"Two Gun Tex of Texas\".\nSyndication.\nThe series was repeated in some British TV regions on a sporadic basis up until 1968. In December 2004, it was announced that the rights had been acquired by Network, and it was released on three Region 2 DVDs in May 2005. It is the only Supermarionation series not yet released to DVD in North America as of January 2006. Sylvia Anderson wrote two British children's annuals based on the show, published by Collins in 1960 and 1961. The first book featured a short text story based on the pilot episode of the TV series.\nIn other media.\nThe show was adapted into comics form and published as an ongoing strip in Polystyle Publications' \"TV Comic\". The \"Four Feathers Falls\" strip was drawn by Neville Main, and appeared from issue #439 (14 May 1960) until issue #564 (6 October 1962).\nReferences.\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography"}
{"id": "11522", "revid": "187158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11522", "title": "Fly-by-wire", "text": "Fly-by-wire (FBW) is a system that replaces the conventional manual flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires, and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the ordered response. It can use mechanical flight control backup systems (like the Boeing 777) or use fully fly-by-wire controls.\nImproved fully fly-by-wire systems interpret the pilot's control inputs as a desired outcome and calculate the control surface positions required to achieve that outcome; this results in various combinations of rudder, elevator, aileron, flaps and engine controls in different situations using a closed feedback loop. The pilot may not be fully aware of all the control outputs acting to effect the outcome, only that the aircraft is reacting as expected. The fly-by-wire computers act to stabilise the aircraft and adjust the flying characteristics without the pilot's involvement and to prevent the pilot operating outside of the aircraft's safe performance envelope.\nRationale.\nMechanical and hydro-mechanical flight control systems are relatively heavy and require careful routing of flight control cables through the aircraft by systems of pulleys, cranks, tension cables and hydraulic pipes. Both systems often require redundant backup to deal with failures, which increases weight. Both have limited ability to compensate for changing aerodynamic conditions. Dangerous characteristics such as stalling, spinning and pilot-induced oscillation (PIO), which depend mainly on the stability and structure of the aircraft concerned rather than the control system itself, are dependent on pilot's action.\nThe term \"fly-by-wire\" implies a purely electrically signaled control system. It is used in the general sense of computer-configured controls, where a computer system is interposed between the operator and the final control actuators or surfaces. This modifies the manual inputs of the pilot in accordance with control parameters.\nSide-sticks or conventional flight control yokes can be used to fly FBW aircraft.\nWeight saving.\nA FBW aircraft can be lighter than a similar design with conventional controls. This is partly due to the lower overall weight of the system components and partly because the natural stability of the aircraft can be relaxed, slightly for a transport aircraft, and more for a maneuverable fighter, which means that the stability surfaces that are part of the aircraft structure can therefore be made smaller. These include the vertical and horizontal stabilizers (fin and tailplane) that are (normally) at the rear of the fuselage. If these structures can be reduced in size, airframe weight is reduced. The advantages of FBW controls were first exploited by the military and then in the commercial airline market. The Airbus series of airliners used full-authority FBW controls beginning with their A320 series, see A320 flight control (though some limited FBW functions existed on A310). Boeing followed with their 777 and later designs.\nBasic operation.\nClosed-loop feedback control.\nA pilot commands the flight control computer to make the aircraft perform a certain action, such as pitch the aircraft up, or roll to one side, by moving the control column or sidestick. The flight control computer then calculates what control surface movements will cause the plane to perform that action and issues those commands to the electronic controllers for each surface. The controllers at each surface receive these commands and then move actuators attached to the control surface until it has moved to where the flight control computer commanded it to. The controllers measure the position of the flight control surface with sensors such as LVDTs.\nAutomatic stability systems.\nFly-by-wire control systems allow aircraft computers to perform tasks without pilot input. Automatic stability systems operate in this way. Gyroscopes fitted with sensors are mounted in an aircraft to sense rotation on the pitch, roll and yaw axes. Any movement (from straight and level flight for example) results in signals to the computer, which can automatically move control actuators to stabilize the aircraft.\nSafety and redundancy.\nWhile traditional mechanical or hydraulic control systems usually fail gradually, the loss of all flight control computers immediately renders the aircraft uncontrollable. For this reason, most fly-by-wire systems incorporate either redundant computers (triplex, quadruplex etc.), some kind of mechanical or hydraulic backup or a combination of both. A \"mixed\" control system with mechanical backup feedbacks any rudder elevation directly to the pilot and therefore makes closed loop (feedback) systems senseless.\nAircraft systems may be quadruplexed (four independent channels) to prevent loss of signals in the case of failure of one or even two channels. High performance aircraft that have fly-by-wire controls (also called CCVs or Control-Configured Vehicles) may be deliberately designed to have low or even negative stability in some flight regimes rapid-reacting CCV controls can electronically stabilize the lack of natural stability.\nPre-flight safety checks of a fly-by-wire system are often performed using built-in test equipment (BITE). A number of control movement steps can be automatically performed, reducing workload of the pilot or groundcrew and speeding up flight-checks.\nSome aircraft, the Panavia Tornado for example, retain a very basic hydro-mechanical backup system for limited flight control capability on losing electrical power; in the case of the Tornado this allows rudimentary control of the stabilators only for pitch and roll axis movements.\nHistory.\nServo-electrically operated control surfaces were first tested in the 1930s on the Soviet Tupolev ANT-20. Long runs of mechanical and hydraulic connections were replaced with wires and electric servos.\nThe first pure electronic fly-by-wire aircraft with no mechanical or hydraulic backup was the Apollo Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV), first flown in 1968.\nThe first non-experimental aircraft that was designed and flown (in 1958) with a fly-by-wire flight control system was the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, a feat not repeated with a production aircraft (though the Arrow was cancelled with five built) until Concorde in 1969, which became the first fly-by-wire airliner. This system also included solid-state components and system redundancy, was designed to be integrated with a computerised navigation and automatic search and track radar, was flyable from ground control with data uplink and downlink, and provided artificial feel (feedback) to the pilot.\nIn the UK the two seater Avro 707C was flown with a Fairey system with mechanical backup in the early to mid-60s. The program was curtailed when the air-frame ran out of flight time.\nIn 1972, the first digital fly-by-wire fixed-wing aircraft without a mechanical backup to take to the air was an F-8 Crusader, which had been modified electronically by NASA of the United States as a test aircraft; the F-8 used the Apollo guidance, navigation and control hardware.\nThis was preceded in 1964 by the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV) which pioneered fly-by-wire flight with no mechanical backup. Control was through a digital computer with three analog redundant channels. In the USSR, the Sukhoi T-4 also flew. At about the same time in the United Kingdom a trainer variant of the British Hawker Hunter fighter was modified at the British Royal Aircraft Establishment with fly-by-wire flight controls for the right-seat pilot.\nThe Airbus A320 began service in 1988 as the first airliner with digital fly-by-wire controls.\nAnalog systems.\nAll \"fly-by-wire\" flight control systems eliminate the complexity, the fragility and the weight of the mechanical circuit of the hydromechanical or electromechanical flight control systems \u2014 each being replaced with electronic circuits. The control mechanisms in the cockpit now operate signal transducers, which in turn generate the appropriate electronic commands. These are next processed by an electronic controller\u2014either an analog one, or (more modernly) a digital one. Aircraft and spacecraft autopilots are now part of the electronic controller.\nThe hydraulic circuits are similar except that mechanical servo valves are replaced with electrically controlled servo valves, operated by the electronic controller. This is the simplest and earliest configuration of an analog fly-by-wire flight control system. In this configuration, the flight control systems must simulate \"feel\". The electronic controller controls electrical feel devices that provide the appropriate \"feel\" forces on the manual controls. This was used in Concorde, the first production fly-by-wire airliner.\nDigital systems.\nA digital fly-by-wire flight control system can be extended from its analog counterpart. Digital signal processing can receive and interpret input from multiple sensors simultaneously (such as the altimeters and the pitot tubes) and adjust the controls in real time. The computers sense position and force inputs from pilot controls and aircraft sensors. They then solve differential equations related to the aircraft's equations of motion to determine the appropriate command signals for the flight controls to execute the intentions of the pilot.\nThe programming of the digital computers enable flight envelope protection. These protections are tailored to an aircraft's handling characteristics to stay within aerodynamic and structural limitations of the aircraft. For example, the computer in flight envelope protection mode can try to prevent the aircraft from being handled dangerously by preventing pilots from exceeding preset limits on the aircraft's flight-control envelope, such as those that prevent stalls and spins, and which limit airspeeds and g forces on the airplane. Software can also be included that stabilize the flight-control inputs to avoid pilot-induced oscillations.\nSince the flight-control computers continuously feedback the environment, pilot's workloads can be reduced. This also enables military aircraft with relaxed stability. The primary benefit for such aircraft is more maneuverability during combat and training flights, and the so-called \"carefree handling\" because stalling, spinning and other undesirable performances are prevented automatically by the computers. Digital flight control systems enable inherently unstable combat aircraft, such as the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk and the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit flying wing to fly in usable and safe manners.\nLegislation.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States has adopted the RTCA/DO-178C, titled \"Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification\", as the certification standard for aviation software. Any safety-critical component in a digital fly-by-wire system including applications of the laws of aeronautics and computer operating systems will need to be certified to DO-178C Level A or B, depending on the class of aircraft, which is applicable for preventing potential catastrophic failures.\nNevertheless, the top concern for computerized, digital, fly-by-wire systems is reliability, even more so than for analog electronic control systems. This is because the digital computers that are running software are often the only control path between the pilot and aircraft's flight control surfaces. If the computer software crashes for any reason, the pilot may be unable to control an aircraft. Hence virtually all fly-by-wire flight control systems are either triply or quadruply redundant in their computers and electronics. These have three or four flight-control computers operating in parallel and three or four separate data buses connecting them with each control surface.\nRedundancy.\nThe multiple redundant flight control computers continuously monitor each other's output. If one computer begins to give aberrant results for any reason, potentially including software or hardware failures or flawed input data, then the combined system is designed to exclude the results from that computer in deciding the appropriate actions for the flight controls. Depending on specific system details there may be the potential to reboot an aberrant flight control computer, or to reincorporate its inputs if they return to agreement. Complex logic exists to deal with multiple failures, which may prompt the system to revert to simpler back-up modes.\nIn addition, most of the early digital fly-by-wire aircraft also had an analog electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic back-up flight control system. The Space Shuttle has, in addition to its redundant set of four digital computers running its primary flight-control software, a fifth back-up computer running a separately developed, reduced-function, software flight-control system \u2013 one that can be commanded to take over in the event that a fault ever affects all of the computers in the other four. This back-up system serves to reduce the risk of total flight-control-system failure ever happening because of a general-purpose flight software fault that has escaped notice in the other four computers.\nEfficiency of flight.\nFor airliners, flight-control redundancy improves their safety, but fly-by-wire control systems, which are physically lighter and have lower maintenance demands than conventional controls also improve economy, both in terms of cost of ownership and for in-flight economy. In certain designs with limited relaxed stability in the pitch axis, for example the Boeing 777, the flight control system may allow the aircraft to fly at a more aerodynamically efficient angle of attack than a conventionally stable design. Modern airliners also commonly feature computerized Full-Authority Digital Engine Control systems (FADECs) that control their jet engines, air inlets, fuel storage and distribution system, in a similar fashion to the way that FBW controls the flight control surfaces. This allows the engine output to be continually varied for the most efficient usage possible.\nThe second generation Embraer E-Jet family gained a 1.5% efficiency improvement over the first generation from the fly-by-wire system, which enabled a reduction from 280\u00a0ft.\u00b2 to 250\u00a0ft.\u00b2 for the horizontal stabilizer on the E190/195 variants.\nAirbus/Boeing.\nAirbus and Boeing differ in their approaches to implementing fly-by-wire systems in commercial aircraft. Since the Airbus A320, Airbus flight-envelope control systems always retain ultimate flight control when flying under normal law and will not permit the pilots to violate aircraft performance limits unless they choose to fly under alternate law. This strategy has been continued on subsequent Airbus airliners. However, in the event of multiple failures of redundant computers, the A320 does have a mechanical back-up system for its pitch trim and its rudder, the Airbus A340 has a purely electrical (not electronic) back-up rudder control system and beginning with the A380, all flight-control systems have back-up systems that are purely electrical through the use of a \"three-axis Backup Control Module\" (BCM).\nBoeing airliners, such as the Boeing 777, allow the pilots to completely override the computerised flight-control system, permitting the aircraft to be flown outside of its usual flight-control envelope.\nEngine digital control.\nThe advent of FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) engines permits operation of the flight control systems and autothrottles for the engines to be fully integrated. On modern military aircraft other systems such as autostabilization, navigation, radar and weapons system are all integrated with the flight control systems. FADEC allows maximum performance to be extracted from the aircraft without fear of engine misoperation, aircraft damage or high pilot workloads.\nIn the civil field, the integration increases flight safety and economy. Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft are protected from dangerous situations such as low-speed stall or overstressing by flight envelope protection. As a result, in such conditions, the flight control systems commands the engines to increase thrust without pilot intervention. In economy cruise modes, the flight control systems adjust the throttles and fuel tank selections precisely. FADEC reduces rudder drag needed to compensate for sideways flight from unbalanced engine thrust. On the A330/A340 family, fuel is transferred between the main (wing and center fuselage) tanks and a fuel tank in the horizontal stabilizer, to optimize the aircraft's center of gravity during cruise flight. The fuel management controls keep the aircraft's center of gravity accurately trimmed with fuel weight, rather than drag-inducing aerodynamic trims in the elevators.\nFurther developments.\nFly-by-optics.\nFly-by-optics is sometimes used instead of fly-by-wire because it offers a higher data transfer rate, immunity to electromagnetic interference and lighter weight. In most cases, the cables are just changed from electrical to optical fiber cables. Sometimes it is referred to as \"fly-by-light\" due to its use of fiber optics. The data generated by the software and interpreted by the controller remain the same. Fly-by-light has the effect of decreasing electro-magnetic disturbances to sensors in comparison to more common fly-by-wire control systems. The Kawasaki P-1 is the first production aircraft in the world to be equipped with such a flight control system.\nPower-by-wire.\nHaving eliminated the mechanical transmission circuits in fly-by-wire flight control systems, the next step is to eliminate the bulky and heavy hydraulic circuits. The hydraulic circuit is replaced by an electrical power circuit. The power circuits power electrical or self-contained electrohydraulic actuators that are controlled by the digital flight control computers. All benefits of digital fly-by-wire are retained since the power-by-wire components are strictly complementary to the fly-by-wire components.\nThe biggest benefits are weight savings, the possibility of redundant power circuits and tighter integration between the aircraft flight control systems and its avionics systems. The absence of hydraulics greatly reduces maintenance costs. This system is used in the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and in Airbus A380 backup flight controls. The Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 also incorporate electrically powered backup flight controls which remain operational even in the event of a total loss of hydraulic power.\nFly-by-wireless.\nWiring adds a considerable amount of weight to an aircraft; therefore, researchers are exploring implementing fly-by-wireless solutions. Fly-by-wireless systems are very similar to fly-by-wire systems, however, instead of using a wired protocol for the physical layer a wireless protocol is employed.\nIn addition to reducing weight, implementing a wireless solution has the potential to reduce costs throughout an aircraft's life cycle. For example, many key failure points associated with wire and connectors will be eliminated thus hours spent troubleshooting wires and connectors will be reduced. Furthermore, engineering costs could potentially decrease because less time would be spent on designing wiring installations, late changes in an aircraft's design would be easier to manage, etc.\nIntelligent flight control system.\nA newer flight control system, called intelligent flight control system (IFCS), is an extension of modern digital fly-by-wire flight control systems. The aim is to intelligently compensate for aircraft damage and failure during flight, such as automatically using engine thrust and other avionics to compensate for severe failures such as loss of hydraulics, loss of rudder, loss of ailerons, loss of an engine, etc. Several demonstrations were made on a flight simulator where a Cessna-trained small-aircraft pilot successfully landed a heavily damaged full-size concept jet, without prior experience with large-body jet aircraft. This development is being spearheaded by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. It is reported that enhancements are mostly software upgrades to existing fully computerized digital fly-by-wire flight control systems. The Dassault Falcon 7X and Embraer Legacy 500 business jets have flight computers that can partially compensate for engine-out scenarios by adjusting thrust levels and control inputs, but still require pilots to respond appropriately."}
{"id": "11523", "revid": "5891765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11523", "title": "Falklands War", "text": "The Falklands War () was a 10-week undeclared war between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1982 over two British dependent territories in the South Atlantic: the Falkland Islands and its territorial dependency, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The result of the war was a British victory.\nThe conflict began on 2\u00a0April, when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands, followed by the invasion of South Georgia the next day. On 5\u00a0April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74\u00a0days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14\u00a0June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649\u00a0Argentine military personnel, 255\u00a0British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities.\nThe conflict was a major episode in the protracted dispute over the territories' sovereignty. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory, and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th\u00a0century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty. Neither state officially declared war, although both governments declared the Islands a war zone.\nThe conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books, articles, films, and songs. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the unfavourable outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government, hastening its downfall and the democratisation of the country. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative government, bolstered by the successful outcome, was re-elected with an increased majority the following year. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it has remained a common topic for discussion.\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid, at which the two governments issued a joint statement. No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994, Argentina adopted a new Constitution, which declared the Falkland Islands by law as an Argentine province. However, the islands continue to operate as a self-governing British Overseas Territory.\nPrelude.\nFailed diplomacy.\nIn 1965, the United Nations called upon Argentina and the United Kingdom to reach a settlement of the sovereignty dispute. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) regarded the islands as a nuisance and barrier to UK trade in South America, so, whilst confident of British sovereignty, was prepared to cede the islands to Argentina. When news of a proposed transfer broke in 1968, elements sympathetic with the plight of the islanders were able to organise an effective Parliamentary lobby to frustrate the FCO plans. Negotiations continued but in general failed to make meaningful progress; the islanders steadfastly refused to consider Argentine sovereignty on one side, whilst Argentina would not compromise over sovereignty on the other. The FCO then sought to make the islands dependent on Argentina, hoping this would make the islanders more amenable to Argentine sovereignty. A Communications Agreement signed in 1971 created an airlink and later YPF, the Argentine oil company, was given a monopoly in the islands.\nIn 1980, a new Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Nicholas Ridley, went to the Falklands trying to sell the islanders the benefits of a leaseback scheme, which met with strong opposition from the islanders. On returning to London in December 1980 he reported to parliament but was viciously attacked at what was seen as a sellout. (It was unlikely that leaseback could have succeeded since the British had sought a long-term lease of 99 years, whilst Argentina was pressing for a much shorter period of only 10 years.) At a private committee meeting that evening, it was reported that Ridley cried out: \"If we don't do something, they will invade. And there is nothing we could do.\"\nThe Argentine junta.\nIn the period leading up to the war\u2014and, in particular, following the transfer of power between the military dictators General Jorge Rafael Videla and General Roberto Eduardo Viola late in March 1981\u2014Argentina had been in the midst of devastating economic stagnation and large-scale civil unrest against the military \"junta\" that had been governing the country since 1976.\nIn December 1981 there was a further change in the Argentine military regime, bringing to office a new \"junta\" headed by General Leopoldo Galtieri (acting president), Air Brigadier Basilio Lami Dozo and Admiral Jorge Anaya. Anaya was the main architect and supporter of a military solution for the long-standing claim over the islands, calculating that the United Kingdom would never respond militarily.\nBy opting for military action, the Galtieri government hoped to mobilise the long-standing patriotic feelings of Argentines towards the islands, diverting public attention from the chronic economic problems and the ongoing human rights violations of its Dirty War, bolstering the junta's dwindling legitimacy. The newspaper \"La Prensa\" speculated on a step-by-step plan beginning with cutting off supplies to the islands, ending in direct actions late in 1982, if the UN talks were fruitless.\nThe ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on 19 March, when a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants (actually infiltrated by Argentine Marines) raised the Argentine flag at South Georgia Island, an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war. The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia on the 25th in response. The Argentine military junta, suspecting that the UK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces, ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands to be brought forward to 2 April.\nThe UK was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South Atlantic islands, despite repeated warnings by Royal Navy captain Nicholas Barker (commander of the \"Endurance\") and others. Barker believed that Defence Secretary John Nott's 1981 Defence White Paper (in which Nott described plans to withdraw the \"Endurance\", the UK's only naval presence in the South Atlantic) had sent a signal to the Argentines that the UK was unwilling, and would soon be unable, to defend its territories and subjects in the Falklands.\nArgentine invasion.\nOn 2 April 1982 Argentine forces mounted amphibious landings, known as Operation Rosario, on the Falkland Islands. The invasion was met with a nominal defence organised by the Falkland Islands' Governor Sir Rex Hunt, giving command to Major Mike Norman of the Royal Marines. The events of the invasion included the landing of Lieutenant Commander Guillermo Sanchez-Sabarots' Amphibious Commandos Group, the attack on Moody Brook barracks, the engagement between the troops of Hugo Santillan and Bill Trollope at Stanley, and the final engagement and surrender at Government House.\nInitial British response.\nThe British had already taken action prior to the 2 April invasion. In response to events on South Georgia, on 29 March, Ministers decided to send the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) \"Fort Austin\" south from the Mediterranean to support HMS \"Endurance\", and the submarine from Gibraltar, with ordered south from Scotland the following day. Lord Carrington had wished to send a third submarine, but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments. Coincidentally, on 26 March, the submarine left Gibraltar and it was assumed in the press it was heading south. There has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before nuclear-powered submarines could be deployed.\nThe following day, during a crisis meeting headed by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Henry Leach, advised them that \"Britain could and should send a task force if the islands are invaded\". On 1 April, Leach sent orders to a Royal Navy force carrying out exercises in the Mediterranean to prepare to sail south. Following the invasion on 2 April, after an emergency meeting of the cabinet, approval was given to form a task force to retake the islands. This was backed in an emergency session of the House of Commons the next day.\nWord of the invasion first reached the UK from Argentine sources. A Ministry of Defence operative in London had a short telex conversation with Governor Hunt's telex operator, who confirmed that Argentines were on the island and in control. Later that day, BBC journalist Laurie Margolis spoke with an islander at Goose Green via amateur radio, who confirmed the presence of a large Argentine fleet and that Argentine forces had taken control of the island. British military operations in the Falklands War were given the codename \"Operation Corporate\", and the commander of the task force was Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse. Operations lasted from 1 April 1982 to 20 June 1982.\nOn 6 April, the British Government set up a War Cabinet to provide day-to-day political oversight of the campaign. This was the critical instrument of crisis management for the British with its remit being to \"keep under review political and military developments relating to the South Atlantic, and to report as necessary to the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee\". The War Cabinet met at least daily until it was dissolved on 12 August. Although Margaret Thatcher is described as dominating the War Cabinet, Lawrence Freedman notes in the \"Official History of the Falklands Campaign\" that she did not ignore opposition or fail to consult others. However, once a decision was reached she \"did not look back\".\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 502.\nOn 31 March 1982, the Argentine ambassador to the UN, Eduardo Roca, tried garnering support against a British military build-up designed to thwart earlier UN resolutions calling for both countries to resolve their Falklands dispute through discussion. He did this because Argentina, based on inadequate intelligence gathering, was convinced a British task force was already on its way to the South Atlantic, and because of Britain's threat to use HMS \"Endurance\" to remove the scrap-metal workers from South Georgia. Any Argentine military action could then be justified as trying to counter Britain's use of force to evade complying with an earlier UN resolution. This Argentine approach to portray Britain as the aggressor came to nothing.\nOn 1 April, London told the UK ambassador to the UN, Sir Anthony Parsons, that an invasion was imminent and he should call an urgent meeting of the Security Council to get a favourable resolution against Argentina. Parsons had to get nine affirmative votes from the 15 Council members (not a simple majority) and to avoid a blocking vote from any of the other four permanent members. The meeting took place at 11.00am on 3 April, New York time (4.00pm in London). United Nations Security Council Resolution 502 was adopted by 10 to 1 (with Panama voting against) and 4 abstentions. Significantly, the Soviet Union and China both abstained. The resolution stated that the UN Security Council was: \nThis was a significant win for the UK, giving it the upper hand diplomatically. The draft resolution Parsons submitted had avoided any reference to the sovereignty dispute (which might have worked against the UK): instead it focused on Argentina's breach of Chapter VII of the UN Charter which forbids the threat or use of force to settle disputes. The resolution called for the removal only of Argentine forces: this freed Britain to retake the islands militarily, if Argentina did not leave, by exercising its right to self-defence, that was allowed under the UN Charter.\nBritish task force.\nThe British government had no contingency plan for an invasion of the islands, and the task force was rapidly put together from whatever vessels were available. The nuclear-powered submarine set sail from France on 4 April, whilst the two aircraft carriers and , in the company of escort vessels, left Portsmouth only a day later. On its return to Southampton from a world cruise on 7 April, the ocean liner was requisitioned and set sail two days later with 3 Commando Brigade aboard. The ocean liner \"Queen Elizabeth 2\" was also requisitioned and left Southampton on 12 May with 5th Infantry Brigade on board. The whole task force eventually comprised 127 ships: 43 Royal Navy vessels, 22 Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships and 62 merchant ships.\nThe retaking of the Falkland Islands was considered extremely difficult. The chances of a British counter-invasion succeeding were assessed by the US Navy, according to historian Arthur L. Herman, as \"a military impossibility\". Firstly, the British were significantly constrained by the disparity in deployable air cover. The British had 42 aircraft (28 Sea Harriers and 14 Harrier GR.3s) available for air combat operations, against approximately 122 serviceable jet fighters, of which about 50 were used as air superiority fighters and the remainder as strike aircraft, in Argentina's air forces during the war. Crucially, the British lacked airborne early warning and control (AEW) aircraft. Planning also considered the Argentine surface fleet and the threat posed by Exocet-equipped vessels or the two Type 209 submarines.\nBy mid-April, the Royal Air Force had set up the airbase of RAF Ascension Island, co-located with Wideawake Airfield on the mid-Atlantic British overseas territory of Ascension Island, including a sizeable force of Avro Vulcan B Mk 2 bombers, Handley Page Victor K Mk 2 refuelling aircraft, and McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR Mk 2 fighters to protect them. Meanwhile, the main British naval task force arrived at Ascension to prepare for active service. A small force had already been sent south to recapture South Georgia.\nEncounters began in April; the British Task Force was shadowed by Boeing 707 aircraft of the Argentine Air Force during their travel to the south. Several of these flights were intercepted by Sea Harriers outside the British-imposed Total Exclusion Zone; the unarmed 707s were not attacked because diplomatic moves were still in progress and the UK had not yet decided to commit itself to armed force. On 23 April, a Brazilian commercial Douglas DC-10 from VARIG Airlines en route to South Africa was intercepted by British Harriers who visually identified the civilian plane.\nRecapture of South Georgia and the attack on \"Santa Fe\".\nThe South Georgia force, Operation Paraquet, under the command of Major Guy Sheridan RM, consisted of Marines from 42 Commando, a troop of the Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) troops who were intended to land as reconnaissance forces for an invasion by the Royal Marines. All were embarked on . First to arrive was the HMS \"Conqueror\" on 19 April, and the island was over-flown by a radar-mapping Handley Page Victor on 20 April.\nThe first landings of SAS troops took place on 21 April, but\u2014with the southern hemisphere autumn setting in\u2014the weather was so bad that their landings and others made the next day were all withdrawn after two helicopters crashed in fog on Fortuna Glacier. On 23 April, a submarine alert was sounded and operations were halted, with \"Tidespring\" being withdrawn to deeper water to avoid interception. On 24 April, the British forces regrouped and headed in to attack.\nOn 25 April, after resupplying the Argentine garrison in South Georgia, the submarine was spotted on the surface by a Westland Wessex HAS Mk 3 helicopter from , which attacked the Argentine submarine with depth charges. launched a Westland Wasp HAS.Mk.1 helicopter, and launched a Westland Lynx HAS Mk 2. The Lynx launched a torpedo, and strafed the submarine with its pintle-mounted general purpose machine gun; the Wessex also fired on \"Santa Fe\" with its GPMG. The Wasp from as well as two other Wasps launched from fired AS-12 ASM antiship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. \"Santa Fe\" was damaged badly enough to prevent her from diving. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty at King Edward Point on South Georgia.\nWith \"Tidespring\" now far out to sea, and the Argentine forces augmented by the submarine's crew, Major Sheridan decided to gather the 76 men he had and make a direct assault that day. After a short forced march by the British troops and a naval bombardment demonstration by two Royal Navy vessels (\"Antrim\" and \"Plymouth\"), the Argentine forces surrendered without resistance. The message sent from the naval force at South Georgia to London was, \"Be pleased to inform Her Majesty that the White Ensign flies alongside the Union Jack in South Georgia. God Save the Queen.\" The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, broke the news to the media, telling them to \"Just rejoice at that news, and congratulate our forces and the Marines!\"\nBlack Buck raids.\nOn 1 May British operations on the Falklands opened with the \"Black Buck 1\" attack (of a series of five) on the airfield at Stanley. A Vulcan bomber from Ascension flew on an round trip dropping conventional bombs across the runway at Stanley and back to Ascension. The mission required repeated refuelling, and required several Victor K2 tanker aircraft operating in concert, including tanker-to-tanker refuelling. The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine, and the raids consumed precious tanker resources from Ascension, but also prevented Argentina from stationing fast jets on the islands.\nHistorian Lawrence Freedman, who was given access to official sources, comments that the significance of the Vulcan raids remains controversial. Although taking pressure off the small Sea Harrier force, the raids were costly and used a great deal of resources. The single hit in the centre of the runway was probably the best that could have been expected but it did reduce the capability of the runway to operate fast jets and caused the Argentine air force to deploy Mirage III to defend the capital. Argentine sources confirm that the Vulcan raids influenced Argentina to withdraw some of its Mirage IIIs from Southern Argentina to the Buenos Aires Defence Zone. This dissuasive effect was watered down when British officials made clear that there would not be strikes on air bases in Argentina. The raids were later dismissed as propaganda by Falklands veteran Commander Nigel Ward.\nOf the five Black Buck raids, three were against Stanley Airfield, with the other two anti-radar missions using Shrike anti-radiation missiles.\nEscalation of the air war.\nThe Falklands had only three airfields. The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, Stanley, and even that was too short to support fast jets (although an arrestor gear was fitted in April to support Skyhawks). Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, combat air patrols, and close air support over the islands. The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, and they were later compelled to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands.\nThe first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft (A-4 Skyhawks, IAI Daggers, English Electric Canberras, and Mirage III escorts), and was sent on 1 May, in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place. Only a section of Grupo 6 (flying IAI Dagger aircraft) found ships, which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands. The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely. This greatly boosted the morale of the Argentine pilots, who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships, protected by radar ground clutter from the islands and by using a late pop up profile. Meanwhile, other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by BAE Sea Harriers operating from . A Dagger and a Canberra were shot down.\nCombat broke out between Sea Harrier FRS Mk 1 fighters of No. 801 Naval Air Squadron and Mirage III fighters of Grupo 8. Both sides refused to fight at the other's best altitude, until two Mirages finally descended to engage. One was shot down by an AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile (AAM), while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland airbase. The plane made for Stanley, where it fell victim to friendly fire from the Argentine defenders.\nAs a result of this experience, Argentine Air Force staff decided to employ A-4 Skyhawks and Daggers only as strike units, the Canberras only during the night, and Mirage IIIs (without air refuelling capability or any capable AAM) as decoys to lure away the British Sea Harriers. The decoying would be later extended with the formation of the Escuadr\u00f3n F\u00e9nix, a squadron of civilian jets flying 24 hours a day, simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet. On one of these flights on 7 June, an Air Force Learjet 35A was shot down, killing the squadron commander, Vice Commodore Rodolfo De La Colina, the highest-ranking Argentine officer to die in the war.\nStanley was used as an Argentine strongpoint throughout the conflict. Despite the Black Buck and Harrier raids on Stanley airfield (no fast jets were stationed there for air defence) and overnight shelling by detached ships, it was never out of action entirely. Stanley was defended by a mixture of surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems (Franco-German Roland and British Tigercat) and Swiss-built Oerlikon 35 mm twin anti-aircraft cannons. Lockheed Hercules transport night flights brought supplies, weapons, vehicles, and fuel, and airlifted out the wounded up until the end of the conflict.\nThe only Argentine Hercules shot down by the British was lost on 1 June when TC-63 was intercepted by a Sea Harrier in daylight when it was searching for the British fleet north-east of the islands after the Argentine Navy retired its last SP-2H Neptune due to airframe attrition.\nVarious options to attack the home base of the five Argentine \u00c9tendards at R\u00edo Grande were examined and discounted (Operation Mikado); subsequently five Royal Navy submarines lined up, submerged, on the edge of Argentina's territorial limit to provide early warning of bombing raids on the British task force.\nSinking of ARA \"General Belgrano\".\nTwo British naval task forces (one of surface vessels and one of submarines) and the Argentine fleet were operating in the neighbourhood of the Falklands and soon came into conflict. The first naval loss was the Second World War-vintage Argentine light cruiser . The nuclear-powered submarine sank \"General Belgrano\" on 2 May. Three hundred and twenty-three members of \"General Belgrano\"s crew died in the incident. More than 700 men were rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather. The losses from \"General Belgrano\" totalled nearly half of the Argentine deaths in the Falklands conflict, and the loss of the ship hardened the stance of the Argentine government.\nRegardless of controversies over the sinking\u2014including disagreement about the exact nature of the maritime exclusion zone and whether \"General Belgrano\" had been returning to port at the time of the sinking\u2014it had a crucial strategic effect: the elimination of the Argentine naval threat. After her loss, the entire Argentine fleet, with the exception of the diesel-powered submarine , returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting. The two escorting destroyers and the battle group centred on the aircraft carrier both withdrew from the area, ending the direct threat to the British fleet that their pincer movement had represented.\nHowever, settling the controversy in 2003, the ship's captain Hector Bonzo confirmed that \"General Belgrano\" had actually been manoeuvering, not sailing away from the exclusion zone, and that the captain had orders to sink any British ship he could find.\nIn a separate incident later that night, British forces engaged an Argentine patrol gunboat, the , that was searching for the crew of the Argentine Air Force Canberra light bomber shot down on 1 May. Two Royal Navy Lynx helicopters fired four Sea Skua missiles at her. Badly damaged and with eight crew dead, \"Alferez Sobral\" managed to return to Puerto Deseado two days later. The Canberra's crew were never found.\nSinking of HMS \"Sheffield\".\nOn 4 May, two days after the sinking of \"General Belgrano\", the British lost the Type 42 destroyer to fire following an Exocet missile strike from the Argentine 2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron.\n\"Sheffield\" had been ordered forward with two other Type 42s to provide a long-range radar and medium-high altitude missile picket far from the British carriers. She was struck amidships, with devastating effect, ultimately killing 20 crew members and severely injuring 24 others. The ship was abandoned several hours later, gutted and deformed by the fires that continued to burn for six more days. She finally sank outside the Maritime Exclusion Zone on 10 May.\nThe incident is described in detail by Admiral Sandy Woodward in his book \"One Hundred Days\", in Chapter One. Woodward was a former commanding officer of \"Sheffield\". The destruction of \"Sheffield\" (the first Royal Navy ship sunk in action since the Second World War) had a profound impact on the British public, bringing home the fact that the \"Falklands Crisis\", as the BBC News put it, was now an actual \"shooting war\".\nDiplomatic activity.\nThe tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentines. The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary General P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar on 18 May 1982. In it, the British abandoned their previous \"red-line\" that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentine forces, as supported by United Nations Security Council Resolution 502.\nInstead, it proposed a UN administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both Argentine and British forces, then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands, including Argentines, although no Argentines lived there. Reference to \"self-determination\" of the islanders was dropped and the British proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the UN.\nSpecial forces operations.\nGiven the threat to the British fleet posed by the \u00c9tendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in some SAS troops to attack the home base of the five \u00c9tendards at R\u00edo Grande, Tierra del Fuego. The operation was codenamed \"Mikado\". The operation was later scrapped, after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a plan to use the submarine to drop SAS operatives several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina's remaining Exocet stockpile.\nAn SAS reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a seaborne infiltration. A Westland Sea King helicopter carrying the assigned team took off from HMS \"Invincible\" on the night of 17 May, but bad weather forced it to land from its target and the mission was aborted. The pilot flew to Chile, landed south of Punta Arenas, and dropped off the SAS team. The helicopter's crew of three then destroyed the aircraft, surrendered to Chilean police on 25 May, and were repatriated to the UK after interrogation. The discovery of the burnt-out helicopter attracted considerable international attention. Meanwhile, the SAS team crossed the border and penetrated into Argentina, but cancelled their mission after the Argentines suspected an SAS operation and deployed some troops to search for them. The SAS men were able to return to Chile, and took a civilian flight back to the UK.\nOn 14 May the SAS carried out a raid on Pebble Island on the Falklands, where the Argentine Navy had taken over a grass airstrip map for FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1 light ground-attack aircraft and Beechcraft T-34 Mentors, which resulted in the destruction of several aircraft.\nAir and sea battles.\nAt sea, the limitations of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences were demonstrated in the sinking of on 21 May, (on 24 May when attempts to defuse bombs failed), and the loss of the cargo of helicopters, runway-building equipment and tents on (struck by two AM39 Exocets) on 25 May. The loss of all but one of the Chinook helicopters being carried by the Atlantic Conveyor as well as their maintenance equipment and facilities was a severe blow from a logistical perspective.\nAlso lost on 25 May was , a sister to , whilst in company with after being ordered to act as a decoy to draw away Argentine aircraft from other ships at San Carlos Bay. and were moderately damaged. However, many British ships escaped being sunk because of limitations imposed by circumstances on Argentine pilots. To avoid the highest concentration of British air defences, Argentine pilots released bombs at very low altitude, and hence those bomb fuzes did not have sufficient time to arm before impact. The low release of the retarded bombs (some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier) meant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves. The pilots would have been aware of this\u2014but due to the high concentration required to avoid SAMs, Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA), and British Sea Harriers, many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised retarding devices, allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.\nIn his autobiographical account of the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed the BBC World Service for disclosing information that led the Argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a Ministry of Defence official. He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being \"fearless seekers after truth\" than with the lives of British servicemen. Colonel 'H'. Jones levelled similar accusations against the BBC after they disclosed the impending British attack on Goose Green by 2 Para.\nThirteen bombs hit British ships without detonating. Lord Craig, the retired Marshal of the Royal Air Force, is said to have remarked: \"Six better and we would have lost\" although \"Ardent\" and \"Antelope\" were both lost despite the failure of bombs to explode, and \"Argonaut\" was out of action.\nThe fuzes were functioning correctly, and the bombs were simply released from too low an altitude. The Argentines lost 22 aircraft in the attacks.\nOn 30 May, two Super \u00c9tendards, one carrying Argentina's last remaining Exocet, escorted by four A-4C Skyhawks each with two 500lb bombs, took off to attack \"Invincible\". Argentine intelligence had sought to determine the position of the carriers from analysis of aircraft flight routes from the task force to the islands. However, the British had a standing order that all aircraft conduct a low level transit when leaving or returning to the carriers to disguise their position. This tactic compromised the Argentine attack, which focused on a group of escorts 40 miles south of the main body of ships. Two of the attacking Skyhawks were shot down by a Sea Dart fired by HMS \"Exeter\", with HMS \"Avenger\" claiming to have shot down the missile with her 4.5\" gun (although this claim is disputed). No damage was caused to any British vessels. During the war Argentina claimed to have damaged the ship and continues to do so to this day, although no evidence of any such damage has been produced or uncovered.\nLand battles.\nSan Carlos \u2013 Bomb Alley.\nDuring the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare \u2013 COMAW) mounted Operation Sutton, the amphibious landing on beaches around San Carlos Water, on the northwestern coast of East Falkland facing onto Falkland Sound. The bay, known as \"Bomb Alley\" by British forces, was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets.\nThe men of 3 Commando Brigade were put ashore as follows: 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (2 Para) from the RORO ferry \"Norland\" and 40 Commando Royal Marines from the amphibious ship were landed at San Carlos (Blue Beach), 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (3 Para) from the amphibious ship was landed at Port San Carlos (Green Beach) and 45 Commando from RFA \"Stromness\" was landed at Ajax Bay (Red Beach). Notably, the waves of eight LCUs and eight LCVPs were led by Major Ewen Southby-Tailyour, who had commanded the Falklands detachment NP8901 from March 1978 to 1979. 42 Commando on the ocean liner was a tactical reserve. Units from the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, etc. and armoured reconnaissance vehicles were also put ashore with the landing craft, the Round Table class LSL and mexeflote barges. Rapier missile launchers were carried as underslung loads of Sea Kings for rapid deployment.\nBy dawn the next day, they had established a secure beachhead from which to conduct offensive operations. From there, Brigadier Julian Thompson's plan was to capture Darwin and Goose Green before turning towards Port Stanley. Now, with the British troops on the ground, the South Air Force (Argentina) began the night bombing campaign against them using Canberra bomber planes until the last day of the war (14 June).\nGoose Green.\nFrom early on 27 May until 28 May 2 Para (approximately 500 men), with naval gunfire support from and artillery support from 8 Commando Battery, Royal Artillery, approached and attacked Darwin and Goose Green, which was held by the Argentine 12th Infantry Regiment. After a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the next day, the British won the battle; in all, 17 British and 47 Argentine soldiers were killed. A total of 961 Argentine troops (including 202 Argentine Air Force personnel of the \"Condor\" airfield) were taken prisoner.\nThe BBC announced the taking of Goose Green on the BBC World Service before it had actually happened. It was during this attack that Lieutenant Colonel H. Jones, the commanding officer of 2 Para, was killed at the head of his battalion while charging into the well-prepared Argentine positions. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.\nWith the sizeable Argentine force at Goose Green out of the way, British forces were now able to break out of the San Carlos beachhead. On 27 May, men of 45 Cdo and 3 Para started a loaded march across East Falkland towards the coastal settlement of Teal Inlet.\nSpecial forces on Mount Kent.\nMeanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent. Unknown to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with Blowpipe surface-to-air missiles and commandos (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron) to Stanley. This operation was known as \"Autoimpuesta\" (\"Self-determination initiative\").\nFor the next week, the SAS and the Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre (M&amp;AWC) of 3 Commando Brigade waged intense patrol battles with patrols of the volunteers' 602nd Commando Company under Major Aldo Rico, normally second in Command of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Regiment. Throughout 30 May, Royal Air Force Harriers were active over Mount Kent. One of them, Harrier \"XZ963\", flown by Squadron Leader Jerry Pook\u2014in responding to a call for help from D Squadron, attacked Mount Kent's eastern lower slopes, and that led to its loss through small-arms fire. Pook was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\nOn 31 May, the M&amp;AWC defeated Argentine Special Forces at the skirmish at Top Malo House. A 13-strong Argentine Army Commando detachment (Captain Jos\u00e9 Vercesi's 1st Assault Section, 602nd Commando Company) found itself trapped in a small shepherd's house at Top Malo. The Argentine commandos fired from windows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed from the burning house. Completely surrounded, they fought 19 M&amp;AWC marines under Captain Rod Boswell for 45 minutes until, with their ammunition almost exhausted, they elected to surrender.\nThree Cadre members were badly wounded. On the Argentine side, there were two dead, including Lieutenant Ernesto Espinoza and Sergeant Mateo Sbert (who were posthumously decorated for their bravery). Only five Argentines were left unscathed. As the British mopped up Top Malo House, Lieutenant Fraser Haddow's M&amp;AWC patrol came down from Malo Hill, brandishing a large Union Flag. One wounded Argentine soldier, Lieutenant Horacio Losito, commented that their escape route would have taken them through Haddow's position.\n601st Commando tried to move forward to rescue 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain. Spotted by 42 Commando, they were engaged with L16 81mm mortars and forced to withdraw to Two Sisters mountain. The leader of 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain realised his position had become untenable and after conferring with fellow officers ordered a withdrawal.\nThe Argentine operation also saw the extensive use of helicopter support to position and extract patrols; the 601st Combat Aviation Battalion also suffered casualties. At about 11:00\u00a0am on 30 May, an A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma helicopter was brought down by a shoulder-launched FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missile (SAM) fired by the SAS in the vicinity of Mount Kent. Six Argentine National Gendarmerie Special Forces were killed and eight more wounded in the crash.\nAs Brigadier Thompson commented, \"It was fortunate that I had ignored the views expressed by Northwood HQ that reconnaissance of Mount Kent before insertion of 42 Commando was superfluous. Had D Squadron not been there, the Argentine Special Forces would have caught the Commando before de-planing and, in the darkness and confusion on a strange landing zone, inflicted heavy casualties on men and helicopters.\"\nBluff Cove and Fitzroy.\nBy 1 June, with the arrival of a further British troops of the 5th Infantry Brigade, the new British divisional commander, Major General Jeremy Moore RM, had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against Stanley. During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56. Of the dead, 32 were from the Welsh Guards on RFA \"Sir Galahad\" and RFA \"Sir Tristram\" on 8 June. According to Surgeon-Commander Rick Jolly of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including Simon Weston.\nThe Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to Stanley. On 2 June, a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house in a number of Army Westland Scout helicopters. Telephoning ahead to Fitzroy, they discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and (exceeding their authority) commandeered the one remaining RAF Chinook helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy (a settlement on Port Pleasant) and Bluff Cove (a settlement on Port Fitzroy).\nThis uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation, as they now found themselves with of indefensible positions, strung along their southern flank. Support could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already heavily oversubscribed. The soldiers could march, but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea.\nPlans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2 June, whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to be ferried from San Carlos Water in the Landing Ship Logistics (LSL) \"Sir Tristram\" and the landing platform dock (LPD) \"Intrepid\" on the night of 5 June. \"Intrepid\" was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of \"Sir Tristram\" as possible, leaving the next evening for the relative safety of San Carlos. Escorts would be provided for this day, after which \"Sir Tristram\" would be left to unload using a Mexeflote (a powered raft) for as long as it took to finish.\nPolitical pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore Michael Clapp to alter this plan. Two lower-value LSLs would be sent, but with no suitable beaches to land on, \"Intrepid\"s landing craft would need to accompany them to unload. A complicated operation across several nights with \"Intrepid\" and her sister ship sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised.\nThe attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed, possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment. They returned to San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when \"Fearless\" dispatched her landing craft. \"Sir Tristram\" sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by \"Sir Galahad\" at dawn on 7 June. Anchored apart in Port Pleasant, the landing ships were near Fitzroy, the designated landing point.\nThe landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly, but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point (the first half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove) resulted in the senior Welsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy/Bluff Cove. The alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff Cove bridge (destroyed by retreating Argentine combat engineers) to their destination, a journey of around .\nOn \"Sir Galahad\"s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do. The officers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove that day. They were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft. It would take 20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote. They would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait until dark to sail there. The officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail. They refused to take their men off the ship. They possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board \"Sir Galahad\" of the Royal Engineer Troop whose job it was to repair the bridge. The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion, who were potentially facing the enemy without their support. They had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at San Carlos and may have been overconfident in the air defences. Ewen Southby-Tailyour gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach; the order was ignored.\nThe longer journey time of the landing craft taking the troops directly to Bluff Cove and the squabbling over how the landing was to be performed caused an enormous delay in unloading. This had disastrous consequences. Without escorts, having not yet established their air defence, and still almost fully laden, the two LSLs in Port Pleasant were sitting targets for two waves of Argentine A-4 Skyhawks.\nThe disaster at Port Pleasant (although often known as Bluff Cove) would provide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as TV news video footage showed Navy helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships.\nBritish casualties were 48 killed and 115 wounded. Three Argentine pilots were also killed. The air strike delayed the scheduled British ground attack on Stanley by two days. Argentine General Mario Men\u00e9ndez, commander of Argentine forces in the Falklands, was told that 900 British soldiers had died. He expected that the losses would cause enemy morale to drop and the British assault to stall.\nFall of Stanley.\nOn the night of 11 June, after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build-up, British forces launched a brigade-sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley. Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously attacked in the Battle of Mount Harriet, Battle of Two Sisters, and Battle of Mount Longdon. Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers. At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and friendly fire, but managed to capture their objectives. The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon. British forces were bogged down by rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery fire, sniper fire, and ambushes. Despite this, the British continued their advance.\nDuring this battle, 13 were killed when , straying too close to shore while returning from the gun line, was struck by an improvised trailer-based Exocet MM38 launcher taken from the destroyer by Argentine Navy technicians. On the same day, Sergeant Ian McKay of 4 Platoon, B Company, 3 Para died in a grenade attack on an Argentine bunker, which earned him a posthumous Victoria Cross. After a night of fierce fighting, all objectives were secured. Both sides suffered heavy losses.\nThe second phase of attacks began on the night of 13 June, and the momentum of the initial assault was maintained. 2 Para, with light armour support from the Blues and Royals, captured Wireless Ridge, with the loss of 3 British and 25 Argentine lives, and the 2nd battalion, Scots Guards captured Mount Tumbledown at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown, which cost 10 British and 30 Argentine lives.\nWith the last natural defence line at Mount Tumbledown breached, the Argentine town defences of Stanley began to falter. In the morning gloom, one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent. Private Santiago Carrizo of the 3rd Regiment described how a platoon commander ordered them to take up positions in the houses and \"if a Kelper resists, shoot him\", but the entire company did nothing of the kind.\nA ceasefire was declared on 14 June and the commander of the Argentine garrison in Stanley, Brigade General Mario Men\u00e9ndez, surrendered to Major General Jeremy Moore the same day.\nRecapture of South Sandwich Islands.\nOn 20 June, the British retook the South Sandwich Islands, which involved accepting the surrender of the Southern Thule Garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base, and declared hostilities over. Argentina had established Corbeta Uruguay in 1976, but prior to 1982 the United Kingdom had contested the existence of the Argentine base only through diplomatic channels.\nPosition of third-party countries.\nCommonwealth.\nThe UK received political support from member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. Australia, Canada, and New Zealand withdrew their diplomats from Buenos Aires.\nThe New Zealand government expelled the Argentine ambassador following the invasion. The Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, was in London when the war broke out and in an opinion piece published in \"The Times\" he said: \"The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased \u2026 New Zealand will back Britain all the way.\" Broadcasting on the BBC World Service, he told the Falkland Islanders: \"This is Rob Muldoon. We are thinking of you and we are giving our full and total support to the British Government in its endeavours to rectify this situation and get rid of the people who have invaded your country.\u201d On 20 May 1982, he announced that New Zealand would make , a , available for use where the British thought fit to release a Royal Navy vessel for the Falklands. In the House of Commons afterwards, Margaret Thatcher said: \u201c\u2026the New Zealand Government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support for this country [and] the Falkland Islanders, for the rule of liberty and of law\".\nFrance.\nThe French president, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, declared an embargo on French arms sales and assistance to Argentina. In addition, France allowed UK aircraft and warships use of its port and airfield facilities at Dakar in Senegal and France provided dissimilar aircraft training so that Harrier pilots could train against the French aircraft used by Argentina. French intelligence also cooperated with Britain to prevent Argentina from obtaining more Exocet missiles on the international market. In a 2002 interview, and in reference to this support, John Nott, the then British Defence Secretary, had described France as Britain's 'greatest ally'. In 2012, it came to light that while this support was taking place, a French technical team, employed by Dassault and already in Argentina, remained there throughout the war despite the presidential decree. The team had provided material support to the Argentines, identifying and fixing faults in Exocet missile launchers. John Nott said he had known the French team was there but said its work was thought not to be of any importance. An adviser to the then French government denied any knowledge at the time that the technical team was there. The French intelligence department DGSE did know the team was there as they had an informant in the team but decried any assistance the team gave: \"It's bordering on an act of treason, or disobedience to an embargo\". John Nott, when asked if he felt let down by the French said \"If you're asking me: 'Are the French duplicitous people?' the answer is: 'Of course they are, and they always have been.\".\nUnited States.\nDeclassified cables show the U.S. felt that Thatcher had not considered diplomatic options, and also feared that a protracted conflict could draw the Soviet Union on Argentina's side, and initially tried to mediate an end to the conflict through \"shuttle diplomacy\". However, when Argentina refused the U.S. peace overtures, U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced that the United States would prohibit arms sales to Argentina and provide material support for British operations. Both houses of the U.S. Congress passed resolutions supporting the U.S. action siding with the United Kingdom.\nThe U.S. provided the United Kingdom with 200 Sidewinder missiles for use by the Harrier jets, eight Stinger surface to air missile systems, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and mortar bombs. On Ascension Island, the underground fuel tanks were empty when the British Task Force arrived in mid-April 1982 and the leading assault ship, HMS Fearless, did not have enough fuel to dock when it arrived off Ascension. The United States diverted a supertanker to replenish the fuel tanks of ships there at anchor as well as for storage tanks on the island \u2013 approximately 2 million gallons of fuel was supplied. The Pentagon further committed to providing additional support in the event of the war dragging on into the southern hemisphere winter: in this scenario the US committed to providing tanker aircraft to support Royal Air Force missions in Europe, releasing RAF aircraft to support operations over the Falklands.\nThe United States allowed the United Kingdom to use US communication satellites to allow secure communications between submarines in the Southern Ocean and Naval HQ in Britain. The US also passed on satellite imagery (which it publicly denied) and weather forecast data to the British Fleet\nPresident Ronald Reagan approved the Royal Navy's request to borrow a Sea Harrier-capable amphibious Iwo Jima class assault ship (the USS Guam (LPH-9) was earmarked for this)) if the British lost an aircraft carrier. The United States Navy developed a plan to help the British man the ship with American military contractors, likely retired sailors with knowledge of the ship's systems.\nSoviet Union.\nThe Soviet Union described the Falklands as \"a disputed territory,\" recognising Argentina's ambitions over the islands and called for restraint on all sides. They were adamant to veto any resolution in the UN Security Council if tabled by the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union did mount some clandestine logistics operations in favour of the Argentinians. Soviet media frequently criticised the UK and US during the war. Days after the invasion by the Argentinian forces, the Soviets launched additional intelligence satellites into low Earth orbit covering the southern Atlantic Ocean. There are conflicting reports on whether Soviet ocean surveillance data might have played a role in the sinking of HMS Sheffield and . \nCasualties.\nIn total, 907 were killed during the 74 days of the conflict:\nOf the 86 Royal Navy personnel, 22 were lost in , 19 + 1 lost in , 19 + 1 lost in and 13 lost in .\nFourteen naval cooks were among the dead, the largest number from any one branch in the Royal Navy.\nThirty-three of the British Army's dead came from the Welsh Guards (32 of whom died on the RFA \"Sir Galahad\" in the Bluff Cove Air Attacks), 21 from the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, 18 from the 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, 19 from the Special Air Service, 3 from Royal Signals and 8 from each of the Scots Guards and Royal Engineers. The 1st battalion/7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles lost one man.\nThere were Argentine and 777 British injured or wounded.\nRed Cross Box.\nBefore British offensive operations began, the British and Argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side. This area, a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter, was referred to as the Red Cross Box (), about north of Falkland Sound. Ultimately, the British stationed four ships (, and and the primary hospital ship SS \"Uganda\") within the box, while the Argentines stationed three (, and ).\nThe hospital ships were non-warships converted to serve as hospital ships. The three British naval vessels were survey vessels and \"Uganda\" was a passenger liner. \"Almirante Irizar\" was an icebreaker, \"Bahia Paraiso\" was an Antarctic supply transport and \"Puerto Deseado\" was a survey ship. The British and Argentine vessels operating within the Box were in radio contact and there was some transfer of patients between the hospital ships. For example, the \"Uganda\" on four occasions transferred patients to an Argentine hospital ship. \"Hydra\" worked with \"Hecla\" and \"Herald\" to take casualties from \"Uganda\" to Montevideo, Uruguay, where a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances met them. RAF VC10 aircraft then flew the casualties to the UK for transfer to the Princess Alexandra Hospital at RAF Wroughton, near Swindon.\nThroughout the conflict officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the Geneva Conventions. Argentine naval officers also inspected the British casualty ferries in the estuary of the River Plate.\nAftermath.\nThis brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved, besides the considerable casualty rate and large materiel loss, especially of shipping and aircraft, relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides.\nIn the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher's popularity increased. The success of the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the Conservative government, who had been trailing behind the SDP-Liberal Alliance in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began, but after the success in the Falklands the Conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win the following year's general election by a landslide. Subsequently, Defence Secretary Nott's proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned.\nThe islanders subsequently had full British citizenship restored in 1983, their lifestyle was improved by investments the UK made after the war and by the liberalisation of economic measures that had been stalled through fear of angering Argentina. In 1985, a new constitution was enacted promoting self-government, which has continued to devolve power to the islanders.\nIn Argentina, defeat in the Falklands War meant that a possible war with Chile was avoided. Further, Argentina returned to a democratic government in the 1983 general election, the first free general election since 1973. It also had a major social impact, destroying the military's image as the \"moral reserve of the nation\" that they had maintained through most of the 20th century.\nVarious figures have been produced for the number of veterans who have committed suicide since the war. Some studies have estimated that 264 British veterans and 350\u2013500 Argentine veterans have committed suicide since 1982. However, a detailed study of British veterans of the war commissioned by the UK Ministry of Defence found that between 1982 and 2012 only 95 had died from \"intentional self-harm and events of undetermined intent (suicides and open verdict deaths)\", a proportion lower than would be expected within the general population over the same period.\nMilitary analysis.\nMilitarily, the Falklands conflict remains one of the largest air-naval combat operations between modern forces since the end of the Second World War. As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians. The most significant \"lessons learned\" include: the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power, and reconfirmation of the role of tactical air power, including the use of helicopters.\nIn 1986, the BBC broadcast the \"Horizon\" programme, \"In the Wake of HMS Sheffield\", which discussed lessons learned from the conflict, and measures since taken to implement them, such as incorporating greater stealth capabilities and providing better close-in weapon systems for the Fleet. The principal British military responses to the Falklands War were the measures adopted in the December 1982 Defence White Paper.\nMemorials.\nThere are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the 1982 Liberation Memorial, unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war. It lists the names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the Secretariat Building in Stanley, overlooking Stanley Harbour. The Memorial was funded entirely by the Islanders and is inscribed with the words \"In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us\".\nIn addition to memorials on the islands, there is a memorial in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, London to the British war dead. The Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel at Pangbourne College was opened in March 2000 as a commemoration of the lives and sacrifice of all those who served and died in the South Atlantic in 1982. In Argentina, there is a memorial at Plaza San Mart\u00edn in Buenos Aires, in Rosario, and in Ushuaia.\nDuring the war, British dead were put into plastic body bags and buried in mass graves. After the war, the bodies were recovered; 14 were reburied at Blue Beach Military Cemetery and 64 were returned to the UK.\nMany of the Argentine dead are buried in the Argentine Military Cemetery west of the Darwin Settlement. The government of Argentina declined an offer by the UK to have the bodies repatriated to Argentina.\nMinefields.\nIn 2011 there were 113 uncleared minefields plus unexploded ordnance (UXOs) covering an area of on the Falkland Islands. Of this area, on the Murrell Peninsula were classified as being \"suspected minefields\"\u2014the area had been heavily pastured for 25 years without incident. It was estimated that these minefields had anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines.\nThe UK reported six military personnel injured by mines or UXO in 1982, then two more in 1983. Most military accidents took place in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, while clearing minefields or trying to establish the extent of minefield perimeters, particularly where no detailed records existed. No civilian mine casualties have ever occurred on the islands, and no human casualties from mines or UXO have been reported since 1984.\nOn 9 May 2008, the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields, which represent 0.1% of the available farmland on the islands \"present no long term social or economic difficulties for the Falklands,\" and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them. However, the British Government, in accordance with its commitments under the Mine Ban Treaty had a commitment to clear the mines by the end of 2019.\nIn May 2012, it was announced that of Stanley Common (which lies between the Stanley \u2013 Mount Pleasant road and the shoreline) was made safe and had been opened to the public, opening up a stretch of coastline and a further two kilometres of shoreline along Mullet's Creek.\nIn November 2020, it was declared that the Falkland islands were now free of all landmines. A celebration of the event took place on the weekend of 14 November where the final landmine was detonated.\nPress and publicity.\nArgentina.\nSelected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war. Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines reported on \"the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes\".\nOfficers from the intelligence services were attached to the newspapers and 'leaked' information confirming the official communiqu\u00e9s from the government. The glossy magazines \"Gente\" and \"Siete D\u00edas\" swelled to 60 pages with colour photographs of British warships in flames\u2014many of them faked\u2014and bogus eyewitness reports of the Argentine commandos' guerrilla war on South Georgia (6 May) and an already dead Pucar\u00e1 pilot's attack on HMS \"Hermes\" (Lt. Daniel Antonio Jukic had been killed at Goose Green during a British air strike on 1 May). Most of the faked photos actually came from the tabloid press. One of the best remembered headlines was \"Estamos ganando\" (\"We're winning\") from the magazine \"Gente\", that would later use variations of it.\nThe Argentine troops on the Falkland Islands could read \"Gaceta Argentina\"\u2014a newspaper intended to boost morale among the servicemen. Some of its untruths could easily be unveiled by the soldiers who recovered corpses.\nThe \"Malvinas cause\" united the Argentines in a patriotic atmosphere that protected the junta from critics, and even opponents of the military government supported Galtieri; Ernesto Sabato said: \"In Argentina, it is not a military dictatorship that is fighting. It is the whole people, her women, her children, her old people, regardless of their political persuasion. Opponents to the regime like myself are fighting for our dignity, fighting to extricate the last vestiges of colonialism. Don't be mistaken, Europe, it is not a dictatorship that is fighting for the Malvinas; it is the whole nation\".\nIn the Argentine press, false reports that the HMS \"Hermes\" was sunk and HMS \"Invincible\" had been damaged were circulated after the weekly magazines \"Gente\" and \"La Semana\" had received information of naval action from an air force officer in the president's office. On 30 April 1982 the Argentine magazine \"Tal Cual\" showed Prime Minister Thatcher with an eyepatch and the text: \"Pirate, witch and assassin. Guilty!\" Three British reporters sent to Argentina to cover the war from the Argentine perspective were jailed until the end of the war. The \"Madres de Plaza de Mayo\" were even exposed to death threats from ordinary people.\nUnited Kingdom.\nSeventeen newspaper reporters, two photographers, two radio reporters and three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to the war. The Newspaper Publishers' Association selected them from among 160 applicants, excluding foreign media.\nThe hasty selection resulted in the inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in Queen Elizabeth II's son Prince Andrew, who was serving in the conflict. The Prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions, including Anti-Surface Warfare, Exocet missile decoy and casualty evacuation.\nMerchant vessels had the civilian Inmarsat uplink, which enabled written telex and voice report transmissions via satellite. had a facsimile machine that was used to upload 202 pictures from the South Atlantic over the course of the war. The Royal Navy leased bandwidth on the U.S. Defense Satellite Communications System for worldwide communications. Television demands a thousand times the data rate of telephone, but the Ministry of Defence was unsuccessful in convincing the U.S. to allocate more bandwidth.\nTV producers suspected that the enquiry was half-hearted; since the Vietnam War television pictures of casualties and traumatised soldiers were recognised as having negative propaganda value. However, the technology only allowed uploading a single frame per 20 minutes\u2014and only if the military satellites were allocated 100% to television transmissions. Videotapes were shipped to Ascension Island, where a broadband satellite uplink was available, resulting in TV coverage being delayed by three weeks.\nThe press was very dependent on the Royal Navy, and was censored on site. Many reporters in the UK knew more about the war than those with the Task Force. Ministry of Defence press briefings in London were characterised by the restrained dictation-speed delivery of its spokesman, Ian McDonald.\nThe Royal Navy expected Fleet Street to conduct a Second World War-style positive news campaign but the majority of the British media, especially the BBC, reported the war in a neutral fashion. These reporters referred to \"the British troops\" and \"the Argentinian troops\" instead of \"our lads\" and the \"Argies\". The two main tabloid papers presented opposing viewpoints: \"The Daily Mirror\" was decidedly anti-war, whilst \"The Sun\" became well known for headlines such as \"Stick It Up Your Junta!,\" which, along with the reporting in other tabloids, led to accusations of xenophobia and jingoism. \"The Sun\" was criticised for its \"Gotcha\" headline following the sinking of the .\nCultural impact.\nThere were wide-ranging influences on popular culture in both the UK and Argentina, from the immediate postwar period to the present. The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges described the war as \"a fight between two bald men over a comb\". The words \"yomp\" and \"Exocet\" entered the British vernacular as a result of the war. The Falklands War also provided material for theatre, film and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians. In Argentina, the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the English language, giving way to the rise of local rock musicians."}
{"id": "11524", "revid": "6441698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11524", "title": "Fahrenheit", "text": "The Fahrenheit scale ( or ) is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686\u20131736). It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: \u00b0F) as the unit. Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist, but the original paper suggests the lower defining point, 0\u00a0\u00b0F, was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride (a salt). The other limit established was his best estimate of the average human body temperature, originally set at 90\u00a0\u00b0F, then 96\u00b0F (about 2.6\u00a0\u00b0F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale ). However, he noted a middle point of 32\u00a0\u00b0F, to be set to the temperature of ice water.\nThe Fahrenheit scale is now usually defined by two fixed points: the temperature at which pure water freezes into ice is defined as 32\u00a0\u00b0F and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212\u00a0\u00b0F, both at sea level and under standard atmospheric pressure (a 180\u00a0\u00b0F separation).\nIn the first decades of the 18th century in the Dutch Republic, Daniel Fahrenheit made two revolutionary breakthroughs in the history of thermometry. He invented the mercury-in-glass thermometer (first widely used, accurate, practical thermometer) and Fahrenheit scale. Fahrenheit has been the first standardized temperature scale to be widely used, although its use is now limited. It is the official temperature scale in the United States (including its unincorporated territories), its freely associated states in the Western Pacific (Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands), the Cayman Islands, and Liberia. Fahrenheit is used alongside the Celsius scale in Antigua and Barbuda and other countries which use the same meteorological service, such as Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas, and Belize. A handful of British Overseas Territories still use both scales, including the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Anguilla, and Bermuda. In newspapers in the United Kingdom, degrees Fahrenheit figures are sometimes used in headlines for the sensationalism of heatwaves. All other countries in the world now officially use the \"Celsius scale\", the name given to the \"centigrade scale\" in 1948 in honor of Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius.\nDefinition and conversion.\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is 32\u00b0F and the boiling point is 212\u00b0F (at standard atmospheric pressure). This puts the boiling and freezing points of water 180\u00a0degrees apart. Therefore, a degree on the Fahrenheit scale is of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point. On the Celsius scale, the freezing and boiling points of water are 100\u00a0degrees apart. A temperature interval of 1\u00a0\u00b0F is equal to an interval of \u00a0degrees Celsius. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales intersect at \u221240\u00b0 (i.e., \u221240\u00a0\u00b0F = \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C).\nAbsolute zero is \u2212273.15\u00a0\u00b0C or \u2212459.67\u00a0\u00b0F. The Rankine temperature scale uses degree intervals of the same size as those of the Fahrenheit scale, except that absolute zero is 0\u00a0\u00b0R \u2014 the same way that the Kelvin temperature scale matches the Celsius scale, except that absolute zero is 0\u00a0K.\nThe combination of degree symbol \u00b0 followed by an uppercase letter F is the conventional symbol for the Fahrenheit temperature scale. A number followed by this symbol (and separated from it with a space) denotes a specific temperature point (\"e.g.\" \"Gallium melts at 85.5763\u00a0\u00b0F\"), a difference between temperatures (\"e.g.\" \"The output of the heat exchanger experiences an increase of 72\u00a0\u00b0F\") or an uncertainty in temperature (\"e.g.\" \"Our standard uncertainty is \u00b15\u00a0\u00b0F\"). The symbol for the Celsius scale also uses the degree symbol but with an uppercase letter C (\"\u00b0C\"), while the symbol for the Kelvin scale is just an uppercase letter K (\"K\"). The numerical value of a temperature difference or temperature interval is the same when expressed in either degrees Celsius or in kelvin.\nConversion (specific temperature point).\nFor an exact conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius of \"a specific temperature point\", the following formulas can be applied. Here, is the value in Fahrenheit and the value in Celsius:\nThere is also an exact conversion making use of the equality \u221240\u00a0\u00b0F = \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C. Again, is the value in Fahrenheit and the value in Celsius:\nConversion (temperature difference or interval).\nWhen converting a \"temperature interval\" between \u00b0F and\u00a0\u00b0C, only the ratio is used, without any constant (in this case, the interval has the same numeric value in Kelvin as in degrees Celsius):\nHistory.\nFahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724, basing it on two reference points of temperature. In his initial scale (which is not the final Fahrenheit scale), the zero point was determined by placing the thermometer in \"a mixture of ice, water, and \"salis Armoniaci\" [transl. ammonium chloride] or even sea salt\". This combination forms a eutectic system which stabilizes its temperature automatically: 0\u00a0\u00b0F was defined to be that stable temperature. A second point, 96\u00a0degrees, was approximately the human body's temperature (\"sanguine hominis sani\", the blood of a healthy person). A third point, 32 degrees, was marked as being the temperature of ice and water \"without the aforementioned salts\".\nAccording to a German story, Fahrenheit actually chose the lowest air temperature measured in his hometown Danzig (Gda\u0144sk, Poland) in winter 1708/09 as 0\u00a0\u00b0F, and only later had the need to be able to make this value reproducible using brine.\nAccording to a letter Fahrenheit wrote to his friend Herman Boerhaave, his scale was built on the work of Ole R\u00f8mer, whom he had met earlier. In R\u00f8mer's scale, brine freezes at zero, water freezes and melts at 7.5\u00a0degrees, body temperature is 22.5, and water boils at 60\u00a0degrees. Fahrenheit multiplied each value by four in order to eliminate fractions and make the scale more fine-grained. He then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature (which were at 30 and 90 degrees); he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees and body temperature 96 degrees, so that 64 intervals would separate the two, allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six times (since 64 is 2 to the sixth power).\nFahrenheit soon after observed that water boils at about 212 degrees using this scale. The use of the freezing and boiling points of water as thermometer fixed reference points became popular following the work of Anders Celsius and these fixed points were adopted by a committee of the Royal Society led by Henry Cavendish in 1776. Under this system, the Fahrenheit scale is redefined slightly so that the freezing point of water is exactly 32\u00a0\u00b0F, and the boiling point is exactly 212\u00a0\u00b0F or 180 degrees higher. It is for this reason that normal human body temperature is approximately 98.6\u00b0 (oral temperature) on the revised scale (whereas it was 90\u00b0 on Fahrenheit's multiplication of R\u00f8mer, and 96\u00b0 on his original scale).\nIn the present-day Fahrenheit scale, 0\u00a0\u00b0F no longer corresponds to the eutectic temperature of ammonium chloride brine as described above. Instead, that eutectic is at approximately 4\u00a0\u00b0F on the final Fahrenheit scale.\nThe Rankine temperature scale was based upon the Fahrenheit temperature scale, with its zero representing absolute zero instead.\nUsage.\nThe Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English-speaking countries until the 1960s. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the Celsius scale replaced Fahrenheit in almost all of those countries\u2014with the notable exception of the United States and in certain cases, the United Kingdom\u2014typically during their general metrication process.\nFahrenheit is used in the United States, its territories and associated states (all served by the U.S. National Weather Service), as well as the Cayman Islands and Liberia for everyday applications. For example, U.S. weather forecasts, food cooking, and freezing temperatures are typically given in degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists, such as meteorologists, use degrees Celsius or kelvin in all countries.\nEarly in the 20th century, Halsey and Dale suggested that reasons for resistance to use the centigrade (now Celsius) system in the U.S. included the larger size of each degree Celsius and the lower zero point in the Fahrenheit system.\nCanada has passed legislation favoring the International System of Units, while also maintaining legal definitions for traditional Canadian imperial units. Canadian weather reports are conveyed using degrees Celsius with occasional reference to Fahrenheit especially for cross-border broadcasts. Fahrenheit is still used on virtually all Canadian ovens. Thermometers, both digital and analog, sold in Canada usually employ both the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.\nIn the European Union, it is mandatory to use kelvins or degrees Celsius when quoting temperature for \"economic, public health, public safety and administrative\" purposes, though degrees Fahrenheit may be used alongside degrees Celsius as a supplementary unit. For example, the laundry symbols used in the United Kingdom follow the recommendations of ISO 3758:2005 showing the temperature of the washing machine water in degrees Celsius only. The equivalent label in North America uses one to six dots to denote temperature with an optional temperature in degrees Celsius.\nFahrenheit is still commonly used in the United Kingdom in common conversation, but less so with young people and many people use both depending on the context. Within unregulated sectors, such as journalism, the use of Fahrenheit in the United Kingdom follows no fixed pattern with degrees Fahrenheit often appearing alongside degrees Celsius. \"The Daily Telegraph\" does not mention Fahrenheit on its daily weather page while \"The Times\" also has an all-metric daily weather page but has a Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion table. When publishing news stories, much of the UK press have adopted a tendency of using degrees Celsius in headlines and discussion relating to low temperatures and Fahrenheit for mid to high temperatures. In February 2006, the writer of an article in \"The Times\" suggested that the rationale was one of emphasis: \"\u22126\u00a0\u00b0C\" sounds colder than \"21\u00a0\u00b0F\" and \"94\u00a0\u00b0F\" sounds more impressive than \"34\u00a0\u00b0C\".\nUnicode representation of symbol.\nUnicode provides the Fahrenheit symbol at code point . However, this is a compatibility character encoded for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings. The Unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character: \"The sequence + is preferred over , and those two sequences should be treated as identical for searching.\""}

It is the most populated city in Tuscany, with 383,084 inhabitants in 2013, and over 1,520,000 in its metropolitan area.\nFlorence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era. It is considered by many academics to have been the birthplace of the Renaissance, and has been called \"the Athens of the Middle Ages\". Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions. From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy (established in 1861). The Florentine dialect forms the base of Standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini.\nThe city attracts millions of tourists each year, and UNESCO declared the Historic Centre of Florence a World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is noted for its culture, Renaissance art and architecture and monuments. The city also contains numerous museums and art galleries, such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Palazzo Pitti, and still exerts an influence in the fields of art, culture and politics. Due to Florence's artistic and architectural heritage, \"Forbes\" has ranked it as one of the most beautiful cities in the world.\nFlorence plays an important role in Italian fashion, and is ranked in the top 15 fashion capitals of the world by Global Language Monitor; furthermore, it is a major national economic centre, as well as a tourist and industrial hub. In 2008 the city had the 17th-highest average income in Italy.\nHistory.\nFlorence originated as a Roman city, and later, after a long period as a flourishing trading and banking medieval commune, it was the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance. It was politically, economically, and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries.\nThe language spoken in the city during the 14th century came to be accepted as the model for what would become the Italian language. Thanks especially to the works of the Tuscans Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, Florentine dialect, above all the local dialects, was adopted as the basis for a national literary language.\nStarting from the late Middle Ages, Florentine money\u2014in the form of the gold florin\u2014financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges, to Lyon and Hungary. Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the Hundred Years War. They similarly financed the papacy, including the construction of their provisional capital of Avignon and, after their return to Rome, the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome.\nFlorence was home to the Medici, one of European history's most important noble families. Lorenzo de' Medici was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century. Two members of the family were popes in the early 16th century: Leo X and Clement VII. Catherine de Medici married King Henry II of France and, after his death in 1559, reigned as regent in France. Marie de' Medici married Henry IV of France and gave birth to the future King Louis XIII. The Medici reigned as Grand Dukes of Tuscany, starting with Cosimo I de' Medici in 1569 and ending with the death of Gian Gastone de' Medici in 1737.\nRoman origins.\nIn the 9th\u20138th century\u00a0BC, the Etruscans formed the small settlement of Fiesole (Faesulae in Latin) This was destroyed by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 80\u00a0BC, in reprisal for supporting the populares faction in Rome. The present city of Florence was established by Julius Caesar in 59\u00a0BC as a settlement for his veteran soldiers and was named originally \"Fluentia\", owing to the fact that it was built between two rivers, which was later changed to \"Florentia\" (\"flowering\"). It was built in the style of an army camp with the main streets, the \"cardo\" and the \"decumanus\", intersecting at the present \"Piazza della Repubblica\". Situated along the \"Via Cassia\", the main route between Rome and the north, and within the fertile valley of the Arno, the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre.\nIn centuries to come, the city experienced turbulent periods of Ostrogothic rule, during which the city was often troubled by warfare between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines, which may have caused the population to fall to as few as 1,000 people. Peace returned under Lombard rule in the 6th century. Florence was conquered by Charlemagne in 774 and became part of the Duchy of Tuscany, with Lucca as capital. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered. In 854, Florence and Fiesole were united in one county.\nSecond millennium.\nMargrave Hugo chose Florence as his residency instead of Lucca at about 1000\u00a0AD. The Golden Age of Florentine art began around this time. In 1013, construction began on the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte. The exterior of the church was reworked in Romanesque style between 1059 and 1128. In 1100, Florence was a \"Commune\", meaning a city state. The city's primary resource was the Arno river, providing power and access for the industry (mainly textile industry), and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade. Another great source of strength was its industrious merchant community. The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation (e.g. bills of exchange, double-entry bookkeeping system) to medieval fairs. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival Pisa (defeated by Genoa in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406), and the exercise of power by the mercantile elite following an anti-aristocratic movement, led by Giano della Bella, that resulted in a set of laws called the Ordinances of Justice (1293).\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.\nRise of the Medici.\nAt the height of demographic expansion around 1325, the urban population may have been as great as 120,000, and the rural population around the city was probably close to 300,000. The Black Death of 1348 reduced it by over half, about 25,000 are said to have been supported by the city's wool industry: in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers (\"ciompi\"), who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule in the Revolt of the Ciompi. After their suppression, Florence came under the sway (1382\u20131434) of the Albizzi family, who became bitter rivals of the Medici.\nIn the 15th century, Florence was among the largest cities in Europe, with a population of 60,000, and was considered rich and economically successful. Cosimo de' Medici was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast patronage network along with his alliance to the new immigrants, the \"gente nuova\" (new people). The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy. Cosimo was succeeded by his son Piero, who was, soon after, succeeded by Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo in 1469. Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts, commissioning works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli. Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence, including Alexander Agricola, Johannes Ghiselin, and Heinrich Isaac. By contemporary Florentines (and since), he was known as \"Lorenzo the Magnificent\" (Lorenzo il Magnifico).\nFollowing Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1492, he was succeeded by his son Piero\u00a0II. When the French king Charles\u00a0VIII invaded northern Italy, Piero\u00a0II chose to resist his army. But when he realised the size of the French army at the gates of Pisa, he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king. These made the Florentines rebel, and they expelled Piero\u00a0II. With his exile in 1494, the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government.\nSavonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medici Popes.\nDuring this period, the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola had become prior of the San Marco monastery in 1490. He was famed for his penitential sermons, lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches. He praised the exile of the Medici as the work of God, punishing them for their decadence. He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule. But when Savonarola publicly accused Pope Alexander VI of corruption, he was banned from speaking in public. When he broke this ban, he was excommunicated. The Florentines, tired of his extreme teachings, turned against him and arrested him. He was convicted as a heretic and burned at the stake on the Piazza della Signoria on 23 May 1498.\nA second individual of unusually acute insight was Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimisation of political expediency and even malpractice. In other words, Machiavelli was a political thinker, perhaps most renowned for his political handbook, titled The Prince, which is about ruling and the exercise of power. Commissioned by the Medici, Machiavelli also wrote the Florentine Histories, the history of the city. Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a republic on 16 May 1527. Restored twice with the support of both Emperor Charles V and Pope Clement VII (Giulio de Medici), the Medici in 1532 became hereditary dukes of Florence, and in 1569 Grand Dukes of Tuscany, ruling for two centuries. In all Tuscany, only the Republic of Lucca (later a Duchy) and the Principality of Piombino were independent from Florence.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nThe extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of Francis Stephen, duke of Lorraine and husband of Maria Theresa of Austria, led to Tuscany's temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. It became a secundogeniture of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, who were deposed for the House of Bourbon-Parma in 1801. From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the Napoleonic client state Kingdom of Etruria. The Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by France. Florence was the prefecture of the French d\u00e9partement of Arno from 1808 to the fall of Napoleon in 1814. The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the Congress of Vienna but finally deposed in 1859. Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\nFlorence replaced Turin as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza Vittorio Emanuele\u00a0II, then Piazza della Repubblica, the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city. A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today.\nThe country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later, after the withdrawal of the French troops allowed the capture of Rome.\n20th century.\nDuring World War II the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943\u20131944) being part of the Italian Social Republic. Hitler declared it an open city on 3 July 1944 as troops of the British 8th Army closed in. In early August, the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the Arno linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city, making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross. However, at the last moment Charles Steinhauslin, at the time consul of 26 countries in Florence, convinced the German general in Italy that the Ponte Vecchio was not to be destroyed due to its historical value. Instead, an equally historic area of streets directly to the south of the bridge, including part of the Corridoio Vasariano, was destroyed using mines. Since then the bridges have been restored to their original forms using as many of the remaining materials as possible, but the buildings surrounding the Ponte Vecchio have been rebuilt in a style combining the old with modern design. Shortly before leaving Florence, as they knew that they would soon have to retreat, the Germans executed many freedom fighters and political opponents publicly, in streets and squares including the Piazza Santo Spirito.\nFlorence was liberated by New Zealand, South African and British troops on 4 August 1944 alongside partisans from the Tuscan Committee of National Liberation (CTLN). The Allied soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city (Americans about south of the city, British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno).\nAt the end of World War II in May 1945, the US Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence, Italy. The first American University for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics in Florence, Italy. Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the University during its four one-month sessions (see G. I. American Universities).\nIn November 1966, the Arno flooded parts of the centre, damaging many art treasures. Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point.\nGeography.\nFlorence lies in a basin formed by the hills of Careggi, Fiesole, Settignano, Arcetri, Poggio Imperiale and Bellosguardo (Florence). The Arno river, three other minor rivers (Mugnone, Ema and Greve) and some streams flow through it.\nClimate.\nFlorence has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\"), tending to Mediterranean (\"Csa\"). It has hot summers with moderate or light rainfall and cool, damp winters. As Florence lacks a prevailing wind, summer temperatures are higher than along the coast. Rainfall in summer is convectional, while relief rainfall dominates in the winter. Snow flurries occur almost every year, but often result in no accumulation. The highest officially recorded temperature was on 26 July 1983 and the lowest was on 12 January 1985.\nGovernment.\nThe legislative body of the municipality is the City Council (\"Consiglio Comunale\"), which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, at the same time as the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (\"Giunta Comunale\"), composed of 7 assessors, nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor. The current mayor of Florence is Dario Nardella.\nThe municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs (\"Quartieri\"). Each borough is governed by a Council (\"Consiglio\") and a President, elected at the same time as the city mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding in order to finance local activities. The boroughs are:\nAll of the five boroughs are governed by the Democratic Party.\nThe former Italian Prime Minister (2014\u20132016), Matteo Renzi, served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.\nMain sights.\nFlorence is known as the \"cradle of the Renaissance\" (\"la culla del Rinascimento\") for its monuments, churches, and buildings. The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city, Santa Maria del Fiore, known as \"The Duomo\", whose dome was built by Filippo Brunelleschi. The nearby Campanile (partly designed by Giotto) and the Baptistery buildings are also highlights. The dome, 600 years after its completion, is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world. In 1982, the historic centre of Florence (Italian: \"centro storico di Firenze\") was declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. The centre of the city is contained in medieval walls that were built in the 14th century to defend the city. At the heart of the city, in Piazza della Signoria, is Bartolomeo Ammannati's Fountain of Neptune (1563\u20131565), which is a masterpiece of marble sculpture at the terminus of a still functioning Roman aqueduct.\nThe layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era, where it was designed as a garrison settlement. Nevertheless, the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance. Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city, traces of medieval, Baroque, Neoclassical and modern architecture can be found. The Palazzo Vecchio as well as the Duomo, or the city's Cathedral, are the two buildings which dominate Florence's skyline.\nThe river Arno, which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno \u2013 which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.\nOne of the bridges in particular stands out \u2013 the Ponte Vecchio (\"Old Bridge\"), whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges, held up by stilts. The bridge also carries Vasari's elevated corridor linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence (Palazzo Pitti). Although the original bridge was constructed by the Etruscans, the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century. It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War\u00a0II intact. It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental arches, that is, arches less than a semicircle, to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed (being in this much more successful than the Roman Alcon\u00e9tar Bridge).\nThe church of San Lorenzo contains the Medici Chapel, the mausoleum of the Medici family\u2014the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th century. Nearby is the Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest art museums in the world \u2013 founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family.\nThe Uffizi is located at the corner of Piazza della Signoria, a site important for being the centre of Florence's civil life and government for centuries. The Palazzo della Signoria facing it is still home of the municipal government. Many significant episodes in the history of art and political changes were staged here, such as:\nThe Loggia dei Lanzi in Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as Donatello, Giambologna, Ammannati and Cellini, although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals.\nMonuments, museums and religious buildings.\nFlorence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras. The Palazzo Vecchio is the town hall of Florence and also an art museum. This large Romanesque crenellated fortress-palace overlooks the Piazza della Signoria with its copy of Michelangelo's David statue as well as the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi. Originally called the \"Palazzo della Signoria\", after the Signoria of Florence, the ruling body of the Republic of Florence, it was also given several other names: \"Palazzo del Popolo\", \"Palazzo dei Priori\", and \"Palazzo Ducale\", in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the Corridoio Vasariano.\nPalazzo Medici Riccardi, designed by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo for Cosimo il Vecchio, of the Medici family, is another major edifice, and was built between 1445 and 1460. It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar. Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence and hosts museums and the Riccardiana Library. The Palazzo Strozzi, an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, was inspired by the Palazzo Medici, but with more harmonious proportions. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show (founded as the Biennale dell'Antiquariato in 1959), fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events. Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted Gabinetto Vieusseux, with the library and reading room.\nThere are several other notable places, including the Palazzo Rucellai, designed by Leon Battista Alberti between 1446 and 1451 and executed, at least in part, by Bernardo Rossellino; the Palazzo Davanzati, which houses the museum of the Old Florentine House; the Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali, designed in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1871; the Palazzo Spini Feroni, in Piazza Santa Trinita, a historic 13th-century private palace, owned since the 1920s by shoe-designer Salvatore Ferragamo; as well as various others, including the Palazzo Borghese, the Palazzo di Bianca Cappello, the Palazzo Antinori, and the Royal building of Santa Maria Novella.\nFlorence contains numerous museums and art galleries where some of the world's most important works of art are held. The city is one of the best preserved Renaissance centres of art and architecture in the world and has a high concentration of art, architecture and culture. In the ranking list of the 15 most visited Italian art museums, \u2154 are represented by Florentine museums. The Uffizi is one of these, having a very large collection of international and Florentine art. The gallery is articulated in many halls, catalogued by schools and chronological order. Engendered by the Medici family's artistic collections through the centuries, it houses works of art by various painters and artists. The Vasari Corridor is another gallery, built connecting the Palazzo Vecchio with the Pitti Palace passing by the Uffizi and over the Ponte Vecchio. The Galleria dell'Accademia houses a Michelangelo collection, including the David. It has a collection of Russian icons and works by various artists and painters. Other museums and galleries include the Bargello, which concentrates on sculpture works by artists including Donatello, Giambologna and Michelangelo; the Palazzo Pitti, containing part of the Medici family's former private collection. In addition to the Medici collection, the palace's galleries contain many Renaissance works, including several by Raphael and Titian, large collections of costumes, ceremonial carriages, silver, porcelain and a gallery of modern art dating from the 18th century. Adjoining the palace are the Boboli Gardens, elaborately landscaped and with numerous sculptures.\nThere are several different churches and religious buildings in Florence. The cathedral is Santa Maria del Fiore. The San Giovanni Baptistery located in front of the cathedral, is decorated by numerous artists, notably by Lorenzo Ghiberti with the \"Gates of Paradise\". Other churches in Florence include the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, located in Santa Maria Novella square (near the Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station) which contains works by Masaccio, Paolo Uccello, Filippino Lippi and Domenico Ghirlandaio; the Basilica of Santa Croce, the principal Franciscan church in the city, which is situated on the Piazza di Santa Croce, about south east of the Duomo, and is the burial place of some of the most illustrious Italians, such as Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelli, Foscolo, Rossini, thus it is known also as the Temple of the Italian Glories (Tempio dell'Itale Glorie); the Basilica of San Lorenzo, which is one of the largest churches in the city, situated at the centre of Florence's main market district, and the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family from Cosimo il Vecchio to Cosimo III; Santo Spirito, in the Oltrarno quarter, facing the square with the same name; Orsanmichele, whose building was constructed on the site of the kitchen garden of the monastery of San Michele, now demolished; Santissima Annunziata, a Roman Catholic basilica and the mother church of the Servite order; Ognissanti, which was founded by the lay order of the Umiliati, and is among the first examples of Baroque architecture built in the city; the Santa Maria del Carmine, in the Oltrarno district of Florence, which is the location of the Brancacci Chapel, housing outstanding Renaissance frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale, later finished by Filippino Lippi; the Medici Chapel with statues by Michelangelo, in the San Lorenzo; as well as several others, including Santa Trinita, San Marco, Santa Felicita, Badia Fiorentina, San Gaetano, San Miniato al Monte, Florence Charterhouse, and Santa Maria del Carmine. The city additionally contains the Orthodox Russian church of Nativity, and the Great Synagogue of Florence, built in the 19th century.\nFlorence contains various theatres and cinemas. The Odeon Cinema of the Palazzo dello Strozzino is one of the oldest cinemas in the city. Established from 1920 to 1922 in a wing of the Palazzo dello Strozzino, it used to be called the \"Cinema Teatro Savoia\" (Savoy Cinema-Theatre), yet was later called \"Odeon\". The Teatro della Pergola, located in the centre of the city on the eponymous street, is an opera house built in the 17th century. Another theatre is the Teatro Comunale (or \"Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino\"), originally built as the open-air amphitheatre, the \"Politeama Fiorentino Vittorio Emanuele\", which was inaugurated on 17 May 1862 with a production of Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" and which seated 6,000 people. There are several other theatres, such as the Saloncino Castinelli, the Teatro Puccini, the Teatro Verdi, the Teatro Goldoni and the Teatro Niccolini.\nCathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore.\nFlorence Cathedral, formally the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, is the cathedral of Florence, Italy. It was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was structurally completed by 1436, with the dome designed by Filippo Brunelleschi.\nSquares, streets and parks.\nAside from such monuments, Florence contains numerous major squares (\"piazze\") and streets. The Piazza della Repubblica is a square in the city centre, location of the cultural caf\u00e9s and bourgeois palaces. Among the square's caf\u00e9s (like Caff\u00e8 Gilli, Paszkowski or the Hard Rock Caf\u00e8), the Giubbe Rosse caf\u00e9 has long been a meeting place for artists and writers, notably those of Futurism. The Piazza Santa Croce is another; dominated by the Basilica of Santa Croce, it is a rectangular square in the centre of the city where the Calcio Fiorentino is played every year. Furthermore, there is the Piazza Santa Trinita, a square near the Arno that mark the end of the Via de' Tornabuoni street.\nOther squares include the Piazza San Marco, the Piazza Santa Maria Novella, the Piazza Beccaria and the Piazza della Libert\u00e0. The centre additionally contains several streets. Such include the Via Camillo Cavour, one of the main roads of the northern area of the historic centre; the Via Ghibellina, one of central Florence's longest streets; the Via dei Calzaiuoli, one of the most central streets of the historic centre which links \"Piazza del Duomo\" to Piazza della Signoria, winding parallel to via Roma and \"Piazza della Repubblica\"; the Via de' Tornabuoni, a luxurious street in the city centre that goes from Antinori square to ponte Santa Trinita, across Piazza Santa Trinita, characterised by the presence of fashion boutiques; the Viali di Circonvallazione, 6-lane boulevards surrounding the northern part of the historic centre; as well as others, such as Via Roma, Via degli Speziali, Via de' Cerretani, and the Viale dei Colli.\nFlorence also contains various parks and gardens. Such include the Boboli Gardens, the Parco delle Cascine, the Giardino Bardini and the Giardino dei Semplici, amongst others.\nDemographics.\nIn 1200 the city was home to 50,000 people. By 1300 the population of the city proper was 120,000, with an additional 300,000 living in the Contado. Between 1500 and 1650 the population was around 70,000.\n, the population of the city proper is 370,702, while Eurostat estimates that 696,767 people live in the urban area of Florence. The Metropolitan Area of Florence, Prato and Pistoia, constituted in 2000 over an area of roughly , is home to 1.5\u00a0million people. Within Florence proper, 46.8% of the population was male in 2007 and 53.2% were female. Minors (children aged 18 and less) totalled 14.10 percent of the population compared to pensioners, who numbered 25.95 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Florence resident is 49 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Florence grew by 3.22 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The birth rate of Florence is 7.66 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\n, 87.46% of the population was Italian. An estimated 6,000 Chinese live in the city. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (mostly Romanians and Albanians): 3.52%, East Asia (mostly Chinese and Filipino): 2.17%, the Americas: 1.41%, and North Africa (mostly Moroccan): 0.9%.\nMuch like the rest of Italy most of the people in Florence are Roman Catholic, with more than 90% of the population belonging to the Archdiocese of Florence.\nEconomy.\nTourism is, by far, the most important of all industries and most of the Florentine economy relies on the money generated by international arrivals and students studying in the city. The value tourism to the city totalled some \u20ac2.5\u00a0billion in 2015 and the number of visitors had increased by 5.5% from the previous year.\nIn 2013, Florence was listed as the second best world city by \"Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler\".\nManufacturing and commerce, however, still remain highly important. Florence is also Italy's 17th richest city in terms of average workers' earnings, with the figure being \u20ac23,265 (the overall city's income is \u20ac6,531,204,473), coming after Mantua, yet surpassing Bolzano.\nIndustry, commerce and services.\nFlorence is a major production and commercial centre in Italy, where the Florentine industrial complexes in the suburbs produce all sorts of goods, from furniture, rubber goods, chemicals, and food. However, traditional and local products, such as antiques, handicrafts, glassware, leatherwork, art reproductions, jewellery, souvenirs, elaborate metal and iron-work, shoes, accessories and high fashion clothes also dominate a fair sector of Florence's economy. The city's income relies partially on services and commercial and cultural interests, such as annual fairs, theatrical and lyrical productions, art exhibitions, festivals and fashion shows, such as the Calcio Fiorentino. Heavy industry and machinery also take their part in providing an income. In Nuovo Pignone, numerous factories are still present, and small-to medium industrial businesses are dominant. The Florence-Prato-Pistoia industrial districts and areas were known as the 'Third Italy' in the 1990s, due to the exports of high-quality goods and automobile (especially the Vespa) and the prosperity and productivity of the Florentine entrepreneurs. Some of these industries even rivalled the traditional industrial districts in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto due to high profits and productivity.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, manufacturing increased by 2.4% and exports increased by 7.2%. Leading sectors included mechanical engineering, fashion, pharmaceutics, food and wine. During 2015, permanent employment contracts increased by 48.8 percent, boosted by nationwide tax break.\nTourism.\nTourism is the most significant industry in central Florence. From April to October, tourists outnumber local population. Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia museums are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella, both of which charge for entry. Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting. In 2010, readers of \"Travel + Leisure\" magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination. In 2015, Cond\u00e9 Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe.\nStudies by Euromonitor International have concluded that cultural and history-oriented tourism is generating significantly increased spending throughout Europe.\nFlorence is believed to have the greatest concentration of art (in proportion to its size) in the world. Thus, cultural tourism is particularly strong, with world-renowned museums such as the Uffizi selling over 1.93\u00a0million tickets in 2014. The city's convention centre facilities were restructured during the 1990s and host exhibitions, conferences, meetings, social forums, concerts and other events all year.\nIn 2016, Florence had 20,588 hotel rooms in 570 facilities. International visitors use 75% of the rooms; some 18% of those were from the U.S. In 2014, the city had 8.5\u00a0million overnight stays. A Euromonitor report indicates that in 2015 the city ranked as the world's 36th most visited in the world, with over 4.95\u00a0million arrivals for the year.\nTourism brings revenue to Florence, but also creates certain problems. The Ponte Vecchio, The San Lorenzo Market and Santa Maria Novella are plagued by pickpockets. The province of Florence receives roughly 13\u00a0million visitors per year and in peak seasons, popular locations may become overcrowded as a result. In 2015, Mayor Dario Nardella expressed concern over visitors who arrive on buses, stay only a few hours, spend little money but contribute significantly to overcrowding. \"No museum visit, just a photo from the square, the bus back and then on to Venice... We don\u2019t want tourists like that,\" he said.\nSome tourists are less than respectful of the city's cultural heritage, according to Nardella. In June 2017, he instituted a programme of spraying church steps with water to prevent tourists from using such areas as picnic spots. While he values the benefits of tourism, he claims that there has been \"an increase among those who sit down on church steps, eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on them,\" he explained. To boost the sale of traditional foods, the mayor had introduced legislation (enacted in 2016) that requires restaurants to use typical Tuscan products and rejected McDonald's application to open a location in the Piazza del Duomo.\nFood and wine production.\nFood and wine have long been an important staple of the economy. The Chianti region is just south of the city, and its Sangiovese grapes figure prominently not only in its Chianti Classico wines but also in many of the more recently developed Supertuscan blends. Within to the west is the Carmignano area, also home to flavourful sangiovese-based reds. The celebrated Chianti Rufina district, geographically and historically separated from the main Chianti region, is also few kilometres east of Florence. More recently, the Bolgheri region (about southwest of Florence) has become celebrated for its \"Super Tuscan\" reds such as Sassicaia and Ornellaia.\nCulture.\nArt.\nFlorence was the birthplace of High Renaissance art, which lasted from 1450 to 1527. While Medieval art focused on basic story telling of the Bible, Renaissance art focused on naturalism and human emotion. Medieval art was abstract, formulaic, and largely produced by monks whereas Renaissance art was rational, mathematical, individualistic, consisted of linear perspective and shading (Chiaroscuro) and produced by specialists (Leonardo da Vinci, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael). Religion was important, but with this new age came the humanization of religious figures in art, such as Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, Ecce Homo (Bosch, 1470s), and Madonna Della Seggiola; People of this age began to understand themselves as human beings, which reflected in art. The Renaissance marked the rebirth of classical values in art and society as people studied the ancient masters of the Greco-Roman world; Art became focused on realism as opposed to idealism.\nCimabue and Giotto, the fathers of Italian painting, lived in Florence as well as Arnolfo and Andrea Pisano, renewers of architecture and sculpture; Brunelleschi, Donatello and Masaccio, forefathers of the Renaissance, Ghiberti and the Della Robbias, Filippo Lippi and Angelico; Botticelli, Paolo Uccello and the universal genius of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.\nTheir works, together with those of many other generations of artists, are gathered in the several museums of the town: the Uffizi Gallery, the Palatina gallery with the paintings of the \"Golden Ages\", the Bargello with the sculptures of the Renaissance, the museum of San Marco with Fra Angelico's works, the Academy, the chapels of the Medicis Buonarroti's house with the sculptures of Michelangelo, the following museums: Bardini, Horne, Stibbert, Romano, Corsini, The Gallery of Modern Art, the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, the museum of Silverware and the museum of Precious Stones.\nSeveral monuments are located in Florence: the Florence Baptistery with its mosaics; the cathedral with its sculptures, the medieval churches with bands of frescoes; public as well as private palaces: Palazzo Vecchio, Palazzo Pitti, Palazzo Medici Riccardi, Palazzo Davanzati; monasteries, cloisters, refectories; the \"Certosa\". In the archaeological museum includes documents of Etruscan civilisation. In fact the city is so rich in art that some first time visitors experience the Stendhal syndrome as they encounter its art for the first time.\nFlorentine architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi (1377\u20131466) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404\u20131472) were among the fathers of both Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture.\nThe cathedral, topped by Brunelleschi's dome, dominates the Florentine skyline. The Florentines decided to start building it \u2013 late in the 13th century, without a design for the dome. The project proposed by Brunelleschi in the 14th century was the largest ever built at the time, and the first major dome built in Europe since the two great domes of Roman times \u2013 the Pantheon in Rome, and Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore remains the largest brick construction of its kind in the world. In front of it is the medieval Baptistery. The two buildings incorporate in their decoration the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. In recent years, most of the important works of art from the two buildings \u2013 and from the nearby Giotto's Campanile, have been removed and replaced by copies. The originals are now housed in the Museum dell'Opera del Duomo, just to the east of the cathedral.\nFlorence has large numbers of art-filled churches, such as San Miniato al Monte, San Lorenzo, Santa Maria Novella, Santa Trinita, Santa Maria del Carmine, Santa Croce, Santo Spirito, the Annunziata, Ognissanti and numerous others.\nArtists associated with Florence range from Arnolfo di Cambio and Cimabue to Giotto, Nanni di Banco, and Paolo Uccello; through Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Donatello and Massaccio and the della Robbia family; through Fra Angelico and Botticelli and Piero della Francesca, and on to Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Others include Benvenuto Cellini, Andrea del Sarto, Benozzo Gozzoli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Filippo Lippi, Bernardo Buontalenti, Orcagna, Pollaiuolo, Filippino Lippi, Verrocchio, Bronzino, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelozzo, the Rossellis, the Sangallos, and Pontormo. Artists from other regions who worked in Florence include Raphael, Andrea Pisano, Giambologna, Il Sodoma and Peter Paul Rubens.\nPicture galleries in Florence include the Uffizi and the Pitti Palace. Two superb collections of sculpture are in the Bargello and the Museum of the Works of the Duomo. They are filled with the creations of Donatello, Verrochio, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelangelo and others. The Galleria dell'Accademia has Michelangelo's David \u2013 perhaps the best-known work of art anywhere, plus the unfinished statues of the slaves Michelangelo created for the tomb of Pope Julius II. Other sights include the medieval city hall, the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as the Palazzo Vecchio), the Archeological Museum, the Museum of the History of Science, the Garden of Archimedes, the Palazzo Davanzatti, the Stibbert Museum, St. Marks, the Medici Chapels, the Museum of the Works of Santa Croce, the Museum of the Cloister of Santa Maria Novella, the Zoological Museum (\"La Specola\"), the Bardini, and the Museo Horne. There is also a collection of works by the modern sculptor, Marino Marini, in a museum named after him. The Strozzi Palace is the site of special exhibits.\nLanguage.\nFlorentine (\"fiorentino\"), spoken by inhabitants of Florence and its environs, is a Tuscan dialect and the immediate parent language to modern Italian.\nAlthough its vocabulary and pronunciation are largely identical to standard Italian, differences do exist. The \"Vocabolario del fiorentino contemporaneo\" (Dictionary of Modern Florentine) reveals lexical distinctions from all walks of life. Florentines have a highly recognisable accent in phonetic terms due to the so-called gorgia toscana): \"hard \"c\"\" between two vowels is pronounced as a fricative similar to an English \"h\", so that \"dico\" 'I say' is phonetically , \"i cani\" 'the dogs' is . Similarly, \"t\" between vowels is pronounced as in English \"thin\", and \"p\" in the same position is the bilabial fricative . Other traits include using a form of the subjunctive mood last commonly used in medieval times, a frequent usage in everyday speech of the modern subjunctive, and a shortened pronunciation of the definite article, instead of \"il\", causing doubling of the consonant that follows, so that \"il cane\" 'the dog', for example, is pronounced .\nDante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular instead of the Latin used for most literary works at the time.\nLiterature.\nDespite Latin being the main language of the courts and the Church in the Middle Ages, writers such as Dante Alighieri and many others used their own language, the Florentine vernacular descended from Latin, in composing their greatest works. The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century. Florence's literature fully blossomed in the 14th century, when not only Dante with his \"Divine Comedy\" (1306\u20131321) and Petrarch, but also poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Lapo Gianni composed their most important works. Dante's masterpiece is the \"Divine Comedy\", which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before. He is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil, whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell. Later on he is joined by Beatrice, who guides him through Heaven.\nIn the 14th century, Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio led the literary scene in Florence after Dante's death in 1321. Petrarch was an all-rounder writer, author and poet, but was particularly known for his \"Canzoniere\", or the Book of Songs, where he conveyed his unremitting love for Laura. His style of writing has since become known as \"Petrarchism\". Boccaccio was better known for his \"Decameron\", a slightly grim story of Florence during the 1350s bubonic plague, known as the Black Death, when some people fled the ravaged city to an isolated country mansion, and spent their time there recounting stories and novellas taken from the medieval and contemporary tradition. All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas.\nIn the 16th century, during the Renaissance, Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land, detailed in \"The Prince\", spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries. These principles became known as \"Machiavellianism\".\nMusic.\nFlorence became a musical centre during the Middle Ages and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture. The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence. During the Renaissance, there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private. It was here that the Florentine Camerata convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result\u2014in other words, the first operas, setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form, but for later developments of separate \"classical\" forms such as the symphony and concerto. After the year 1600, Italian trends prevailed across Europe, by 1750 it was the primary musical language. The genre of the Madrigal, born in Italy, gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere. Several Italian cities were \"larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested. Florence, was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation, including the beginning and flourishing of opera.\nOpera was invented in Florence in the late 16th century when Jacobo Peri's \"Dafne\" an opera in the style of monody, was premiered. Opera spread from Florence throughout Italy and eventually Europe. Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time. At the beginning of the 17th century, two practices for writing music were devised, one the first practice or \"Stile Antico/Prima Prattica\" the other the \"Stile Moderno/Seconda Prattica\". The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time.\nComposers and musicians who have lived in Florence include Piero Strozzi (1550 \u2013 after 1608), Giulio Caccini (1551\u20131618) and Mike Francis (1961\u20132009). Giulio Caccini's book \"Le Nuove Musiche\" was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time. The book specified a new term, in use by the 1630s, called monody which indicated the combination of voice and basso continuo and connoted a practice of stating text in a free, lyrical, yet speech-like manner. This would occur while an instrument, usually a keyboard type such as harpsichord, played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line.\nCinema.\nFlorence has been a setting for numerous works of fiction and movies, including the novels and associated films, such as \"Light in the Piazza\", \"The Girl Who Couldn't Say No\", \"Calmi Cuori Appassionati\", \"Hannibal\", \"A Room with a View\", \"Tea with Mussolini\", \"Virgin Territory\" and \"Inferno\". The city is home to renowned Italian actors and actresses, such as Roberto Benigni, Leonardo Pieraccioni and Vittoria Puccini.\nVideo games.\nFlorence has appeared as a location in video games such as \"Assassins Creed II.\" The Republic of Florence also appears as a playable nation in Paradox Interactive's grand strategy game \"Europa Universalis IV.\"\nOther Media.\n16th century Florence is the setting of the Japanese manga and anime series \"Arte\".\nCuisine.\nFlorentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant eating rather than rarefied high cooking. The majority of dishes are based on meat. The whole animal was traditionally eaten; tripe (\"trippa\") and stomach (\"lampredotto\") were once regularly on the menu and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city. Antipasti include \"crostini toscani\", sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based p\u00e2t\u00e9, and sliced meats (mainly prosciutto and salame, often served with melon when in season). The typically saltless Tuscan bread, obtained with natural levain frequently features in Florentine courses, especially in its soups, \"ribollita\" and \"pappa al pomodoro\", or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called \"panzanella\" that is served in summer. The \"bistecca alla fiorentina\" is a large (the customary size should weigh around ) \u2013 the \"date\" steak \u2013 T-bone steak of Chianina beef cooked over hot charcoal and served very rare with its more recently derived version, the \"tagliata\", sliced rare beef served on a bed of arugula, often with slices of Parmesan cheese on top. Most of these courses are generally served with local olive oil, also a prime product enjoying a worldwide reputation. Among the desserts, \"schiacciata alla fiorentina\", a white flatbread cake, is one of the most popular; it is a very soft cake, prepared with extremely simple ingredients, typical of Florentine cuisine, and is especially eaten at Carnival.\nResearch activity.\nResearch institutes and university departments are located within the Florence area and within two campuses at\nPolo di Novoli and Polo Scientifico di Sesto Fiorentino as well as in the Research Area of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.\nScience and discovery.\nFlorence has been an important scientific centre for centuries, notably during the Renaissance with scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci.\nFlorentines were one of the driving forces behind the Age of Discovery. Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, a student of Brunelleschi, that Christopher Columbus used to sell his \"enterprise\" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he used on his first voyage. Mercator's \"Projection\" is a refined version of Toscanelli's, taking the Americas into account.\nGalileo and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and other scientific disciplines. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for modern scientific understanding.\nFashion.\nBy the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe. Many of the rich families in Renaissance Florence were major purchasers of locally produced fine clothing, and the specialists of fashion in the economy and culture of Florence during that period is often underestimated. Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern (post World War Two) fashion industry in Italy. The Florentine \"soir\u00e9es\" of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention. Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company Salvatore Ferragamo since 1928. Gucci, Roberto Cavalli, and Emilio Pucci are also headquartered in Florence. Other major players in the fashion industry such as Prada and Chanel have large offices and stores in Florence or its outskirts. Florence's main upscale shopping street is Via de' Tornabuoni, where major luxury fashion houses and jewellery labels, such as Armani and Bulgari, have their elegant boutiques. Via del Parione and Via Roma are other streets that are also well known for their high-end fashion stores.\nHistorical evocations.\n\"Scoppio del Carro\".\nThe \"Scoppio del Carro\" (\"Explosion of the Cart\") is a celebration of the First Crusade. During the day of Easter, a cart, which the Florentines call the \"Brindellone\" and which is led by four white oxen, is taken to the Piazza del Duomo between the Baptistery of St. John the Baptist (\"Battistero di San Giovanni\") and the Florence Cathedral (\"Santa Maria del Fiore\"). The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church. Near the cart there is a model of a dove, which, according to legend, is a symbol of good luck for the city: at the end of the Easter mass, the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart.\n\"Calcio Storico\".\n\"Calcio Storico Fiorentino\" (\"Historic Florentine Football\"), sometimes called \"Calcio in costume\", is a traditional sport, regarded as a forerunner of soccer, though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby. The event originates from the Middle Ages, when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes. The most important match was played on 17 February 1530, during the siege of Florence. That day Papal troops besieged the city while the Florentines, with contempt of the enemies, decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation. The game is played in the Piazza di Santa Croce. A temporary arena is constructed, with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field. A series of matches are held between four teams representing each \"quartiere \"(quarter) of Florence during late June and early July. There are four teams: Azzurri (light blue), Bianchi (white), Rossi (red) and Verdi (green). The Azzurri are from the quarter of Santa Croce, Bianchi from the quarter of Santo Spirito, Verdi are from San Giovanni and Rossi from Santa Maria Novella.\nSport.\nIn association football Florence is represented by ACF Fiorentina, which plays in Serie A, the top league of Italian league system.\nACF Fiorentina has won two Italian Championships, in 1956 and 1969, and 6 Italian cups, since their formation in 1926. They play their games at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, which holds 47,282.\nThe female squad of ACF Fiorentina have won the women's association football Italian Championship of the 2016\u201317 season.\nThe city is home of the Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano, in Coverciano, Florence, the main training ground of the Italian national team, and the technical department of the Italian Football Federation.\nFlorence was selected to host the 2013 UCI World Road Cycling Championships.\nSince 2017 Florence is also represented in Eccellenza, the top tier of rugby union league system in Italy, by I Medicei, which is a club established in 2015 by the merging of the senior squads of I Cavalieri (of Prato) and Firenze Rugby 1931.\nI Medicei won the Serie A Championship in 2016\u201317 and were promoted to Eccellenza for the 2017\u201318 season.\nRari Nantes Florentia is a successful water polo club based in Florence; both its male and female squads have won several Italian championships and the female squad has also European titles in their palmar\u00e8s.\nEducation.\nThe University of Florence was first founded in 1321, and was recognized by Pope Clement VI in 1349. In 2019, over 50,000 students were enrolled at the university.\nThe European University Institute has been based in the suburb of Fiesole since 1976.\nSeveral American universities host a campus in Florence. Including New York University, Marist College, Pepperdine, Stanford, Florida State and James Madison. Another center of crucial importance is Villa I Tatti, the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies. The center for arts and humanities advanced research is located on the border of Florence, Fiesole and Settignano since 1961. Over 8,000 American students are enrolled for study in Florence.\nThe private school, Centro Machiavelli which teaches Italian language and culture to foreigners, is located in Piazza Santo Spirito in Florence.\nTransportation.\nCars.\nThe centre of Florence is closed to through-traffic, although buses, taxis and residents with appropriate permits are allowed in. This area is commonly referred to as the ZTL (\"Zona Traffico Limitato\"), which is divided into several subsections. Residents of one section, therefore, will only be able to drive in their district and perhaps some surrounding ones. Cars without permits are allowed to enter after 7.30\u00a0pm, or before 7.30\u00a0am. The rules shift during the tourist-filled summers, putting more restrictions on where one can get in and out.\nBuses.\nThe principal public transit network in the city is run by the ATAF and Li-nea bus company. Individual tickets, or a pass called Carta Agile with multiple rides, are purchased in advance and must be validated once on board. These tickets may be used on ATAF and Li-nea buses, Tramvia and second-class local trains only within city railway stations. Train tickets must be validated before boarding. The main bus station is next to Santa Maria Novella railway station. Trenitalia runs trains between the railway stations within the city, and to other destinations around Italy and Europe. The central railway station, Santa Maria Novella, is about northwest of the Piazza del Duomo. There are two other important stations: Campo di Marte and Rifredi. Most bundled routes are Firenze\u2014Pisa, Firenze\u2014Viareggio and Firenze-Arezzo (along the main line to Rome). Other local railways connect Florence with Borgo San Lorenzo in the Mugello area (Faentina railway) and Siena.\nLong distance buses are run by the SITA, Copit, and CAP companies. The transit companies also accommodate travellers from the Amerigo Vespucci Airport, which is west of the city centre, and which has scheduled services run by major European carriers.\nTrams.\nIn an effort to reduce air pollution and car traffic in the city, a multi-line tram network called \"Tramvia\" is under construction. The first line began operation on 14 February 2010 and connects Florence's primary intercity railway station (Santa Maria Novella) with the southwestern suburb of Scandicci. This line is long and has 14 stops. The construction of a second line began on 5 November 2011, construction was stopped due to contractors' difficulties and restarted in 2014 with the new line opening on 11 February 2019. This second line connects Florence's airport with the city centre. A third line (from Santa Maria Novella to the Careggi area, where the most important hospitals of Florence are located) is also under construction.\nFlorence public transport statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Firenze, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 59 min. 13% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 22% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.1\u00a0km, while 3% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single direction.\nRailway station.\nFirenze Santa Maria Novella railway station is the main national and international railway station in Florence and is used by 59\u00a0million people every year. The building, designed by Giovanni Michelucci, was built in the \"Italian Rationalism\" style and it is one of the major rationalist buildings in Italy. It is located in \"Piazza della Stazione\", near the Fortezza da Basso (a masterpiece of the military Renaissance architecture) and the Viali di Circonvallazione, and in front of the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella's apse from which it takes its name. As well as numerous high speed trains to major Italian cities Florence is served by international overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna operated by Austrian railways \u00d6BB.\nA new high-speed rail station is under construction and is contracted to be operational by 2015. It is planned to be connected to Vespucci airport, Santa Maria Novella railway station, and to the city centre by the second line of Tramvia. The architectural firms Foster + Partners and Lancietti Passaleva Giordo and Associates designed this new rail station.\nAirport.\nThe Florence Airport, Peretola, is one of two main airports in the Tuscany region though it is not widely used by popular airlines. The other airport in the Tuscany region is the Galileo Galilei International Airport in Pisa.\nMobike (bike-sharing).\nMobike, a Chinese dockless bike sharing company, has been operating in Florence since July 2017. As of 2019, the company operates 4,000 bikes in Florence. The users scan the QR code on the bike using the Mobike app, and end the ride by parking curbside. The bikes have a fixed rate of \u20ac1 every 20 minutes. Since Mobike is a dock-less bike-sharing system, it does not provide stations, therefore the bikes can be left almost anywhere.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nFlorence is twinned with:"}
{"id": "11526", "revid": "1008553438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11526", "title": "Quotient group", "text": "A quotient group or factor group is a mathematical group obtained by aggregating similar elements of a larger group using an equivalence relation that preserves some of the group structure (the rest of the structure is \"factored\" out). For example, the cyclic group of addition modulo \"n\" can be obtained from the group of integers under addition by identifying elements that differ by a multiple of \"n\" and defining a group structure that operates on each such class (known as a congruence class) as a single entity. It is part of the mathematical field known as group theory.\nIn a quotient of a group, the equivalence class of the identity element is always a normal subgroup of the original group, and the other equivalence classes are precisely the cosets of that normal subgroup. The resulting quotient is written , where \"G\" is the original group and \"N\" is the normal subgroup. (This is pronounced \"\"G\" mod \"N\"\", where \"mod\" is short for modulo.)\nMuch of the importance of quotient groups is derived from their relation to homomorphisms. The first isomorphism theorem states that the image of any group \"G\" under a homomorphism is always isomorphic to a quotient of \"G\". Specifically, the image of \"G\" under a homomorphism is isomorphic to where ker(\"\u03c6\") denotes the kernel of \"\u03c6\".\nThe dual notion of a quotient group is a subgroup, these being the two primary ways of forming a smaller group from a larger one. Any normal subgroup has a corresponding quotient group, formed from the larger group by eliminating the distinction between elements of the subgroup. In category theory, quotient groups are examples of quotient objects, which are dual to subobjects. For other examples of quotient objects, see quotient ring, quotient space (linear algebra), quotient space (topology), and quotient set.\nDefinition and illustration.\nGiven a group \"G\" and a subgroup \"H\", and an element \"a\" \u2208 \"G\", one can consider the corresponding left coset: \"aH\" := { \"ah\" : \"h\" \u2208 \"H\" }. Cosets are a natural class of subsets of a group; for example consider the abelian group \"G\" of integers, with operation defined by the usual addition, and the subgroup \"H\" of even integers. Then there are exactly two cosets: 0 + \"H\", which are the even integers, and 1 + \"H\", which are the odd integers (here we are using additive notation for the binary operation instead of multiplicative notation).\nFor a general subgroup \"H\", it is desirable to define a compatible group operation on the set of all possible cosets, { \"aH\" : \"a\" \u2208 \"G\" }. This is possible exactly when \"H\" is a normal subgroup, see below. A subgroup \"N\" of a group \"G\" is normal if and only if the coset equality \"aN\" = \"Na\" holds for all \"a\" \u2208 \"G\". A normal subgroup of \"G\" is denoted .\nDefinition.\nLet \"N\" be a normal subgroup of a group \"G\". Define the set \"G\"/\"N\" to be the set of all left cosets of \"N\" in \"G\". That is, . Since the identity element \"e\" \u2208 \"N\", \"a\" \u2208 \"aN\". Define a binary operation on the set of cosets, \"G\"/\"N\", as follows. For each \"aN\" and \"bN\" in \"G\"/\"N\", the product of \"aN\" and \"bN\", (\"aN\")(\"bN\"), is (\"ab\")\"N\". This works only because (\"ab\")\"N\" does not depend on the choice of the representatives, \"a\" and \"b\", of each left coset, \"aN\" and \"bN\". To prove this, suppose \"xN\" = \"aN\" and \"yN\" = \"bN\" for some \"x\", \"y\", \"a\", \"b\" \u2208 \"G\". Then\nThis depends on the fact that \"N\" is a normal subgroup. It still remains to be shown that this condition is not only sufficient but necessary to define the operation on \"G\"/\"N\".\nTo show that it is necessary, consider that for a subgroup \"N\" of \"G\", we have been given that the operation is well defined. That is, for all \"xN\" = \"aN\" and \"yN\" = \"bN,\" for \"x\", \"y\", \"a\", \"b\" \u2208 \"G\", (\"ab\")\"N\" = (\"xy\")\"N.\"\nLet \"n\" \u2208 \"N\" and \"g\" \u2208 \"G\". Since \"eN\" = \"nN,\" we have, \"gN\" = (\"eg\")\"N\" = (\"ng\")\"N.\"\nNow, \"gN\" = (\"ng\")\"N\" \u21d4 \"N\" = \"g\"\u22121(\"ng\")\"N\" \u21d4 \"g\"\u22121\"ng\" \u2208 \"N\" \u2200 \"n\" \u2208 \"N\" and \"g\" \u2208 \"G\".\nHence \"N\" is a normal subgroup of \"G\".\nIt can also be checked that this operation on \"G\"/\"N\" is always associative. \"G\"/\"N\" has identity element \"N\" and the inverse of element \"aN\" can always be represented by \"a\"\u22121\"N\". Therefore, the set \"G\"/\"N\" together with the operation defined by (\"aN\")(\"bN\") = (\"ab\")\"N\" forms a group, the quotient group of \"G\" by \"N\".\nDue to the normality of \"N\", the left cosets and right cosets of \"N\" in \"G\" are the same, and so, \"G\"/\"N\" could have been defined to be the set of right cosets of \"N\" in \"G\".\nExample: Addition modulo 6.\nFor example, consider the group with addition modulo 6: \"G\" = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Consider the subgroup \"N\" = {0, 3}, which is normal because \"G\" is abelian. Then the set of (left) cosets is of size three:\nThe binary operation defined above makes this set into a group, known as the quotient group, which in this case is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3.\nMotivation for the name \"quotient\".\nThe reason \"G\"/\"N\" is called a quotient group comes from division of integers. When dividing 12 by 3 one obtains the answer 4 because one can regroup 12 objects into 4 subcollections of 3 objects. The quotient group is the same idea, although we end up with a group for a final answer instead of a number because groups have more structure than an arbitrary collection of objects.\nTo elaborate, when looking at \"G\"/\"N\" with \"N\" a normal subgroup of \"G\", the group structure is used to form a natural \"regrouping\". These are the cosets of \"N\" in \"G\". Because we started with a group and normal subgroup, the final quotient contains more information than just the number of cosets (which is what regular division yields), but instead has a group structure itself.\nExamples.\nEven and odd integers.\nConsider the group of integers Z (under addition) and the subgroup 2Z consisting of all even integers. This is a normal subgroup, because Z is abelian. There are only two cosets: the set of even integers and the set of odd integers, and therefore the quotient group Z/2Z is the cyclic group with two elements. This quotient group is isomorphic with the set with addition modulo\u00a02; informally, it is sometimes said that Z/2Z \"equals\" the set with addition modulo 2.\nExample further explained...\nRemainders of integer division.\nA slight generalization of the last example. Once again consider the group of integers Z under addition. Let \"n\" be any positive integer. We will consider the subgroup \"nZ of Z consisting of all multiples of \"n\". Once again \"nZ is normal in Z because Z is abelian. The cosets are the collection {\"nZ, 1+\"nZ, ..., (\"n\"\u22122)+\"nZ, (\"n\"\u22121)+\"nZ}. An integer \"k\" belongs to the coset \"r\"+\"nZ, where \"r\" is the remainder when dividing \"k\" by \"n\". The quotient Z/\"nZ can be thought of as the group of \"remainders\" modulo \"n\". This is a cyclic group of order \"n\".\nComplex integer roots of 1.\nThe twelfth roots of unity, which are points on the complex unit circle, form a multiplicative abelian group \"G\", shown on the picture on the right as colored balls with the number at each point giving its complex argument. Consider its subgroup \"N\" made of the fourth roots of unity, shown as red balls. This normal subgroup splits the group into three cosets, shown in red, green and blue. One can check that the cosets form a group of three elements (the product of a red element with a blue element is blue, the inverse of a blue element is green, etc.). Thus, the quotient group \"G\"/\"N\" is the group of three colors, which turns out to be the cyclic group with three elements.\nThe real numbers modulo the integers.\nConsider the group of real numbers R under addition, and the subgroup Z of integers. Each coset of Z in R is a set of the form \"a\"+Z, where \"a\" is a real number. Since \"a1\"+Z and \"a2\"+Z are identical sets when the non-integer parts of \"a1\" and \"a2\" are equal, one may impose the restriction without change of meaning. Adding such cosets is done by adding the corresponding real numbers, and subtracting 1 if the result is greater than or equal to 1. The quotient group R/Z is isomorphic to the circle group, the group of complex numbers of absolute value 1 under multiplication, or correspondingly, the group of rotations in 2D about the origin, that is, the special orthogonal group SO(2). An isomorphism is given by (see Euler's identity).\nMatrices of real numbers.\nIf \"G\" is the group of invertible 3 \u00d7 3 real matrices, and \"N\" is the subgroup of 3 \u00d7 3 real matrices with determinant 1, then \"N\" is normal in \"G\" (since it is the kernel of the determinant homomorphism). The cosets of \"N\" are the sets of matrices with a given determinant, and hence \"G\"/\"N\" is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers. The group \"N\" is known as the special linear group SL(3).\nInteger modular arithmetic.\nConsider the abelian group (that is, the set with addition modulo 4), and its subgroup . The quotient group is . This is a group with identity element , and group operations such as . Both the subgroup and the quotient group are isomorphic with Z2.\nInteger multiplication.\nConsider the multiplicative group formula_39. The set \"N\" of \"n\"th residues is a multiplicative subgroup isomorphic to formula_40. Then \"N\" is normal in \"G\" and the factor group \"G\"/\"N\" has the cosets \"N\", (1+\"n\")\"N\", (1+\"n\")2N, ..., (1+\"n\")\"n\"\u22121N. The Paillier cryptosystem is based on the conjecture that it is difficult to determine the coset of a random element of \"G\" without knowing the factorization of \"n\".\nProperties.\nThe quotient group is isomorphic to the trivial group (the group with one element), and is isomorphic to \"G\".\nThe order of , by definition the number of elements, is equal to , the index of \"N\" in \"G\". If \"G\" is finite, the index is also equal to the order of \"G\" divided by the order of \"N\". The set may be finite, although both \"G\" and \"N\" are infinite (for example, ).\nThere is a \"natural\" surjective group homomorphism , sending each element \"g\" of \"G\" to the coset of \"N\" to which \"g\" belongs, that is: . The mapping \"\u03c0\" is sometimes called the \"canonical projection of G onto \". Its kernel is \"N\".\nThere is a bijective correspondence between the subgroups of \"G\" that contain \"N\" and the subgroups of ; if \"H\" is a subgroup of \"G\" containing \"N\", then the corresponding subgroup of is \"\u03c0\"(\"H\"). This correspondence holds for normal subgroups of \"G\" and as well, and is formalized in the lattice theorem.\nSeveral important properties of quotient groups are recorded in the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms and the isomorphism theorems.\nIf \"G\" is abelian, nilpotent, solvable, cyclic or finitely generated, then so is .\nIf \"H\" is a subgroup in a finite group \"G\", and the order of \"H\" is one half of the order of \"G\", then \"H\" is guaranteed to be a normal subgroup, so exists and is isomorphic to \"C\"2. This result can also be stated as \"any subgroup of index 2 is normal\", and in this form it applies also to infinite groups. Furthermore, if \"p\" is the smallest prime number dividing the order of a finite group, \"G\", then if has order \"p\", \"H\" must be a normal subgroup of \"G\".\nGiven \"G\" and a normal subgroup \"N\", then \"G\" is a group extension of by \"N\". One could ask whether this extension is trivial or split; in other words, one could ask whether \"G\" is a direct product or semidirect product of \"N\" and . This is a special case of the extension problem. An example where the extension is not split is as follows: Let \"G\" = Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}, and \"N\" = {0, 2}, which is isomorphic to Z2. Then is also isomorphic to Z2. But Z2 has only the trivial automorphism, so the only semi-direct product of \"N\" and is the direct product. Since Z4 is different from , we conclude that \"G\" is not a semi-direct product of \"N\" and .\nQuotients of Lie groups.\nIf \"formula_41\" is a Lie group and \"formula_42\" is a normal and closed (in the topological rather than the algebraic sense of the word) Lie subgroup of \"formula_41\", the quotient is also a Lie group. In this case, the original group \"formula_41\" has the structure of a fiber bundle (specifically, a principal \"formula_42\"-bundle), with base space and fiber \"formula_42\". The dimension of equals formula_47.\nNote that the condition that \"formula_42\" is closed is necessary. Indeed, if \"formula_42\" is not closed then the quotient space is not a T1-space (since there is a coset in the quotient which cannot be separated from the identity by an open set), and thus not a Hausdorff space.\nFor a non-normal Lie subgroup \"formula_42\", the space of left cosets is not a group, but simply a differentiable manifold on which \"formula_41\" acts. The result is known as a homogeneous space."}

Fermions include all quarks and leptons, as well as all composite particles made of an odd number of these, such as all baryons and many atoms and nuclei. Fermions differ from bosons, which obey Bose\u2013Einstein statistics.\nSome fermions are elementary particles, such as the electrons, and some are composite particles, such as the protons. According to the spin-statistics theorem in relativistic quantum field theory, particles with integer spin are bosons, while particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\nIn addition to the spin characteristic, fermions have another specific property: they possess conserved baryon or lepton quantum numbers. Therefore, what is usually referred to as the spin statistics relation is in fact a spin statistics-quantum number relation.\nAs a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, only one fermion can occupy a particular quantum state at a given time. If multiple fermions have the same spatial probability distribution, then at least one property of each fermion, such as its spin, must be different. Fermions are usually associated with matter, whereas bosons are generally force carrier particles, although in the current state of particle physics the distinction between the two concepts is unclear. Weakly interacting fermions can also display bosonic behavior under extreme conditions. At low temperature fermions show superfluidity for uncharged particles and superconductivity for charged particles.\nComposite fermions, such as protons and neutrons, are the key building blocks of everyday matter.\nThe name fermion was coined by English theoretical physicist Paul Dirac from the surname of Italian physicist Enrico Fermi.\nElementary fermions.\nThe Standard Model recognizes two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons. In all, the model distinguishes 24 different fermions. There are six quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom and top), and six leptons (electron, electron neutrino, muon, muon neutrino, tauon and tauon neutrino), along with the corresponding antiparticle of each of these.\nMathematically, fermions come in three types:\nMost Standard Model fermions are believed to be Dirac fermions, although it is unknown at this time whether the neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana fermions (or both). Dirac fermions can be treated as a combination of two Weyl fermions. In July 2015, Weyl fermions have been experimentally realized in Weyl semimetals.\nComposite fermions.\nComposite particles (such as hadrons, nuclei, and atoms) can be bosons or fermions depending on their constituents. More precisely, because of the relation between spin and statistics, a particle containing an odd number of fermions is itself a fermion. It will have half-integer spin.\nExamples include the following:\nThe number of bosons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a boson or a fermion.\nFermionic or bosonic behavior of a composite particle (or system) is only seen at large (compared to size of the system) distances. At proximity, where spatial structure begins to be important, a composite particle (or system) behaves according to its constituent makeup.\nFermions can exhibit bosonic behavior when they become loosely bound in pairs. This is the origin of superconductivity and the superfluidity of helium-3: in superconducting materials, electrons interact through the exchange of phonons, forming Cooper pairs, while in helium-3, Cooper pairs are formed via spin fluctuations.\nThe quasiparticles of the fractional quantum Hall effect are also known as composite fermions, which are electrons with an even number of quantized vortices attached to them.\nSkyrmions.\nIn a quantum field theory, there can be field configurations of bosons which are topologically twisted. These are coherent states (or solitons) which behave like a particle, and they can be fermionic even if all the constituent particles are bosons. This was discovered by Tony Skyrme in the early 1960s, so fermions made of bosons are named skyrmions after him.\nSkyrme's original example involved fields which take values on a three-dimensional sphere, the original nonlinear sigma model which describes the large distance behavior of pions. In Skyrme's model, reproduced in the large N or string approximation to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the proton and neutron are fermionic topological solitons of the pion field.\nWhereas Skyrme's example involved pion physics, there is a much more familiar example in quantum electrodynamics with a magnetic monopole. A bosonic monopole with the smallest possible magnetic charge and a bosonic version of the electron will form a fermionic dyon."}

He then appeared onscreen in \"The Boy Who Could Fly\", \"Dinosaurs! - A Fun-Filled Trip Back in Time!\", and several television shows, including \"The Twilight Zone\" and \"Crime Story\" before gaining national attention as the grandson in the 1987 film \"The Princess Bride\" opposite Peter Falk.\nIn 1988, Savage appeared as Kevin Arnold on \"The Wonder Years\", the role for which he is best known, and for which he received two Golden Globe nominations and two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. At the age of thirteen, he was the youngest actor ever to receive these honors. He remained on the show until it ended in 1993. During this period, he appeared in several films, most notably \"Vice Versa\" (1988), and also starred in \"Little Monsters\". After \"The Wonder Years\" ended, Savage returned to high school at age 17, and later attended Stanford. His first television role after high school was the NBC sitcom \"Working\", which Savage starred in for its two-season run. Savage also had a series of guest and supporting roles in the late 1990s and the 2000s such as on the show \"Boy Meets World\" (which starred his younger brother Ben Savage) and in the film \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" as The Mole.\nSavage has lent his voice to several animated projects, including \"Family Guy\", \"Kim Possible\", \"Justice League Unlimited\", \"Oswald\", and \"Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn't Happen\". His two lead roles since \"The Wonder Years\" were on the short-lived sitcoms \"Working\" and \"Crumbs\". He appeared as a serial rapist on a 2003 episode of \"\" and as a womanizing professor on \"Boy Meets World\". He ranked at #27 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Kid Stars\".\nIn July 2008, Savage guest-starred in the web series \"The Rascal\" on Crackle.\nIn 2015, Savage returned to acting with the Fox series \"The Grinder\". Producer Nick Stoller approached Savage about playing the role of Stewart on \"The Grinder\". Savage was uninterested at first, but agreed to meet with the producers of the series because his children attended school with Stoller's children. Savage eventually agreed to take on the role. \"The Grinder\" was canceled by Fox on May 16, 2016.\nIn 2017, he joined the cast of the Netflix series \"Friends from College\" as Max Adler, a gay literary agent.\nDirecting and producing.\nIn 1999, Savage began his directing career in which he helmed episodes of over a dozen television series. Savage's first directing credit was on the short-lived NBC sitcom \"Working\" which also starred Savage. Following \"Working\", Savage began observing production on the Disney Channel show \"Even Stevens\" to further learn the craft of directing. Savage also learned by shadowing Amy Sherman-Palladino, Todd Holland, and James Burrows.\nHis credits include \"Boy Meets World\", \"Drake &amp; Josh\" and \"Ned's Declassified\" for Nickelodeon, as well as \"That's So Raven\", \"Hannah Montana\", and \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" for Disney Channel. Additionally, Savage has directed for prime-time network sitcoms including \"Modern Family\" and \"2 Broke Girls\".\nBesides directing several episodes, Savage co-produced the Disney Channel Original Series \"Phil of the Future\". In 2007, he was nominated for a Directors Guild award for the \"Phil\" episode \"Not-So-Great-Great Grandpa\".\nSavage has served as a producer for several episodes of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", \"Friends with Benefits\", \"Party Down\", \"Phil of the Future\", \"The Crazy Ones\", and \"Happy Endings\".\nIn 2007, he made his feature film directing debut with the film \"Daddy Day Camp\"."}
{"id": "11531", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11531", "title": "Futurians", "text": "The Futurians were a group of science fiction (SF) fans, many of whom became editors and writers as well. The Futurians were based in New York City and were a major force in the development of science fiction writing and science fiction fandom in the years 1937\u20131945.\nOrigins of the group.\nAs described in Isaac Asimov's 1979 autobiography \"In Memory Yet Green\", the Futurians spun off from the Greater New York Science Fiction Club (headed by Sam Moskowitz, later an influential SF editor and historian) over ideological differences, with the Futurians wishing to take a more overtly Marxist political stance. Other sources indicate that Donald A. Wollheim was pushing for a more left-wing direction with a goal of leading fandom toward a political ideal, all of which Moskowitz resisted. As a result, Wollheim broke off from the Greater New York group and founded the Futurians in September, 1938. The fans following Moskowitz reorganized into the Queens Science Fiction Club.\nFrederik Pohl, in his autobiography \"The Way the Future Was\", said that the origin of the Futurians lay with the Science Fiction League founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1934, the local New York City chapter of which was called the \"Brooklyn Science Fiction League\" or BSFL, headed by G. G. Clark.\nWollheim, John Michel, and Robert A. W. Lowndes were also members of the BSFL. Along with Pohl, the four started calling themselves the \"Quadrumvirate\". Pohl, commenting about that time, said \"we four marched from Brooklyn to the sea, leaving a wide scar of burned out clubs behind us. We changed clubs the way Detroit changes tailfins, every year had a new one, and last year's was junk\".\nThere were several club names during that period, before finally settling on the Futurians. In 1935 there was the \"East New York Science Fiction League\" (ENYSFL), later the \"Independent League for Science Fiction\" (ILSF). In 1936 came the International Cosmos Science Club (ICSC), which also involved Will Sykora. Pohl then says that \"on reflection 'Cosmos' seemed to take in a bit more territory than was justified, so we changed it to the International Scientific Association (it wasn't International either, but then it also wasn't scientific)\". The ISA then was renamed New York Branch-International Scientific Association (NYB-ISA).\nIn 1937, after a falling-out with Will Sykora and others, the \"Quadrumvirate\" went on to found the Futurians. Sykora then founded the Queens Science Fiction League with Sam Moskowitz and James V. Taurasi. Later, the QSFL changed into New Fandom. Pohl said the New Fandom and the Futurians were \"Addicted to Feuds\", that \"No CIA nor KGB ever wrestled so valiantly for the soul of an emerging nation as New Fandom and the Futurians did for science fiction\".\nMost of the group's members also had professional ambitions within science fiction and related fields, and collectively were very effective at achieving this goal, as the roster of members suggests. At one point in the earliest 1940s, approximately half of all the pulp SF and fantasy magazines in the U.S. were being edited by Futurians: Frederik Pohl at the Popular Publications offshoot Fictioneers, Inc. (\"Astonishing Stories\" and \"Super-Science Stories\"); Robert Lowndes at Columbia Publications, most notably with \"Science Fiction\" and \"Future Fiction\" (though through the decade to come, Lowndes's responsibilities would expand to other types of fiction magazine in the chain), and Donald Wollheim at the very marginal Albing Publications with the short-lived, micro-budgeted \"Cosmic Stories\" and \"Stirring Science Stories\" (Wollheim soon moved on to Avon Books; Do\u00eb \"Leslie Perri\" Baumgardt also worked on a romance fiction title for Albing). Most of these projects had small editorial budgets, and relied in part, or occasionally entirely, on contributions from fellow Futurians for their contents.\nPolitical tendencies.\nAt the time the Futurians were formed, Donald Wollheim was strongly attracted by communism and believed that followers of science fiction \"should actively work for the realization of the scientific world-state as the only genuine justification for their activities and existence\". It was to this end that Wollheim formed the Futurians, and many of its members were in some degree interested in the political applications of science fiction. Members of the Futurians, including Wollheim, Michel, Lowndes, and Cohen briefly became interested in Technocracy, a utopian movement led by Howard Scott, and attended a study course, although they later dismissed Scott as a \"crackpot\".\nHence the group included supporters of Trotskyism, like Judith Merril and others who would have been deemed far left for the era (Frederik Pohl became a member of the Communist Party in 1936, but later quit in 1939).\nPohl, in his autobiography, \"The Way the Future Was\", said Wollheim voted for Republican Presidential Candidate Alfred Landon in 1936."}

{"id": "11536", "revid": "1013150671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11536", "title": "Fianna F\u00e1il", "text": "Fianna F\u00e1il (, ; meaning 'Soldiers of Destiny' or 'Warriors of F\u00e1l'), officially Fianna F\u00e1il\u00a0\u2013 The Republican Party (), is a progressive, centrist and Irish nationalist political party in Ireland.\nThe party was founded as an Irish republican party on 16 May 1926 by \u00c9amon de Valera and his supporters after they split from Sinn F\u00e9in in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War on the issue of abstentionism on taking the Oath of Allegiance to the British Monarchy, which De Valera advocated in order to keep his position as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) in the Irish parliament, in contrast to his position before the Irish Civil War. Since 1927, Fianna F\u00e1il has been one of Ireland's two major parties, along with Fine Gael since 1933; both are seen as being centre-right parties, and as being to the right of the Labour Party and Sinn F\u00e9in. The party dominated Irish political life for most of the 20th century, and, since its foundation, either it or Fine Gael has led every government. Between 1932 and 2011, it was the largest party in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, but latterly with a decline in its vote share; from 1989 onwards, its periods of government were in coalition with parties of either the left or the right.\nFianna F\u00e1il's vote collapsed in the 2011 general election; it emerged in third place, in what was widely seen as a political realignment in the wake of the post-2008 Irish economic downturn. By 2016, it had recovered enough to become the largest opposition party, and it entered a confidence and supply arrangement with a Fine Gael-led minority government. In 2020, after a number of months of political stalemate following the general election, Fianna F\u00e1il agreed with Fine Gael and the Green Party to enter into an unprecedented coalition, with the leaders of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael rotating between the roles of Taoiseach and T\u00e1naiste.\nFianna F\u00e1il is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and of Liberal International. Since 9 February 2019, Fianna F\u00e1il has been in partnership with the Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland.\nHistory.\nFianna F\u00e1il was founded by \u00c9amon de Valera, a former leader of Sinn F\u00e9in. He and a number of other members split from Sinn F\u00e9in when a motion he proposed\u2014which called for elected members to be allowed to take their seats in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann if and when the controversial Oath of Allegiance was removed\u2014failed to pass at the Sinn F\u00e9in Ard Fheis in 1926. His new party adopted its name on 2 April of the same year. While it was also opposed to the Treaty settlement, it rejected abstentionism, instead aiming to republicanise the Irish Free State from within. Fianna F\u00e1il's platform of economic autarky had appeal among the farmers, working-class people and the poor, while alienating more affluent classes.\nThe party first entered government on 9 March 1932. It was in power for 61 of the 79 years between then and the election of 2011. Its longest continuous period in office has been 15 years and 11 months (March 1932\u00a0\u2013 February 1948). Its longest single period out of office in the 20th century was four years and four months (March 1973\u00a0\u2013 July 1977). All of the party's leaders have served as Taoiseach.\nFianna F\u00e1il joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) party on 16 April 2009, and the party's Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) sat in the ALDE Group during the 7th European Parliament term from June 2009 to 1 July 2014. The party is a full member of the Liberal International. Prior to this, the party was part of the Eurosceptic Union for Europe of the Nations parliamentary group between 1999 and 2009.\nIt was the largest party in the D\u00e1il after every general election from that of 1932 until that of 2007. During the post-2008 Irish economic downturn, for which Fianna F\u00e1il as governing party was seen to be responsible, its popularity crashed: an opinion poll on 27 February 2009 indicated that only 10% of voters were satisfied with the Government's performance. In the 2011 general election, it suffered the worst defeat of a sitting government in the history of the Irish state. This loss was described as \"historic\" in its proportions and \"unthinkable\". The party sank from being the largest in the D\u00e1il to the third-largest, losing 58 of its 78 seats.\nOrganisation and structure.\nFianna F\u00e1il uses a structure called a cumann system. The basic unit was the \"cumann\" (branch); these were grouped into \"comhairle ceantair\" (district branch) and a \"comhairle d\u00e1il ceantair\" (constituency branch) in every constituency. At the party's height it had 3,000 \"cumainn\", an average of 75 per constituency. The party claimed that in 2005 they had 50,000 registered names, but only an estimated 10,000-15,000 members were considered active.\nHowever, from the early 1990s onward the \"cumann\" structure was weakened. Every \"cumann\" was entitled to three votes to selection conventions irrespective of its size; hence, a large number of \"cumainn\" had become in effect \"paper \"cumainn\"\", the only use of which was to ensure an aspiring or sitting candidate got enough votes. Another problem had arisen with the emergence of parallel organisations grouped around candidates or elected officials. Supporters and election workers for a particular candidate were loyal to a candidate and not to the party. If the candidate were to leave the party, through either resignation, retirement or defeat at an election, the candidate's supporters would often depart. Although this phenomenon was nothing new (the most famous example being Neil Blaney's \"Donegal Mafia\") it increased significantly from the early 1990s, particularly in the Dublin Region with former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's \"Drumcondra mafia\" and the groups supporting Tom Kitt and S\u00e9amus Brennan in Dublin South that were largely separate from the official party structure.\nSince the 2007 election, the party's structure has significantly weakened. This was in part exacerbated by significant infighting between candidates in the run-up to the 2011 general election. \"The Irish Times\" estimated that half of its 3,000 \"cumainn\" were effectively moribund. This fraction rose in Dublin with the exception of Dublin West, the former seat of both Brian Lenihan Snr and Brian Lenihan Jnr.\nIdeology.\nFianna F\u00e1il is seen as a typical catch-all party. R. Ken Carty wrote of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael that they were \"heterogeneous in their bases of support, relatively undifferentiated in terms of policy or programme, and remarkably stable in their support levels\". Evidence from expert surveys, opinion polls and candidate surveys all fail to identify strong distinctions between the two parties. Many point to Ireland's Civil War politics, and feel that the basis for the division is the disagreement about the strategy to achieve a united Ireland. Kevin Byrne and political scientist Eoin O'Malley rejected this, and have argued that the differences between the two parties goes much further back in Irish history. They linked the parties to different nationalist traditions (Irish Enlightenment and Gaelic Nationalist) which in turn could be linked to migrations of Anglo-Norman and new English into Ireland and the native Gaelic population.\nIn the 1990s, Fianna F\u00e1il was described as a conservative party but also as a nationalist party. It has presented itself as a \"broad church\" and attracted support from across disparate social classes. Between 1989 and 2011, it led coalition governments with parties of both the left and the right. Fianna F\u00e1il's platform contains a number of enduring commitments: to Irish unity; to the promotion and protection of the Irish language; and to maintaining Ireland's tradition of military neutrality. While the party is distinctly more populist, nationalist and, generally speaking, more economically interventionist than Fine Gael, the party nonetheless shares its rival's support of the European Union. Although part of the ALDE (liberal) group in the European Parliament, the party has not supported the group's positions on civil liberties. Thus, the liberal nature of the party is disputed. It did, however, legislate for same-sex civil partnerships in 2010.\nThe party's name and logo incorporates the words 'The Republican Party'. According to Fianna F\u00e1il, \"Republican here stands both for the unity of the island and a commitment to the historic principles of European republican philosophy, namely liberty, equality and fraternity\". The party's main goal at its beginning was to reunite the North and the South.\nLeadership and president.\nThe posts of leader and party president of Fianna F\u00e1il are separate, with the former elected by the Parliamentary Party and the latter elected by the Ardfheis (thus allowing for the posts to be held by different people, in theory). However, in practice they have always been held by the one person. As the Ardfheis may have already been held in any given year by the time a new leader is elected, the selection of the new party president might not take place until the next year.\nThe following are the terms of office as party leader and as Taoiseach:\n\u00d3gra Fianna F\u00e1il.\nFianna F\u00e1il's youth wing is called \u00d3gra Fianna F\u00e1il. Formed in 1975, it plays an active role in recruiting new members and supporting election campaigns. \u00d3gra also plays an important role in the party organisation, where it has five representatives on the Ard Chomhairle (National Executive).\nSenator Thomas Byrne was the last nominated head or Cathaoirleach (Chairperson) of \u00d3gra Fianna F\u00e1il, before the youth wing introduced widespread organisational reform following the heavy electoral defeat suffered by the whole party in 2011.\nFianna F\u00e1il and Northern Ireland politics.\nOn 17 September 2007, Fianna F\u00e1il announced that the party would for the first time organise in Northern Ireland. The then Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern was asked to chair a committee on the matter: \"In the period ahead Dermot Ahern will lead efforts to develop that strategy for carrying through this policy, examining timescales and structures. We will act gradually and strategically. We are under no illusions. It will not be easy. It will challenge us all. But I am confident we will succeed\".\nThe party embarked on its first ever recruitment drive north of the border in September 2007 in northern universities, and established two 'Political Societies', the William Drennan Cumann in Queens University, Belfast, and the Watty Graham Cumann in UU Magee, Derry, which subsequently became official units of Fianna F\u00e1il's youth wing, attaining full membership and voting rights, and attained official voting delegates at the 2012 \u00c1rd Fheis. On 23 February 2008, it was announced that a former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) councillor, Colonel Harvey Bicker, had joined Fianna F\u00e1il.\nBertie Ahern announced on 7 December 2007 that Fianna F\u00e1il had been registered in Northern Ireland by the UK Electoral Commission.\nThe party's Ard Fheis in 2009 unanimously passed a motion to organise in Northern Ireland by establishing forums, rather than cumainn, in each of its six counties. In December 2009, Fianna F\u00e1il secured its first Northern Ireland Assembly MLA when Gerry McHugh, an independent MLA, announced he had joined the party. Mr. McHugh confirmed that although he had joined the party, he would continue to sit as an independent MLA. In June 2010, Fianna F\u00e1il opened its first official office in Northern Ireland, in Crossmaglen, County Armagh. The then Taoiseach Brian Cowen officially opened the office, accompanied by Ministers \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv and Dermot Ahern and Deputies Rory O\u2019Hanlon and Margaret Conlon. Discussing the party's slow development towards all-Ireland politics, Mr. Cowen observed: \"We have a very open and pragmatic approach. We are a constitutional republican party and we make no secret of the aspirations on which this party was founded. It has always been very clear in our mind what it is we are seeking to achieve, that is to reconcile this country and not being prisoners of our past history. To be part of a generation that will build a new Ireland, an Ireland of which we can all be proud\".\nAs of 2007, Fianna F\u00e1il has been a registered and recognised party in Northern Ireland. However, it has not contested any elections in the region. At the party's 2014 Ard Fheis, a motion was passed without debate to stand candidates for election north of the border for the first time in 2019.\nIn 2017, Omagh councillor Sorcha McAnespy said she wished to run in the 2019 Northern Ireland local government election in the constituency under a Fianna F\u00e1il ticket. In October 2017 she was elected as northern representative on the party's national executive, the \"committee of 15\".\nSince 24 January 2019, the party have been in partnership with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) formerly the main Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland, but now smaller than Sinn F\u00e9in. There had long been speculation about the eventual partnership for several years prior. This was initially met with a negative reaction from Seamus Mallon, former Deputy Leader of the SDLP, who stated he would be opposed to any such merger. Former leader of the SDLP Margaret Ritchie originally stated publicly that she opposed any merger, announcing to the Labour Party Conference that such a merger would not happen on her \"watch\". On 10 January 2019, Richie stated that she now supported a new partnership with Fianna F\u00e1il.\nBoth Fianna F\u00e1il and the SDLP currently have shared policies on key areas including addressing the current political situation in Northern Ireland, improving public services in both jurisdictions of Ireland, such as healthcare and education, and bringing about the further unity and cooperation of the people on the island and arrangements for a future poll on Irish reunification.\nIn European institutions.\nIn the European Parliament from 1999 to 2009, Fianna F\u00e1il was a leading member of Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN), a small national-conservative and Eurosceptic parliamentary group. European political commentators had often noted substantive ideological differences between the party and its colleagues, whose strongly conservative stances had at times prompted domestic criticism of Fianna F\u00e1il. Fianna F\u00e1il MEPs had been an attached to the European Progressive Democrats (1973\u20131984), European Democratic Alliance (1984\u20131995), and Union for Europe (1995\u20131999) groups before the creation of UEN.\nParty headquarters, over the objections of some MEPs, had made several attempts to sever the party's links to the European right, including an aborted 2004 agreement to join the European Liberal Democrat and Reform (ELDR) Party, with whom it already sat in the Council of Europe under the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) banner. On 27 February 2009, Taoiseach Brian Cowen announced that Fianna F\u00e1il proposed to join the ELDR Party and intended to sit with them in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Group in the European Parliament after the 2009 European elections. The change was made official on 17 April 2009, when FF joined the ELDR Party.\nIn October 2009, it was reported that Fianna F\u00e1il had irritated its new Liberal colleagues by failing to vote for the motion on press freedom in Italy (resulting in its defeat by a majority of one in the Parliament) and by trying to scupper their party colleagues' initiative for gay rights. In January 2010, a report by academic experts writing for the votewatch.eu site found that FF \"do not seem to toe the political line\" of the ALDE Group \"when it comes to budget and civil liberties\" issues.\nIn the 2014 European elections, Fianna F\u00e1il received 22.3% of first-preference votes but only returned a single MEP, a reduction in representation of two MEPs from the previous term. This was due to a combination of the party's vote further dropping in Dublin and a two candidate strategy in the Midlands North West constituency, which backfired, resulting in sitting MEP Pat \"the Cope\" Gallagher losing his seat. On 23 June 2014, returning MEP Brian Crowley announced that he intended to sit with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) rather than the ALDE group during the upcoming 8th term of the European parliament. The following day on 24 June 2014 Crowley had the Fianna F\u00e1il party whip withdrawn. He has since been re-added to Fianna F\u00e1il's website.\nIn the European Committee of the Regions, Fianna F\u00e1il sits in the Renew Europe CoR group, with two full and two alternate members for the 2020\u20132025 mandate."}

{"id": "11539", "revid": "2139896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11539", "title": "Fujiwara clan", "text": ", also shortened to , descending from the Nakatomi clan and through them Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto, was a powerful family of regents in Japan. The 8th century clan history \"T\u014dshi Kaden\" (\u85e4\u6c0f\u5bb6\u4f1d) states the following at the biography of the clan's patriarch, Nakatomi no Kamatari (614\u2013669): \"Kamatari, the Inner Palace Minister who was also called \u2018Ch\u016br\u014d\",\"\u2019 was a man of the Takechi district of Yamato Province. His forebears descended from Ame no Koyane no Mikoto; for generations they had administered the rites for Heaven and Earth, harmonizing the space between men and the gods. Therefore it was ordered their clan was to be called \u014cnakatomi\"\nThe clan originated when the founder, Nakatomi no Kamatari (614\u2013669) of the Nakatomi clan, was rewarded by Emperor Tenji with the honorific \"Fujiwara\", which evolved as a surname for Kamatari and his descendants. In time, Fujiwara became known as a clan name.\nThe Fujiwara dominated the Japanese politics of Heian period (794\u20131185) through the monopoly of regent positions, \"sessh\u014d\" and \"kampaku\". The family's primary strategy for central influence was through the marrying of Fujiwara daughters to emperors. Through this, the Fujiwara would gain influence over the next emperor who would, according to family tradition of that time, be raised in the household of his mother's side and owe loyalty to his grandfather.\nAs abdicated emperors took over power by exercising \"insei\" (, cloistered rule) at the end of the 11th century, then followed by the rise of the warrior class, the Fujiwara gradually lost its control over mainstream politics.\nThe Northern Fujiwara (\u014csh\u016b Fujiwara) ruled the T\u014dhoku region (northeast Honsh\u016b) of Japan during the 12th century.\nBeyond the 12th century, they continued to monopolize the titles of \"sessh\u014d\" and \"kampaku\" for much of the time until the system was abolished in the Meiji era. Though their influence declined, the clan remained close advisors to the succeeding Emperors.\nAsuka/Nara period.\nThe Fujiwara clan's political influence was initiated during the Asuka period. Nakatomi no Kamatari, a member of the lower-nobility Nakatomi family led a coup against the Soga in 645 and initiated a series of sweeping government reforms that would be known as the Taika Reform. In 668 Emperor Tenji (reigned 668\u2013671), bestowed the \"kabane\" on Kamatari. The surname passed to the descendants of Fujiwara no Fuhito (659\u2013720), the second son and heir of Kamatari, who was prominent at the court of several emperors and empresses during the early Nara period. He made his daughter Miyako a concubine of Emperor Monmu. Her son, Prince Obito became Emperor Sh\u014dmu. Fuhito succeeded in making another of his daughters, K\u014dmy\u014dshi, the empress consort of Emperor Sh\u014dmu. She was the first empress consort of Japan who was not a daughter of the imperial family itself. Fuhito had four sons; and each of them became the progenitor of a cadet branch of the clan: \nAmong them, the Hokke came to be considered as the leaders of the entire clan. All four brothers died in 737 during a major smallpox epidemic in Japan.\nHeian period.\nDuring the Heian period of Japanese history, the Hokke managed to establish a hereditary claim to the position of regent, either for an underage emperor (\"sessh\u014d\") or for an adult one (\"kampaku\"). Some prominent Fujiwaras occupied these positions more than once, and for more than one emperor. Lesser members of the Fujiwara were court nobles, provincial governors and vice governors, members of the provincial aristocracy, and samurai. The Fujiwara was one of the four great families that dominated Japanese politics during the Heian Period (794\u20131185), and the most important of them at that time. The others were the Tachibana, the Taira and the Minamoto. The Fujiwara exercised tremendous power, especially during the period of regency governments in 10th and 11th centuries, having many emperors as practically puppet monarchs.\nThe Fujiwara dominated the government of Japan 794\u20131160. There is no clear starting point of their dominance. However, their domination of civil administration was lost by the establishment of the first shogunate (i.e., Kamakura shogunate) under Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1192.\nFujiwara princes initially served as highest ministers of the imperial Court (\"kampaku\") and regents (\"sessh\u014d\") for underage monarchs. The Fujiwara were the proverbial \"power behind the throne\" for centuries. Apparently they never aspired to supplant the imperial dynasty. Instead, the clan's influence stemmed from its matrimonial alliances with the imperial family. Because consorts of crown princes, younger sons, and emperors were generally Fujiwara women, the male heads of the Fujiwara house were often the father-in-law, brother-in-law, uncle, or maternal grandfather of the emperor. The family reached the peak of its power under Fujiwara no Michinaga (966\u20131027). He was the grandfather of three emperors, the father of six empresses or imperial consorts, and the grandfather of seven additional imperial consorts; it is no exaggeration to say that it was Michinaga who ruled Japan during this period, not the titular Emperors. As a result of these unusually strong familial links, Michinaga never took the title of Kampaku - he held more than the power that the position would bring, and had no need of the title.\nThe Fujiwara clan is featured prominently in \"The Pillow Book\", by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, and the character of Genji is partially based on Michinaga in the eponymous the Tale of Genji.\nFujiwara regime in the Heian period.\nThe Fujiwara Regency was the main feature of government during most of the Heian era. Kyoto (Heian-ky\u014d) was geopolitically a better seat of government; with good river access to the sea, it could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces.\nJust before the move to the Heian-ky\u014d, the Emperor had abolished universal conscription in the eighth century and soon local, private militaries came into being. The Fujiwara and the clans of Taira and Minamoto created later during the ninth century were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class.\nIn the ninth and tenth centuries, much authority was lost to the great families, who disregarded the Chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in Kyoto. Stability came to Heian Japan, but, even though succession was ensured for the Imperial family through heredity, power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family, the Fujiwara.\nFamily administrations now became public institutions. As the most powerful family, the Fujiwara governed Japan and determined the general affairs of state, such as succession to the throne. Family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed, a pattern followed among other families, monasteries, and even the imperial family.\nAs the Soga had taken control of the throne in the sixth century, the Fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family, and one of their members was the first head of the Emperor's Private Office. While the earliest parts of the Heian period was marked by unusually strong emperors governing themselves (in particular from Emperor Kanmu to Emperor Saga (781-823)), the Fujiwara started to rebuild their influence first under Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu in the first half of the ninth century. Fuyutsugu's son Fujiwara no Yoshifusa was the first person not from the imperial family to become regent for a minor emperor when he gained that position when his grandson was enthroned as Emperor Seiwa in 858. His adopted son, Fujiwara no Mototsune, had himself further appointed \"kampaku\" (regent for an adult emperor, a newly invented position). After Mototsune's death Emperor Uda (who was not the son of a Fujiwara daughter) managed to regain control of much of government. However, after abdicating in favour of his son, Emperor Daigo (897\u2013930), while apparently intending to control government from retirement, Mototsune's son Fujiwara no Tokihira managed to maneuver himself back to very prominent position until his early death in 909. The remaining period of Daigo's reign was again relatively free from Fujiwara dominance, but from the beginning of the reign of his son Emperor Suzaku, the Fujiwara again re-established their dominance of the court with the leadership of Fujiwara no Tadahira.\nNevertheless, the Fujiwara were not demoted by Emperor Daigo but in many ways became stronger during his reign. Central control of Japan had continued to decline, and the Fujiwara, along with other great families and religious foundations, acquired ever larger \"sh\u014den\" and greater wealth during the early tenth century. By the early Heian period, the \"sh\u014den\" had obtained legal status, and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity, waiver of taxes, and immunity from government inspection of the \"sh\u014den\" they held. Those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to sh\u014den holders in return for a share of the harvest. People and lands were increasingly beyond central control and taxation, a de facto return to conditions before the Taika Reform.\nWithin decades of Emperor Daigo's death, the Fujiwara had absolute control over the court. By the year 1000, Fujiwara no Michinaga was able to enthrone and dethrone emperors at will. Little authority was left for traditional officialdom, and government affairs were handled through the Fujiwara family's private administration. The Fujiwara had become what historian George B. Sansom has called \"hereditary dictators\".\nThe Fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy. There was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature. Japanese writing had long depended on Chinese ideograms (\"kanji\"), but these were now supplemented by \"kana\", two types of phonetic Japanese script: \"katakana\", a mnemonic device using parts of Chinese ideograms; and \"hiragana\", a cursive form of \"kanji\" writing and an art form in itself. \"Hiragana\" gave written expression to the spoken word and, with it, to the rise in Japan's famous vernacular literature, much of it written by court women who had not been trained in Chinese as had their male counterparts. Three late tenth century and early eleventh century women presented their views of life and romance at the Heian court in \"Kager\u014d Nikki\" (\"The Gossamer Years\") by \"the mother of Michitsuna\", \"Makura no S\u014dshi\" (\"The Pillow Book\") by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, and \"Genji Monogatari\" (\"Tale of Genji\") by Murasaki Shikibu (herself a Fujiwara). Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms. Vividly colored \"yamato-e\" (Japanese style) paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid and late Heian periods, setting patterns for Japanese art to this day.\nDecline in food production, growth of the population, and competition for resources among the great families all led to the gradual decline of Fujiwara power and gave rise to military disturbances in the mid-tenth and eleventh centuries. Members of the Fujiwara, Taira, and Minamoto families\u2014all of whom had descended from the imperial family\u2014attacked one another, claimed control over vast tracts of conquered land, set up rival regimes, and generally broke the peace of Japan.\nThe Fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d (1068\u201373), the first emperor not born of a Fujiwara mother since the ninth century. Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d, determined to restore imperial control through strong personal rule, implemented reforms to curb Fujiwara influence. He also established an office to compile and validate estate records with the aim of reasserting central control. Many \"sh\u014den\" were not properly certified, and large landholders, like the Fujiwara, felt threatened with the loss of their lands. Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d also established the \"In no ch\u014d\", or Office of the Cloistered Emperor, which was held by a succession of emperors who abdicated to devote themselves to behind-the-scenes governance, or \"insei\" (Cloistered rule).\nThe \"In no ch\u014d\" filled the void left by the decline of Fujiwara power. Rather than being banished, the Fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making. In time, many of the Fujiwara were replaced, mostly by members of the rising Minamoto family. While the Fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions, the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne. The period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the \"In no ch\u014d\" and of the rise of the military class throughout the country. Military might rather than civil authority dominated the government.\nA struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the Fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power. Fujiwara no Yorinaga sided with the retired emperor in a violent battle in 1158 against the heir apparent, who was supported by the Taira and Minamoto. In the end, the Fujiwara were destroyed, the old system of government supplanted, and the \"insei\" system left powerless as bushi took control of court affairs, marking a turning point in Japanese history. Within a year, the Taira and Minamoto clashed, and a twenty-year period of Taira ascendancy began. The Taira were seduced by court life and ignored problems in the provinces. Finally, Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147\u201399) rose from his headquarters at Kamakura (in the Kant\u014d region, southwest of modern Tokyo) to defeat the Taira, and with them the child emperor Emperor Antoku they controlled, in the Genpei War (1180\u201385).\nAfter this downfall, the younger branches of the Fujiwara clan turned their focus from politics to the arts, producing literary scholars including Fujiwara no Shunzei and Fujiwara no Teika.\nDecline.\nOnly forty years after Michinaga's death, his Fujiwara heirs were not able to prevent the accession of Emperor Go-Sanj\u014d (reigned 1068\u201373), the first emperor since Emperor Uda whose mother was not a Fujiwara. The system of government by retired emperor (\"daij\u014d tenn\u014d\") (cloistered rule) beginning from 1087 further weakened the Fujiwara's control over the Imperial Court.\nThe Fujiwara-dominated Heian period approached its end along disturbances of 12th century. The dynastic struggle known as the H\u014dgen Disturbance (\"H\u014dgen no Ran\") led to the Taira emerging as the most powerful clan in 1156. During the Heiji Disturbance (\"Heiji no Ran\") in 1160 the Taira defeated the coalition of Fujiwara and Minamoto forces. This defeat marked the end of the Fujiwara's dominance.\nSplit and enduring influence.\nDuring the 13th century, the Hokke Fujiwara (\"Hokke\"), was split into five regent houses: Konoe, Takatsukasa, Kuj\u014d, Nij\u014d and Ichij\u014d.\nThey had a \"monopoly\" to the offices of \"sessh\u014d\" and \"kampaku\", and served in turn. The political power had shifted away from the court nobility in Kyoto to the new warrior class in the countryside. However, Fujiwara remained close advisers, regents and ministers to the emperors for centuries, the family remained and political reputation and influence even until the 20th century (such as Fumimaro Konoe and Morihiro Hosokawa, who became the Prime Ministers). As such, they had a certain political power and much influence, as often the rival warriors and later bakufu sought their alliance. Oda Nobunaga and his sister Oichi claimed to have descent from the Taira and Fujiwara clans; regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi and shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu were related by marriage to various families from Fujiwara clan. Empress Sh\u014dken, wife of Emperor Meiji, was a descendant of the Fujiwara clan.\nUntil the marriage of the Crown Prince Hirohito (Emperor Sh\u014dwa) to Princess Nagako of Kuni (posthumously Empress K\u014djun) in January 1924, the principal consorts of emperors and crown princes had often been recruited from one of the Sekke Fujiwara. Imperial princesses were often married to Fujiwara lords \u2013 throughout a millennium at least. As recently as Emperor Sh\u014dwa's third daughter, the former Princesss Kazuko and Prince Mikasa's elder daughter, the former Princess Yasuko, married into Takatsukasa and Konoe families, respectively. Likewise a daughter of the last \"sh\u014dgun\" married a second cousin of Emperor Sh\u014dwa."}

{"id": "11542", "revid": "28033391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11542", "title": "Federalism", "text": "Federalism is a mixed or compound mode of government that combines a general government (the central or \"federal\" government) with regional governments (provincial, state, cantonal, territorial or other sub-unit governments) in a single political system. Its distinctive feature, first embodied in the Constitution of the United States of 1789, is a relationship of \"parity\" between the two levels of government established. It can thus be defined as a form of government in which powers are divided between two levels of government of equal status.\nFederalism differs from confederalism, in which the general level of government is subordinate to the regional level, and from devolution within a unitary state, in which the regional level of government is subordinate to the general level. It represents the central form in the pathway of regional integration or separation, bounded on the less integrated side by confederalism and on the more integrated side by devolution within a unitary state.\nExamples of the federation or federal state include the United States, India, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, Argentina, Nigeria, and Australia. Some characterize the European Union as the pioneering example of federalism in a multi-state setting, in a concept termed the federal union of states.\nOverview.\nThe terms \"federalism\" and \"confederalism\" share a root in the Latin word \"foedus\", meaning \"treaty, pact or covenant\". Their common early meaning until the late eighteenth century was a simple league or inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based on a treaty. They were therefore initially synonyms. It was in this sense that James Madison in \"Federalist 39\" had referred to the new US Constitution as \"neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both\" (i.e. as constituting neither a single large unitary state nor a league/confederation among several small states, but a hybrid of the two). In the course of the nineteenth century the meaning of federalism would come to shift, strengthening to refer uniquely to the novel compound political form established at Philadelphia, while the meaning of confederalism would remain at a league of states. Thus, this article relates to the modern usage of the word \"federalism\".\nModern federalism is a political system based upon democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments. The term \"federalist\" describes several political beliefs around the world depending on context. Since the term \"federalization\" also describes distinctive political processes, its use as well depends on the context.\nIn political theory, two main types of federalization are recognized:\nFederalism is sometimes viewed in the context of international negotiation as \"the best system for integrating diverse nations, ethnic groups, or combatant parties, all of whom may have cause to fear control by an overly powerful center.\" However, in some countries, those skeptical of federal prescriptions believe that increased regional autonomy is likely to lead to secession or dissolution of the nation. In Syria, federalization proposals have failed in part because \"Syrians fear that these borders could turn out to be the same as the ones that the fighting parties have currently carved out.\"\nFederations such as Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia collapsed as soon as it was possible to put the model to the test.\nEarly origins.\nAn early historical example of federalism is the Achaean League in Hellenistic Greece. Unlike the Greek city states of Classical Greece, each of which insisted on keeping its complete independence, changing conditions in the Hellenistic period drove many city states to band together even at the cost of losing part of their sovereignty \u2013 similar to the process leading to the formation of later federations.\nExplanations for adoption.\nAccording to Daniel Ziblatt's \"Structuring the State\", there are four competing theoretical explanations in the academic literature for the adoption of federal systems:\nImmanuel Kant.\nImmanuel Kant was an advocate of federalism, noting that \"the problem of setting up a state can be solved even by a nation of devils\" so long as they possess an appropriate constitution which pits opposing factions against each other with a system of checks and balances. In particular individual states required a federation as a safeguard against the possibility of war.\nEurope vs. the United States.\nIn Europe, \"Federalist\" is sometimes used to describe those who favor a common federal government, with distributed power at regional, national and supranational levels. Most European federalists want this development to continue within the European Union. European federalism originated in post-war Europe; one of the more important initiatives was Winston Churchill's speech in Z\u00fcrich in 1946.\nIn the United States, federalism originally referred to belief in a stronger central government. When the U.S. Constitution was being drafted, the Federalist Party supported a stronger central government, while \"Anti-Federalists\" wanted a weaker central government. This is very different from the modern usage of \"federalism\" in Europe and the United States. The distinction stems from the fact that \"federalism\" is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a confederacy and a unitary state. The U.S. Constitution was written as a reaction to the Articles of Confederation, under which the United States was a loose confederation with a weak central government.\nIn contrast, Europe has a greater history of unitary states than North America, thus European \"federalism\" argues for a weaker central government, relative to a unitary state. The modern American usage of the word is much closer to the European sense. As the power of the Federal government has increased, some people have perceived a much more unitary state than they believe the Founding Fathers intended. Most people politically advocating \"federalism\" in the United States argue in favor of limiting the powers of the federal government, especially the judiciary (see Federalist Society, New Federalism).\nIn Canada, federalism typically implies opposition to sovereigntist movements (most commonly Quebec separatism).\nThe governments of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, and Mexico, among others, are also organized along federalist principles.\nFederalism may encompass as few as two or three internal divisions, as is the case in Belgium or Bosnia and Herzegovina. In general, two extremes of federalism can be distinguished: at one extreme, the strong federal state is almost completely unitary, with few powers reserved for local governments; while at the other extreme, the national government may be a federal state in name only, being a confederation in actuality.\nIn 1999, the Government of Canada established the Forum of Federations as an international network for exchange of best practices among federal and federalizing countries. Headquartered in Ottawa, the Forum of Federations partner governments include Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan and Switzerland.\nAnarchism.\nAnarchists are against the state, but they are not against political organization or \"governance\", so long as it is self-governance utilizing direct democracy. The mode of political organization preferred by anarchists, in general, is federalism or confederalism. However, the anarchist definition of federalism tends to differ from the definition of federalism assumed by pro-state political scientists. The following is a brief description of federalism from section I.5 of \"An Anarchist FAQ\":\nChristian Church.\nFederalism also finds expression in ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church). For example, presbyterian church governance resembles parliamentary republicanism (a form of \"political federalism\") to a large extent. In Presbyterian denominations, the local church is ruled by elected elders, some of which are ministerial. Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to presbyteries and further to a general assembly. Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members. In this governmental structure, each component has some level of sovereignty over itself. As in \"political federalism\", in presbyterian ecclesiology there is shared sovereignty.\nOther ecclesiologies also have significant representational and federalistic components, including the more anarchic congregational ecclesiology, and even in more hierarchical episcopal ecclesiology.\nSome Christians argue that the earliest source of political federalism (or federalism in human institutions; in contrast to theological federalism) is the ecclesiastical federalism found in the Bible. They point to the structure of the early Christian Church as described (and prescribed, as believed by many) in the New Testament. In their arguments, this is particularly demonstrated in the Council of Jerusalem, described in Acts chapter 15, where the Apostles and elders gathered together to govern the Church; the Apostles being representatives of the universal Church, and elders being such for the local church. To this day, elements of federalism can be found in almost every Christian denomination, some more than others.\nConstitutional structure.\nDivision of powers.\nIn a federation, the division of power between federal and regional governments is usually outlined in the constitution. Almost every country allows some degree of regional self-government, in federations the right to self-government of the component states is constitutionally entrenched. Component states often also possess their own constitutions which they may amend as they see fit, although in the event of conflict the federal constitution usually takes precedence.\nIn almost all federations the central government enjoys the powers of foreign policy and national defense as exclusive federal powers. Were this not the case a federation would not be a single sovereign state, per the UN definition. Notably, the states of Germany retain the right to act on their own behalf at an international level, a condition originally granted in exchange for the Kingdom of Bavaria's agreement to join the German Empire in 1871. Beyond this the precise division of power varies from one nation to another. The constitutions of Germany and the United States provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries like Canada and India, state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility. Under the division of powers of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty, powers which are not either exclusively of European competence or shared between EU and state as concurrent powers are retained by the constituent states.\nWhere every component state of a federation possesses the same powers, we are said to find 'symmetric federalism'. Asymmetric federalism exists where states are granted different powers, or some possess greater autonomy than others do. This is often done in recognition of the existence of a distinct culture in a particular region or regions. In Spain, the Basques and Catalans, as well as the Galicians, spearheaded a historic movement to have their national specificity recognized, crystallizing in the \"historical communities\" such as Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. They have more powers than the later expanded arrangement for other Spanish regions, or the Spain of the autonomous communities (called also the \"coffee for everyone\" arrangement), partly to deal with their separate identity and to appease peripheral nationalist leanings, partly out of respect to specific rights they had held earlier in history. However, strictly speaking Spain is not a federation, but a system of asymmetric devolved government within a unitary state.\nIt is common that during the historical evolution of a federation there is a gradual movement of power from the component states to the centre, as the federal government acquires additional powers, sometimes to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The acquisition of new powers by a federal government may occur through formal constitutional amendment or simply through a broadening of the interpretation of a government's existing constitutional powers given by the courts.\nUsually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (\"munic\u00edpios\") with their own legislative council (\"c\u00e2mara de vereadores\") and a mayor (\"prefeito\"), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a \"little constitution\", called \"organic law\" (\"lei org\u00e2nica\"). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (\"municipio libre\", \"free municipality\") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.\nFederations often employ the paradox of being a union of states, while still being states (or having aspects of statehood) in themselves. For example, James Madison (author of the US Constitution) wrote in Federalist Paper No. 39 that the US Constitution \"is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both. In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...\" This stems from the fact that states in the US maintain all sovereignty that they do not yield to the federation by their own consent. This was reaffirmed by the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reserves all powers and rights that are not delegated to the Federal Government as left to the States and to the people.\nBicameralism.\nThe structures of most federal governments incorporate mechanisms to protect the rights of component states. One method, known as 'intrastate federalism', is to directly represent the governments of component states in federal political institutions. Where a federation has a bicameral legislature the upper house is often used to represent the component states while the lower house represents the people of the nation as a whole. A federal upper house may be based on a special scheme of apportionment, as is the case in the senates of the United States and Australia, where each state is represented by an equal number of senators irrespective of the size of its population.\nAlternatively, or in addition to this practice, the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states, as occurred in the United States prior to 1913, or be actual members or delegates of the state governments, as, for example, is the case in the German Bundesrat and in the Council of the European Union. The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.\nIntergovernmental relations.\nIn Canada, the provincial governments represent regional interests and negotiate directly with the central government. A First Ministers conference of the prime minister and the provincial premiers is the \"de facto\" highest political forum in the land, although it is not mentioned in the constitution.\nConstitutional change.\nFederations often have special procedures for amendment of the federal constitution. As well as reflecting the federal structure of the state this may guarantee that the self-governing status of the component states cannot be abolished without their consent. An amendment to the constitution of the United States must be ratified by three-quarters of either the state legislatures, or of constitutional conventions specially elected in each of the states, before it can come into effect. In referendums to amend the constitutions of Australia and Switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole, but also by separate majorities in each of a majority of the states or cantons. In Australia, this latter requirement is known as a \"double majority\".\nSome federal constitutions also provide that certain constitutional amendments cannot occur without the unanimous consent of all states or of a particular state. The US constitution provides that no state may be deprived of equal representation in the senate without its consent. In Australia, if a proposed amendment will specifically impact one or more states, then it must be endorsed in the referendum held in each of those states. Any amendment to the Canadian constitution that would modify the role of the monarchy would require unanimous consent of the provinces. The German Basic Law provides that no amendment is admissible at all that would abolish the federal system.\nPolitical philosophy.\nThe meaning of \"federalism\", as a political movement, and of what constitutes a 'federalist', varies with country and historical context. Movements associated with the establishment or development of federations can exhibit either centralising or decentralising trends. For example, at the time those nations were being established, factions known as \"federalists\" in the United States and Australia advocated the formation of strong central government. Similarly, in European Union politics, federalists mostly seek greater EU integration. In contrast, in Spain and in post-war Germany, federal movements have sought decentralisation: the transfer of power from central authorities to local units. In Canada, where Quebec separatism has been a political force for several decades, the \"federalist\" impulse aims to keep Quebec inside Canada.\nConflict reducing device.\nFederalism, and other forms of territorial autonomy, is generally seen as a useful way to structure political systems in order to prevent violence among different groups within countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level. Some scholars have suggested, however, that federalism can divide countries and result in state collapse because it creates proto-states. Still others have shown that federalism is only divisive when it lacks mechanisms that encourage political parties to compete across regional boundaries."}

Abauzit is also notable for proofreading or correcting the writings of Isaac Newton and other scholars.\nBiography.\nFirmin Abauzit was born of Huguenot parents November 11, 1679 at Uz\u00e8s, in Languedoc. His paternal family traces its origin to an Arab physician who settled in Toulouse during the 9th century. Accordingly, the name \u201cAbauzit\u201d is liked derived from the Arabic \u201cAbu Zaid\u201d (father of Zaid).\nHis father died when he was but two years of age; and when, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the authorities took steps to have him educated in the Roman Catholic faith, his mother contrived his escape.\nFor two years his brother and he lived as fugitives in the mountains of the C\u00e9vennes, but they at last reached Geneva, where their mother afterwards joined them on escaping from the imprisonment in which she was held from the time of their flight. Abauzit at an early age acquired great proficiency in languages, physics, and theology.\nIn 1698, he traveled to Germany, then to Holland, where he became acquainted with Pierre Bayle, Pierre Jurieu and Jacques Basnage. Proceeding to England, he was introduced to Sir Isaac Newton, who found in him one of the earliest defenders, against Castel of his discoveries. Newton corrected in the second edition of his \"Principia\" an error pointed out by Abauzit, and, when sending him the \"Commercium Epistolicum,\" said, \"You are well worthy to judge between Gottfried Leibniz and me.\"\nThe reputation of Abauzit induced William III to request him to settle in England, but he did not accept the king's offer, preferring to return to Geneva.\nThere, from 1715 he rendered valuable assistance to a society that had been formed for translating the New Testament into French. He declined the offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Geneva in 1723. He assisted in the French language New Testament in 1726. In 1727, he was granted citizenship in Geneva, and he accepted the office of honorary librarian to Geneva, the city of his adoption. It was while he was in Geneva in his later years that he authored many of his works. Here also was the city of his death past the age of 87, on March 20, 1767.\nLegacy.\nAbauzit was a man of great learning and of wonderful versatility. Whatever chanced to be discussed, it used to be said of Abauzit that he seemed to have made it a subject of particular study. Rousseau, who was jealously sparing of his praises, addressed to him, in his \"Julie, ou la nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse\", a fine panegyric; and when a stranger flatteringly told Voltaire he had come to see a great man, the philosopher asked him if he had seen Abauzit. Among his acquaintances, Abauzit claimed Rousseau, Voltaire, Newton, and Bayle.\nLittle remains of the labours of this intellectual giant, his heirs having, it is said, destroyed the papers that came into their possession, because their own religious opinions were different. A few theological, archaeological, and astronomical articles from his pen appeared in the \"Journal helv\u00e9tique\" and elsewhere, and he contributed several papers to Rousseau's \"Dictionnaire de musique\" (1767). He wrote a work throwing doubt on the canonical authority of the Apocalypse, which called forth a reply from Dr Leonard Twells, and was published in Denis Diderot's \"Encyclop\u00e9die\". He also edited and made valuable additions to Jacob Spon's \"Histoire de la r\u00e9publique de Gen\u00e8ve\". A collection of his writings was published at Geneva in 1770 (\"\u0152uvres de feu M. Abauzit\"), and another at London in 1773 (\"\u0152uvres diverses de M. Abauzit\")."}
{"id": "11544", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11544", "title": "French Foreign Legion", "text": "The French Foreign Legion (FFL; , , \"L.\u00c9.\") is a military service branch of the French Army established in 1831. Legionnaires are highly trained infantry soldiers and the Legion is unique in that it is open to foreign recruits willing to serve in the French Armed Forces. When it was founded, the French Foreign Legion was not unique; other foreign formations existed at the time in France. The Foreign Legion is today known as a unit whose training focuses on traditional military skills and on its strong \"esprit de corps\", as its men come from different countries with different cultures. Consequently, training is often described as not only physically challenging, but also very stressful psychologically. French citizenship may be applied for after three years' service. The Legion is the only part of the French military that does not swear allegiance to France, but to the Foreign Legion itself. Any soldier who gets wounded during a battle for France can immediately apply to be a French citizen under a provision known as \"\" (\"French by spilled blood\"). As of 2018, members came from 140 countries.\nSince 1831, the Legion has consisted of hundreds of thousands in active service at its peak, and suffered the aggregated loss of nearly 40,000 men in France, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Madagascar, West Africa, Mexico, Italy, the Crimea, Spain, Indo-China, Norway, Syria, Chad, Za\u00efre, Lebanon, Central Africa, Gabon, Kuwait, Rwanda, Djibouti, former Yugoslavia, Somalia, the Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Afghanistan, Mali, as well as others. The French Foreign Legion was primarily used to help protect and expand the French colonial empire during the 19th century. The Foreign Legion was initially stationed only in Algeria, where it took part in the pacification and development of the colony. Subsequently, the Foreign Legion was deployed in a number of conflicts, including the First Carlist War in 1835, the Crimean War in 1854, the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, the French intervention in Mexico in 1863, the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the Tonkin Campaign and Sino-French War in 1883, supporting growth of the French colonial empire in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Second Franco-Dahomean War in 1892, the Second Madagascar expedition in 1895 and the Mandingo Wars in 1894. In World War I, the Foreign Legion fought in many critical battles on the Western Front. It played a smaller role in World War II than in World War I, though having a part in the Norwegian, Syrian and North African campaigns. During the First Indochina War (1946\u20131954), the Foreign Legion saw its numbers swell. The Legion lost a large number of men in the (for them) catastrophic Battle of Dien Bien Phu against forces of the Viet Minh.\nSubsequent military campaigns included those during the Suez Crisis, the Battle of Algiers and various offensives in Algeria launched by General Maurice Challe including Operation Oranie and Operation Jumelles. During the Algerian War of Independence (1954\u20131962), the Foreign Legion came close to being disbanded after some officers, men, and the highly decorated 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) took part in the Generals' putsch. In the 1960s and 1970s, Legion regiments had additional roles in sending units as a rapid deployment force to preserve French interests \u2013 in its former African colonies and in other nations as well; it also returned to its roots of being a unit always ready to be sent to conflict zones around the world. Some notable operations include: the Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict in 1969\u20131972 (the first time that the Legion was sent in operations after the Algerian War), 1978\u20131979, and 1983\u20131987; Kolwezi in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 1978. In 1981, the 1st Foreign Regiment and Foreign Legion regiments took part in the Multinational Force in Lebanon. In 1990, Foreign Legion regiments were sent to the Persian Gulf and participated in Op\u00e9ration Daguet, part of Division Daguet. Following the Gulf War in the 1990s, the Foreign Legion helped with the evacuation of French citizens and foreigners in Rwanda, Gabon and Zaire. The Foreign Legion was also deployed in Cambodia, Somalia, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the mid- to late 1990s, the Foreign Legion was deployed in the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville and in Kosovo. The French Foreign Legion also took part in operations in Rwanda in 1990\u20131994; and the Ivory Coast in 2002 to the present. In the 2000s, the Foreign Legion was deployed in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Operation Licorne in Ivory Coast, the EUFOR Tchad/RCA in Chad, and Operation Serval in the Northern Mali conflict. Other countries have tried to emulate the French Foreign Legion model.\nHistory.\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Louis Philippe, the King of France, on 10 March 1831\nfrom the foreign regiments of the Kingdom of France. Recruits included soldiers from the recently disbanded Swiss and German foreign regiments of the Bourbon monarchy. The Royal Ordinance for the establishment of the new regiment specified that the foreigners recruited could only serve outside France. The French expeditionary force that had occupied Algiers in 1830 was in need of reinforcements and the Legion was accordingly transferred by sea in detachments from Toulon to Algeria.\nThe Foreign Legion was primarily used, as part of the \"Arm\u00e9e d'Afrique\", to protect and expand the French colonial empire during the 19th century, but it also fought in almost all French wars including the Franco-Prussian War, World War I and World War II. The Foreign Legion has remained an important part of the French Army and sea transport protected by the French Navy, surviving three Republics, the Second French Empire, two World Wars, the rise and fall of mass conscript armies, the dismantling of the French colonial empire, and the loss of the Foreign Legion's base, Algeria.\nConquest of Algeria 1830\u20131847.\nCreated to fight \"outside mainland France\", the Foreign Legion was stationed in Algeria, where it took part in the pacification and development of the colony, notably by drying the marshes in the region of Algiers. The Foreign Legion was initially divided into six \"national battalions\" (Swiss, Poles, Germans, Italians, Spanish, and Dutch-Belgian). Smaller national groups, such as the ten Englishmen recorded in December 1832, appear to have been placed randomly.\nIn late 1831, the first legionnaires landed in Algeria, the country that would be the Foreign Legion's homeland for 130 years and shape its character. The early years in Algeria were hard on the legion because it was often sent to the worst postings and received the worst assignments, and its members were generally uninterested in the new colony of the French. The Legion served alongside the Battalions of Light Infantry of Africa, formed in 1832, which was a penal military unit made up of men with prison records who still had to do their military service or soldiers with serious disciplinary problems.\nThe Foreign Legion's first service in Algeria came to an end after only four years, as it was needed elsewhere.\nCarlist War 1835\u20131839.\nTo support Isabella's claim to the Spanish throne against her uncle, the French government decided to send the Foreign Legion to Spain. On 28 June 1835, the unit was handed over to the Spanish government. The Foreign Legion landed via sea at Tarragona on 17 August with around 1,400 who were quickly dubbed \"Los Algerinos\" (the Algerians) by locals because of their previous posting.\nThe Foreign Legion's commander immediately dissolved the national battalions to improve the \"esprit de corps\". Later, he also created three squadrons of lancers and an artillery battery from the existing force to increase independence and flexibility. The Foreign Legion was dissolved on 8 December 1838, when it had dropped to only 500 men. The survivors returned to France, many reenlisting in the new Foreign Legion along with many of their former Carlist enemies.\nCrimean War.\nOn 9 June 1854, the French ship \"Jean Bart\" embarked four battalions of the Foreign Legion for the Crimean Peninsula. A further battalion was stationed at Gallipoli as brigade depot. Eight companies drawn from both regiments of the Foreign Legion took part in the Battle of Alma (20 September 1854). Reinforcements by sea brought the Legion contingent up to brigade strength. As the \"Foreign Brigade\", it served in the Siege of Sevastopol, during the winter of 1854\u20131855.\nThe lack of equipment was particularly challenging and cholera hit the Allied expeditionary force. Nevertheless, the \"leather bellies\" (the nickname given to the legionnaires by the Russians because of the large cartridge pouches that they wore attached to their waist-belts), performed well. On 21 June 1855, the Third Battalion, left Corsica for Crimea.\nOn 8 September the final assault was launched on Sevastopol. Two days later, the Second Foreign Regiment with flags and band playing ahead, marched through the streets of Sevastopol. Although initial reservations had been expressed about whether the Legion should be used outside Africa, the Crimean experience established its suitability for service in European warfare, as well as making a cohesive single entity of what had previously been two separate foreign regiments. Total Legion casualties in the Crimea were 1,703 killed and wounded.\nItalian Campaign 1859.\nLike the rest of the \"Army of Africa\", the Foreign Legion provided detachments in the campaign of Italy. Two foreign regiments, grouped with the 2nd Regiment of Zouaves, were part of the Second Brigade of the Second Division of Mac Mahon's Corps. The Foreign Legion acquitted itself particularly well against the Austrians at the battle of Magenta (4 June 1859) and at the Battle of Solferino (24 June). Legion losses were significant and the 2nd Foreign Regiment lost Colonel Chabri\u00e8re, its commanding officer. In gratitude, the city of Milan awarded, in 1909, the \"commemorative medal of deliverance\", which still adorns the regimental flags of the Second Regiment.\nMexican Expedition 1863\u20131867.\nThe 38,000 strong French expeditionary force dispatched to Mexico via sea between 1862 and 1863 included two battalions of the Foreign Legion, increased to six battalions by 1866. Small cavalry and artillery units were raised from legionnaires serving in Mexico. The original intention was that Foreign Legion units should remain in Mexico for up to six years to provide a core for the Imperial Mexican Army. However the Legion was withdrawn with the other French forces during February\u2013March 1867.\nIt was in Mexico on 30 April 1863 that the Legion earned its legendary status. A company led by Captain Jean Danjou, numbering 62 Legionnaires and 3 Legion officers, was escorting a convoy to the besieged city of Puebla when it was attacked and besieged by three thousand Mexican loyalists, organised in two battalions of infantry and cavalry, numbering 2,200 and 800 respectively. The Legion detachment under Captain Jean Danjou, Sous-Lieutenant , Sous-Lieutenant made a stand in the \"Hacienda de la Trinidad\" \u2013 a farm near the village of \"Camar\u00f3n\". When only six survivors remained, out of ammunition, a bayonet assault was launched in which three of the six were killed. The remaining three wounded men were brought before the Mexican commander Colonel Milan, who allowed them to return to the French lines as an honor guard for the body of Captain Danjou. The captain had a wooden hand, which was later returned to the Legion and is now kept in a case in the Legion Museum at Aubagne, and paraded annually on Camerone Day. It is the Foreign Legion's most precious relic.\nDuring the Mexican Campaign, 6,654 French died. Of these, 1,918 were from a single regiment of the Legion.\nFranco-Prussian War 1870.\nAccording to French law, the Foreign Legion was not to be used within Metropolitan France except in the case of a national invasion, and was consequently not a part of Napoleon III's Imperial Army that capitulated at Sedan. With the defeat of the Imperial Army, the Second French Empire fell and the Third Republic was created.\nThe new Third Republic was desperately short of trained soldiers following Sedan, so the Foreign Legion was ordered to provide a contingent. On 11 October 1870 two provisional battalions disembarked via sea at Toulon, the first time the Foreign Legion had been deployed in France itself. It attempted to lift the Siege of Paris by breaking through the German lines. It succeeded in retaking Orl\u00e9ans, but failed to break the siege. In January 1871, France capitulated but civil war soon broke out, which led to revolution and the short-lived Paris Commune. The Foreign Legion participated in the suppression of the Commune, which was crushed with great bloodshed.\nTonkin Campaign and Sino-French War 1883\u20131888.\nThe Foreign Legion's First Battalion (Lieutenant-Colonel Donnier) sailed to Tonkin in late 1883, during the period of undeclared hostilities that preceded the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885), and formed part of the attack column that stormed the western gate of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y on 16 December. The Second and Third Infantry Battalions (\"chef de bataillon\" Diguet and Lieutenant-Colonel Schoeffer) were also deployed to Tonkin shortly afterwards, and were present in all the major campaigns of the Sino-French War. Two Foreign Legion companies led the defence at the celebrated Siege of Tuy\u00ean Quang (24 November 1884 to 3 March 1885). In January 1885 the Foreign Legion's 4th Battalion (\"chef de bataillon\" Vitalis) was deployed to the French bridgehead at Keelung (Jilong) in Formosa (Taiwan), where it took part in the later battles of the Keelung Campaign. The battalion played an important role in Colonel Jacques Duchesne's offensive in March 1885 that captured the key Chinese positions of La Table and Fort Bamboo and disengaged Keelung.\nIn December 1883, during a review of the Second Legion Battalion on the eve of its departure for Tonkin to take part in the B\u1eafc Ninh Campaign, General Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier pronounced a famous \"mot\": \"Vous, l\u00e9gionnaires, vous \u00eates soldats pour mourir, et je vous envoie o\u00f9 l'on meurt!\" ('You, Legionnaires, you are soldiers in order to die, and I'm sending you to where one dies!')\nColonisation of Africa.\nAs part of the Army of Africa, the Foreign Legion contributed to the growth of the French colonial empire in Sub-Saharan Africa. Simultaneously, the Legion took part to the pacification of Algeria, suppressing various tribal rebellions and razzias.\nSecond Franco-Dahomean War 1892\u20131894.\nIn 1892, King Behanzin was threatening the French protectorate of Porto-Novo in modern-day Benin and France decided to intervene. A battalion, led by commandant Faurax Montier, was formed from two companies of the First Foreign Regiment and two others from the second regiment. From Cotonou, the legionnaires marched to seize Abomey, the capital of the Kingdom of Dahomey. Two and a half months were needed to reach the city, at the cost of repeated battles against the Dahomean warriors, especially the Amazons of the King. King Behanzin surrendered and was captured by the legionnaires in January 1894.\nSecond Madagascar Expedition 1894\u20131895.\nIn 1895, a battalion, formed by the First and Second Foreign Regiments, was sent to the Kingdom of Madagascar, as part of an expeditionary force whose mission was to conquer the island. The foreign battalion formed the backbone of the column launched on Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. After a few skirmishes, the Queen Ranavalona III promptly surrendered. The Foreign Legion lost 226 men, of whom only a tenth died in actual fighting. Others, like much of the expeditionary force, died from tropical diseases. Despite the success of the expedition, the quelling of sporadic rebellions would take another eight years until 1905, when the island was completely pacified by the French under Joseph Gallieni. During that time, insurrections against the Malagasy Christians of the island, missionaries and foreigners were particularly terrible. Queen Ranavalona III was deposed in January 1897 and was exiled to Algiers in Algeria, where she died in 1917.\nMandingo War 1898.\nFrom 1882 until his capture, Samori Ture, ruler of the Wassoulou Empire, fought the French colonial army, defeating them on several occasions, including a notable victory at Woyowayanko (2 April 1882), in the face of French heavy artillery. Nonetheless, Samori was forced to sign several treaties ceding territory to the French between 1886 and 1889. Samori began a steady retreat, but the fall of other resistance armies, particularly Babemba Traor\u00e9 at Sikasso, permitted the colonial army to launch a concentrated assault against his forces. A battalion of two companies from the 2nd Foreign Regiment was created in early 1894 to pacify the Niger. The Legionnaires' victory at the fortress of Ouilla and police patrols in the region accelerated the submission of the tribes. On 29 September 1898, Samori Ture was captured by the French Commandant Gouraud and exiled to Gabon, marking the end of the Wassoulou Empire.\nMarching Regiments of the Foreign Legion.\nWorld War I 1914\u20131918.\nThe annexation of Alsace and Lorraine by Germany in 1871 led to numerous volunteers from the two regions enlisting in the Foreign Legion, which gave them the option of French citizenship at the end of their service\nWith the declaration of war on 29 July 1914, a call was made for foreigners residing in France to support their adopted country. While many would have preferred direct enlistment in the regular French Army, the only option immediately available was that of the Foreign Legion. On one day only (3 August 1914) a reported 8,000 volunteers applied to enlist in the Paris recruiting office of the Legion.\nIn World War I, the Foreign Legion fought in many critical battles on the Western Front, including Artois, Champagne, Somme, Aisne, and Verdun (in 1917), and also suffered heavy casualties during 1918. The Foreign Legion was also in the Dardanelles and Macedonian front, and was highly decorated for its efforts. Many young foreigners volunteered for the Foreign Legion when the war broke out in 1914. There were marked differences between the idealistic volunteers of 1914 and the hardened men of the old Legion, making assimilation difficult. Nevertheless, the old and the new men of the Foreign Legion fought and died in vicious battles on the Western front, including Belloy-en-Santerre during the Battle of the Somme, where the poet Alan Seeger, after being mortally wounded by machine-gun fire, cheered on the rest of his advancing battalion.\nInterwar Period 1918\u20131939.\nWhile suffering heavy casualties on the Western Front the Legion had emerged from World War I with an enhanced reputation and as one of the most highly decorated units in the French Army. In 1919, the government of Spain raised the Spanish Foreign Legion and modeled it after the French Foreign Legion. General Jean Mordacq intended to rebuild the Foreign Legion as a larger military formation, doing away with the legion's traditional role as a solely infantry formation. General Mordacq envisioned a Foreign Legion consisting not of regiments, but of divisions with cavalry, engineer, and artillery regiments in addition to the legion's infantry mainstay. In 1920, decrees ordained the establishment of regiments of cavalry and artillery. Immediately following the armistice the Foreign Legion experienced an increase of enlistments. The Foreign Legion began the process of reorganizing and redeploying to Algeria.\nThe Legion played a major part in the Rif War of 1920\u201325. In 1932, the Foreign Legion consisted of 30,000 men, serving in six multi-battalion regiments including the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment 1er REI \u2013 Algeria, Syria and Lebanon; 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment 2\u00e8me REI, 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment 3\u00e8me REI, and 4th Foreign Infantry Regiment 4\u00e8me REI \u2013 Morocco, Lebanon; 5th Foreign Infantry 5\u00e8me REI \u2013 Indochina; and 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment 1er REC \u2013 Lebanon, Tunisia and Morocco.\nIn 1931, G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Paul-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rollet assumed the role of 1st Inspector of the Foreign Legion, a post created at his initiative. While serving as Colonel of the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment (1925\u20131931), Rollet was responsible for planning the centennial celebrations of the Legion's foundation; scheduling this event for Camar\u00f3n Day 30 April 1931. He was subsequently credited with creating much of the modern mystique of the Legion by restoring or creating many of its traditions.\nWorld War II 1939\u20131945.\nThe Foreign Legion played a smaller role in World War II in mainland Europe than in World War I, though there was involvement in many exterior theatres of operations, notably sea transport protection through to the Norwegian, Syria-Lebanon, and North African campaigns. The 13th Demi-Brigade, formed for service in Norway, found itself in the UK at the time of the French Armistice (June 1940), was deployed to the British 8th Army in North Africa and distinguished itself in the Battle of Bir Hakeim (1942). Reflecting the divisions of the time, part of the Foreign Legion joined the Free French movement while another part served the Vichy government. German legionnaires were incorporated into the Wehrmacht's 90th Light Infantry Division in North Africa.\nThe Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign of June 1941 saw legionnaire fighting legionnaire as the 13e D.B.L.E clashed with the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6e REI at Damascus. Nevertheless, many legionnaires of the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6e (dissolved on 31 December 1941) integrated the Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion R.M.L.E in 1942. Later, a thousand of the rank-and-file of the Vichy Legion unit joined the 13e D.B.L.E. of the Free French forces which were also part as of September 1944 of Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's successful Amalgam of the French Liberation Army (), the (400,000 men) amalgam consisted of the Armistice Army, the Free French Forces and the French Forces of the Interior which formed Army B and were later part of the French 1st Army with forces also issued from the French Resistance.\nAlsace-Lorraine.\nFollowing World War II, many French-speaking German former soldiers joined the Foreign Legion to pursue a military career, an option no longer possible in Germany including French German soldiers of Malgr\u00e9-nous. It would have been considered problematic if the men from Alsace-Lorraine did not speak French. These French-speaking former German soldiers made up as much as 60 percent of the Legion during the war in Indochina. Contrary to popular belief however, French policy was to exclude former members of the Waffen-SS, and candidates for induction were refused if they exhibited the tell-tale blood type tattoo, or even a scar that might be masking it.\nThe high percentage of Germans was contrary to normal policy concerning a single dominant nationality, and in more recent times Germans have made up a much smaller percentage of the Foreign Legion's composition.\nFirst Indochina War 1946\u20131954.\nDuring the First Indochina War (1946\u201354) the Foreign Legion saw its numbers swell due to the incorporation of World War II veterans. Although the Foreign Legion distinguished itself in a territory where it had served since the 1880s, it also suffered a heavy toll during this war. Constantly being deployed in operations, units of the Legion suffered particularly heavy losses in the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu, before the fortified valley finally fell on 7 May 1954. No fewer than 72,833 served in Indochina during the eight-year war. The Legion suffered the loss of 10,283 of its own men in combat: 309 officers, 1082 sous-officiers and 9092 legionnaires .\nWhile only one of several Legion units involved in Indochina, the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP) particularly distinguished itself, while being annihilated twice. It was renamed the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) after its third reformation.\nThe 1er BEP sailed to Indochina on 12 November and was then engaged in combat operations in Tonkin. On 17 November 1950 the battalion parachuted into That Kh\u00e9 and suffered heavy losses at Coc Xa. Reconstituted on 1 March 1951, the battalion participated in combat operations at Cho Ben, on the Black River and in Annam. On 21 November 1953 the reconstituted 1er BEP was parachuted into Dien Bien Phu. In this battle, the unit lost 575 killed and missing. Reconstituted for the third time on 19 May 1954, the battalion left Indochina on 8 February 1955. The 1er BEP received five citations and the fourrag\u00e8re of the colors of the M\u00e9daille militaire for its service in Indochina. The 1er BEP became the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) in Algeria on 1 September 1955.\nDien Bien Phu fell on 7 May 1954 at 17:30. The couple of hectares that were the battlefield today are corn fields surrounding a stele which commemorates the sacrifices of those who died there. While the garrison of Dien Bien Phu included French regular, North African, and locally recruited (Indochinese) units, the battle has become associated particularly with the paratroops of the Foreign Legion.\nDuring the Indochina War, the Legion operated several armoured trains which were an enduring \"Rolling Symbol\" during the chartered course duration of French Indochina. The Legion also operated various Passage Companies relative to the continental conflicts at hand.\nAlgerian War 1954\u20131962.\nForeign Legion paratroops.\nThe legion was heavily engaged in fighting against the National Liberation Front and the Arm\u00e9e de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale (ALN). The main activity during the period 1954\u20131962 was as part of the operations of the 10th Parachute Division and 25th Parachute Division. The 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment, 1er REP, was under the command of the 10th Parachute Division (France), 10\u00e8me DP, and the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, 2\u00e8me REP, was under the command of the 25th Parachute Division (France), 25\u00e8me DP. While both the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP), and the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2\u00e8me REP), were part of the operations of French parachute divisions (10\u00e8me DP and 25\u00e8me DP established in 1956), the Legion's 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP), and the Legion's 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2\u00e8me REP), are older than the French divisions. The 1er REP was the former thrice-reconstituted 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP) and the 2\u00e8me REP was the former 2nd Foreign Parachute Battalion (2\u00e8me BEP). Both battalions were renamed and their Legionnaires transferred from Indochina on 1 August 1954 to Algeria by 1 November 1954. Both traced their origins to the Parachute Company of the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment commanded by Legion Lieutenant Jacques Morin attached to the III/1er R.C.P.\nWith the start of the War in Algeria on 1 November 1954, the two foreign participating parachute battalions back from Indochina, the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP, III Formation) and the 2nd Foreign Parachute Battalion (2\u00e8me BEP), were not part of any French parachute divisions yet and were not designated as regiments until September and 1 December 1955 respectively.\nMain operations during the Algerian War included the Battle of Algiers and the Bataille of the Frontiers, fought by 60,000 soldiers including French and Foreign Legion paratroopers. For paratroopers of the Legion, the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) and 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2\u00e8me REP), were the only known foreign active parachute regiments, exclusively commanded by Pierre Paul Jeanpierre for the 1er REP and the paratrooper commanders of the 2\u00e8me REP. The remainder of French paratrooper units of the French Armed Forces were commanded by Jacques Massu, Buchond, Marcel Bigeard, Paul Aussaresses. Other Legion offensives in the mountains in 1959 included operations Jumelles, Cigales, and Ari\u00e8ge in the Aures and the last in Kabylie.\nThe image of the Legion as a professional and non-political force was tarnished when the elite 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment 1er REP, which was also part of the 10th Parachute Division played a leading role in the generals' putsch of 1961 and was subsequently disbanded.\nGenerals' putsch and reduction of Foreign Legion.\nComing out of a difficult Indochinese conflict, the French Foreign Legion, reinforced cohesion by extending the duration of basic training. Efforts exerted were successful during this transit; however, entering into December 1960 and the generals' putsch, a crisis hit the legion putting its faith at the corps of the Army.\nFor having rallied to the generals' putsch of April 1961, the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment of the 10th Parachute Division was dissolved on 30 April 1961 at Zeralda.\nIn 1961, at the issue of the putsch, the 1st Mounted Saharan Squadron of the Foreign Legion() received the missions to assure surveillance and policing.\nThe independence of Algeria from the French in 1962 was traumatising since it ended with the enforced abandonment of the barracks command center at Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s established in 1842. Upon being notified that the elite regiment was to be disbanded and that they were to be reassigned, legionnaires of the 1er REP burned the Chinese pavilion acquired following the Siege of Tuy\u00ean Quang in 1884. The relics from the Legion's history museum, including the wooden hand of Captain Jean Danjou, subsequently accompanied the Legion to France. Also removed from Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s were the symbolic Legion remains of General Paul-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rollet ( The Father of the Legion ), Legion officer Prince Count Aage of Rosenborg, and Legionnaire Heinz Zimmermann (last fatal casualty in Algeria).\nThe Legion acquired its parade song \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (\"No, I regret nothing\"), a 1960 \u00c9dith Piaf song sung by Sous-Officiers and legionnaires as they left their barracks for re-deployment following the Algiers putsch of 1961. The song has remained a part of Legion heritage since.\nThe 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment 1er REP was disbanded on 30 April 1961. However, the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2\u00e8me REP prevailed in existence, while most of the personnel of the Saharan Companies were integrated into the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment, 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment and 4th Foreign Infantry Regiment respectively.\nPost-colonial Africa.\nBy the mid-1960s the Legion had lost its traditional and spiritual home in French Algeria and elite units had been dissolved. President de Gaulle considered disbanding it altogether but, being reminded of the Marching Regiments, and that the 13th Demi-Brigade was one of the first units to declare for him in 1940 and taking also into consideration the effective service of various Saharan units and performances of other Legions units, he chose instead to downsize the Legion from 40,000 to 8,000 men and relocate it to metropolitan France. Legion units continued to be assigned to overseas service, although not in North Africa (see below).\n1962\u2013present.\nIn the early 1960s, and besides ongoing global rapid deployments, the Legion also stationed forces on various continents while operating different function units.\nFrom 1965 to 1967, the Legion operated several companies, including the 5th Heavy Weight Transport Company (CTGP), mainly in charge of evacuating the Sahara. The area of responsibility of some of these units extended from the confines of the in-between of the Sahara to the Mediterranean. Ongoing interventions and rapid deployments two years later and the following years included in part:\nGulf War 1990\u20132020.\nIn September 1990, the 1st Foreign Regiment 1er RE, the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment 1er REC, the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2\u00e8me REP, the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment 2\u00e8me REI, and the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment 6\u00e8me REG were sent to the Persian Gulf as a part of Op\u00e9ration Daguet along with the 1st Spahi Regiment, the 11th Marine Artillery Regiment, the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment, the 21st Marine Infantry Regiment, the French Army Light Aviation, the Marine Infantry Tank Regiment, French paratroopers regiments including components of the 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment 35\u00e8me RAP, the 1st Parachute Hussard Regiment 1er RHP, the 17th Parachute Engineer Regiment 17\u00e8me RGP and other airborne contingents. Division Daguet was commanded by G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade Bernard Janvier.\nThe Legion force, mainly comprising 27 different nationalities, was attached to the French 6th Light Armoured Division 6\u00e8me D.L.B, whose mission was to protect the Coalition's left flank while cover fired by the marine's artillery. During the Gulf War, DINOPS operated in support of the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division, and provided the EOD services to the division. After the cease fire took hold they conducted a joint mine clearing operation alongside a Royal Australian Navy Clearance Diver Team Unit.\nAfter the four-week air campaign, coalition forces launched the ground offensive. They quickly penetrated deep into Iraq, with the Legion taking the As-Salman Airport, meeting little resistance. The war ended after a hundred hours of fighting on the ground, which resulted in very light casualties for the Legion.\nComposition and organization.\nPrior to the end of the Algerian War the legion had not been stationed in mainland France except in wartime. Until 1962, the Foreign Legion headquarters, garrison quartier Vienot of Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s was in French Algeria. Today, some units of the L\u00e9gion are in Corsica or overseas possessions (mainly in French Guiana, guarding Guiana Space Centre), while the rest are in the south of mainland France. Current headquarters, garrison quartier Vienot of Aubagne is in France, just outside Marseille. As a result of a recruiting drive in the wake of the November 2015 Paris attacks, the Legion will be 8,900 men strong in 2018.\nCurrent deployments.\nThese are the following deployments:\nNote: English names for countries or territories are in parentheses.\nRecruitment process.\nBasic training.\nWhile all rank and file members of the Legion are required to serve under \"Foreign Status\" (\"\u00e0 titre \u00e9tranger\"), even if they are French nationals, non-commissioned and commissioned officers can serve under either French or Foreign Status. Foreign Status NCOs and officers are exclusively promoted from the ranks and in 2016 represented 10% of the Officer Corps of the Legion. French Status officers are either members of other units of the French Army affected to the Legion or promoted L\u00e9gionnaires who have chosen to become French nationals.\nBasic training for the Foreign Legion is conducted in the 4th Foreign Regiment. This is an operational combat regiment which provides a training course of 15\u201317 weeks, before recruits are assigned to their operational units:\nEducation in the French language (reading, writing and pronunciation) is taught on a daily basis throughout all of basic training.\nTraditions.\nAs the Foreign Legion is composed of soldiers of different nationalities and backgrounds, it is necessary to develop an intense \"esprit de corps\", which is achieved through the development of camaraderie, specific traditions, the loyalty of its legionnaires, the quality of their training, and the pride of being a soldier in an elite unit.\nCode of honour.\nThe \"Legionnaire's Code of Honour\" is the Legion's creed, recited in French only. The Code of Honour was adopted in the 1980s.\nMottos.\n\"Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9\".\nIn contrast to all other French Army units, the motto embroidered on the Foreign Legion's regimental flags is not \"Honneur et Patrie\" (Honour and Fatherland) but \"Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9\" (Honour and Fidelity).\n\"Legio Patria Nostra\".\n\"Legio Patria Nostra\" (in French \"La L\u00e9gion est notre Patrie\", in English \"The Legion is our Fatherland\") is the Latin motto of the Foreign Legion. The adoption of the Foreign Legion as a new \"Fatherland\" does not imply the repudiation by the legionnaire of his original nationality. The Foreign Legion is required to obtain the agreement of any legionnaire before he is placed in any situation where he might have to serve against his country of birth.\nMarching songs.\n\"\"Le Boudin\".\n\"Le Boudin\"\" is the marching song of the Foreign Legion.\nRanks.\nAll volunteers in the French Foreign Legion begin their careers as basic legionnaires with one in four eventually becoming a \"sous-officier\" (non-commissioned officer). On joining, a new recruit receives a monthly salary of \u20ac1,200 in addition to food and lodgings. He is also given his own new rifle, which according to the lore of the \"Legion\" must never be left on a battlefield. Promotion is concurrent with the ranks in the French Army.\nNon-Commissioned and Warrant Officers.\nA \"Sous-officier\"'s insignia is composed of three components; rank emblem, regimental patch, and seniority chevrons. In the one pictured, the three upward pointing gold chevrons indicate a \"Sergent-chef\". The diamond-shaped regimental patch (\"\u00c9cusson\") is formed of three green diamond shapes surrounding a grenade emblem, with the three diamonds indicating a Colonial unit, in comparison to one diamond for a unit of Regulars, or two diamonds for a Reserves unit. The L\u00e9gion grenade emblem has seven flames rather than the usual five, and the two downward pointing seniority chevrons indicate at least 10 years of service. Some \"Caporal\"s-\"Chef\" may have as many as six seniority chevrons for 30 or more years of service.\n\"Sous-officiers\" (NCOs) including warrant officers account for 25% of the current Foreign Legion's total manpower.\nCommissioned Officers.\nMost officers are seconded from the French Army though roughly 10% are former non-commissioned officers promoted from the ranks.\nSeniority chevrons.\nThe Foreign Legion uses gold coloured chevrons (\"chevrons d'anciennet\u00e9\") to indicate seniority. Worn only by ordinary legionnaires and non-commissioned officers beneath rank insignia, each chevron denotes five years of service in the Legion.\nHonorary ranks.\nHonorary ranks have been awarded by the French Army to individuals credited with exceptional acts of courage since 1796. In the Foreign Legion, General Paul-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rollet introduced the practice of awarding honorary Legion ranks to distinguished individuals, both civilian and military, in the early 20th century. \nRecipients of these honorary appointments had participated with units of the Legion on active service in an exemplary manner, or had rendered exceptional service to the Legion in non-combat situations. More than 1,200 individuals have been granted honorary ranks in the Legion \"pour services \u00e9minent\". The majority of these awards have been made to military personnel in wartime, earning titles such as \"Legionnaire d'Honneur\" or \"Sergent-Chef de L\u00e9gion d'honneur\", while other recipients have included nurses, journalists, painters, and ministers who have rendered meritorious service to the Foreign Legion.\nPioneers.\nThe \"Pionniers\" (pioneers) are the combat engineers and a traditional unit of the Foreign Legion. The sapper traditionally sport large beards, wear leather aprons and gloves and hold axes. The sappers were very common in European armies during the Napoleonic Era but progressively disappeared during the 19th century. The French Army, including the Legion disbanded its regimental sapper platoons in 1870. However, in 1931 one of a number of traditions restored to mark the hundredth anniversary of the Legion's founding was the reestablishment of its bearded \"Pionniers\".\nIn the French Army, since the 18th century, every infantry regiment included a small detachment of pioneers. In addition to undertaking road building and entrenchment work, such units were tasked with using their axes and shovels to clear obstacles under enemy fire opening the way for the rest of the infantry. The danger of such missions was recognised by allowing certain privileges, such as being authorised to wear beards.\nThe current pioneer platoon of the Foreign Legion is provided by the Legion depot and headquarters regiment for public ceremonies. The unit has reintroduced the symbols of the Napoleonic sappers: the beard, the axe, the leather apron, the crossed-axes insignia and the leather gloves. When parades of the Foreign Legion are opened by this unit, it is to commemorate the traditional role of the sappers \"opening the way\" for the troops.\nCadences and marching steps.\nAlso notable is the marching pace of the Foreign Legion. In comparison to the 116-step-per-minute pace of other French units, the Foreign Legion has an 88-step-per-minute marching speed. It is also referred to by Legionnaires as the \"crawl\". This can be seen at ceremonial parades and public displays attended by the Foreign Legion, particularly while parading in Paris on 14 July (Bastille Day Military Parade). Because of the impressively slow pace, the Foreign Legion is always the last unit marching in any parade. The Foreign Legion is normally accompanied by its own band, which traditionally plays the march of any one of the Foreign Legion's regiments, except that of the unit actually on parade. The regimental song of each unit and \"Le Boudin\" is sung by legionnaires standing at attention. Also, because the Foreign Legion must always stay together, it does not break formation into two when approaching the presidential grandstand, as other French military units do, in order to preserve the unity of the legion.\nContrary to popular belief, the adoption of the Foreign Legion's slow marching speed was not due to a need to preserve energy and fluids during long marches under the hot Algerian sun. Its exact origins are somewhat unclear, but the official explanation is that although the pace regulation does not seem to have been instituted before 1945, it hails back to the slow marching pace of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, and its reintroduction was a \"return to traditional roots\". This was in fact, the march step of the Foreign Legion's ancestor units \u2013 the \"R\u00e9giments \u00c9trangers\" or Foreign Regiments of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" French Army, the \"Grande Arm\u00e9e\"s foreign units, and the pre-1831 foreign regiments.\nUniform.\nFrom its foundation until World War I the Foreign Legion normally wore the uniform of the French line infantry for parade with a few special distinctions. Essentially this consisted of a dark blue coat (later tunic) worn with red trousers. The field uniform was often modified under the influence of the extremes of climate and terrain in which the Foreign Legion served. Shakos were soon replaced by the light cloth kepi, which was far more suitable for North African conditions. The practice of wearing heavy \"capotes\" (greatcoats) on the march and \"vestes\" (short hip-length jackets) as working dress in barracks was followed by the Foreign Legion from its establishment.\nOne short lived aberration was the wearing of green uniforms in 1856 by Foreign Legion units recruited in Switzerland for service in the Crimean War. In the Crimea itself (1854\u201359) a hooded coat and red or blue waist sashes were adopted for winter dress, while during the Mexican Intervention (1863\u201365) straw hats or sombreros were sometimes substituted for the kepi. When the latter was worn it was usually covered with a white \"havelock\" (linen cover) \u2013 the predecessor of the white kepi that was to become a symbol of the Foreign Legion. Foreign Legion units serving in France during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371 were distinguishable only by minor details of insignia from the bulk of the French infantry. However subsequent colonial campaigns saw an increasing use of special garments for hot weather wear such as collarless \"keo\" blouses in Tonkin 1884\u201385, khaki drill jackets in Dahomey (1892) and drab covered topees worn with all-white fatigue dress in Madagascar (1895).\nIn the early 20th century the legionnaire wore a red kepi with blue band and piping, dark blue tunic with red collar, red cuff patches, and red trousers. Distinctive features were the green epaulettes (replacing the red of the line) worn with red woollen fringes; plus the embroidered Legion badge of a red flaming grenade, worn on the kepi front instead of a regimental number. In the field a light khaki cover was worn over the kepi, sometimes with a protective neck curtain attached. The standard medium-blue double breasted greatcoat (\"capote\") of the French infantry was worn, usually buttoned back to free the legs for marching. From the 1830s the legionnaires had worn a broad blue woollen sash around the waist, like other European units of the French Army of Africa (such as the Zouaves or the Chasseurs d'Afrique), while indigenous units of the Army of Africa (spahis and tirailleurs) wore red sashes. White linen trousers tucked into short leather leggings were substituted for red serge in hot weather. This was the origin of the \"Beau Geste\" image.\nIn barracks a white bleached kepi cover was often worn together with a short dark blue jacket (\"veste\") or white blouse plus white trousers. The original kepi cover was khaki and due to constant washing turned white quickly. The white or khaki kepi cover was not unique to the Foreign Legion at this stage but was commonly seen amongst other French units in North Africa. It later became particularly identified with the Foreign Legion as the unit most likely to serve at remote frontier posts (other than locally recruited tirailleurs who wore fezzes or turbans). The variances of climate in North Africa led the French Army to the sensible expedient of letting local commanders decide on the appropriate \"tenue de jour\" (uniform of the day) according to circumstances. Thus a legionnaire might parade or walk out in blue tunic and white trousers in hot weather, blue tunic and red trousers in normal temperatures or wear the blue greatcoat with red trousers under colder conditions. The sash could be worn with greatcoat, blouse or veste but not with the tunic. Epaulettes were a detachable dress item worn only with tunic or greatcoat for parade or off duty wear.\nOfficers wore the same dark blue (almost black) tunics as those of their colleagues in the French line regiments, except that black replaced red as a facing colour on collar and cuffs. Gold fringed epaulettes were worn for full dress and rank was shown by the number of gold rings on both kepi and cuffs. Trousers were red with black stripes or white according to occasion or conditions. All-white or light khaki uniforms (from as early as the 1890s) were often worn in the field or for ordinary duties in barracks. Non-commissioned officers were distinguished by red or gold diagonal stripes on the lower sleeves of tunics, vestes and greatcoats. Small detachable stripes were buttoned on to the front of the white shirt-like blouse.\nPrior to 1914 units in Indo-China wore white or khaki Colonial Infantry uniforms with Foreign Legion insignia, to overcome supply difficulties. This dress included a white sun helmet of a model that was also worn by Foreign Legion units serving in the outposts of Southern Algeria, though never popular with its wearers. During the initial months of World War I, Foreign Legion units serving in France wore the standard blue greatcoat and red trousers of the French line infantry, distinguished only by collar patches of the same blue as the capote, instead of red. After a short period in sky-blue the Foreign Legion adopted khaki with steel helmets, from early 1916. A mustard shade of khaki drill had been worn on active service in Morocco from 1909, replacing the classic blue and white. The latter continued to be worn in the relatively peaceful conditions of Algeria throughout World War I, although increasingly replaced by khaki drill. The pre-1914 blue and red uniforms could still be occasionally seen as garrison dress in Algeria until stocks were used up about 1919.\nDuring the early 1920s plain khaki drill uniforms of a standard pattern became universal issue for the Foreign Legion with only the red and blue kepi (with or without a cover) and green collar braiding to distinguish the Legionnaire from other French soldiers serving in North African and Indo-China. The neck curtain ceased to be worn from about 1915, although it survived in the newly raised Foreign Legion Cavalry Regiment into the 1920s. The white blouse (\"bourgeron\") and trousers dating from 1882 were retained for fatigue wear until the 1930s.\nAt the time of the Foreign Legion's centennial in 1931, a number of traditional features were reintroduced at the initiative of the then commander Colonel Rollet. These included the blue sash and green/red epaulettes. In 1939 the white covered kepi won recognition as the official headdress of the Foreign Legion to be worn on most occasions, rather than simply as a means of reflecting heat and protecting the blue and red material underneath. The Third Foreign Infantry Regiment adopted white tunics and trousers for walking-out dress during the 1930s\nand all Foreign Legion officers were required to obtain full dress uniforms in the pre-war colours of black and red from 1932 to 1939.\nDuring World War II the Foreign Legion wore a wide range of uniform styles depending on supply sources. These ranged from the heavy capotes and Adrian helmets of 1940 through to British battledress and American field uniforms from 1943 to 1945. The white kepi was stubbornly retained whenever possible.\nFrom 1940 until 1963 the Foreign Legion maintained four Saharan Companies (\"Compagnies Sahariennes\") as part of the French forces used to patrol and police the desert regions to the south of Morocco and Algeria. Special uniforms were developed for these units, modeled on those of the French officered Camel Corps (\"M\u00e9haristes\") having prime responsibility for the Sahara. In full dress these included black or white zouave style trousers, worn with white tunics and long flowing cloaks. The Legion companies maintained their separate identity by retaining their distinctive kepis, sashes and fringed epaulettes.\nThe white kepis, together with the sash and epaulettes survive in the Foreign Legion's modern parade dress. Since the 1990s the modern kepi has been made wholly of white material rather than simply worn with a white cover. Officers and senior noncommissioned officers still wear their kepis in the pre-1939 colours of dark blue and red. A green tie and (for officers) a green waistcoat recall the traditional branch colour of the Foreign Legion. From 1959 a green beret (previously worn only by the legion's paratroopers) became the universal ordinary duty headdress, with the kepi reserved for parade and off duty wear. Other items of currently worn dress are the standard issue of the French Army.\nEquipment.\nThe Foreign Legion is basically equipped with the same equipment as similar units elsewhere in the French Army. These include:\nComposition.\nThe Foreign Legion is the only unit of the French Army open to people of any nationality. Most legionnaires still come from European countries but a growing percentage comes from Latin America. Most of the Foreign Legion's commissioned officers are French with approximately 10 percent being Legionnaires who have risen through the ranks.\nLegionnaires were, in the past, forced to enlist under a pseudonym (\"declared identity\"). This policy existed in order to allow recruits who wanted to restart their lives to enlist. The Legion held the belief that it was fairer to make all new recruits use declared identities. French citizens can enlist under a declared, fictitious, foreign citizenship (generally, a francophone one, often that of Belgium, Canada, or Switzerland). As of 20 September 2010, new recruits may enlist under their real identities or under declared identities. Recruits who do enlist with declared identities may, after one year's service, regularise their situations under their true identities. After serving in the Foreign Legion for three years, a legionnaire may apply for French citizenship. He must be serving under his real name, must have no problems with the authorities, and must have served with \"honour and fidelity\". A soldier who becomes injured during a battle for France can immediately apply for French citizenship under a provision known as \"Fran\u00e7ais par le sang vers\u00e9\" (\"French by spilled blood\").\nWhile the Foreign Legion historically did not accept women in its ranks, there was one official female member, Susan Travers, an Englishwoman who joined Free French Forces during World War II and became a member of the Foreign Legion after the war, serving in Vietnam during the First Indochina War. Women were barred from service until 2000, when then-French Defence Minister Alain Richard had stated that he wanted to take the level of female recruitment in the Legion to 20 percent by 2020.\nMembership by country.\nAs of 2008, legionnaires came from 140 countries. The majority of enlisted men originate from outside France, while the majority of the officer corps consists of Frenchmen. Many recruits originate from Eastern Europe and Latin America. Neil Tweedie of \"The Daily Telegraph\" said that Germany traditionally provided many recruits, \"somewhat ironically given the Legion's bloody role in two world wars.\" He added that \"Brits, too, have played their part, but there was embarrassment recently when it emerged that many British applicants were failing selection due to endemic unfitness.\"\nAlsace-Lorraine.\nOriginal nationalities of the Foreign Legion reflect the events in history at the time they join. Many former Wehrmacht personnel joined in the wake of World War II as many soldiers returning to civilian life found it hard to find reliable employment. Jean-Denis Lepage reports that \"The Foreign Legion discreetly recruited from German P.O.W. camps\", but adds that the number of these recruits has been subsequently exaggerated. Bernard B. Fall, who was a supporter of the French government, writing in the context of the First Indochina War, questioned the notion that the Foreign Legion was mainly German at that time, calling it:\n[a] canard\u2026with the sub-variant that all those Germans were at least SS generals and other much wanted war criminals. As a rule, and in order to prevent any particular nation from making the Foreign Legion into a Praetorian Guard, any particular national component is kept at about 25 percent of the total. Even supposing (and this was the case, of course) that the French recruiters, in the eagerness for candidates would sign up Germans enlisting as Swiss, Austrian, Scandinavian and other nationalities of related ethnic background, it is unlikely that the number of Germans in the Foreign Legion ever exceeded 35 percent. Thus, without making an allowance for losses, rotation, discharges, etc., the maximum number of Germans fighting in Indochina at any one time reached perhaps 7,000 out of 278,000. As to the ex-Nazis, the early arrivals contained a number of them, none of whom were known to be war criminals. French intelligence saw to that.\nSince, in view of the rugged Indochinese climate, older men without previous tropical experience constituted more a liability than an asset, the average age of the Foreign Legion enlistees was about 23. At the time of the battle of Dien Bien Phu, any legionnaire of that age group was at the worst, in his \"Hitler Youth\" shorts when the [Third] Reich collapsed.\nThe Foreign Legion accepts people enlisting under a nationality that is not their own. A proportion of the Swiss and Belgians are actually likely to be Frenchmen who wish to avoid detection. In addition many Alsatians are said to have joined the Foreign Legion when Alsace was part of the German Empire, and may have been recorded as German while considering themselves French.\nRegarding recruitment conditions within the Foreign Legion, see the official page (in English) dedicated to the subject: With regard to age limits, recruits can be accepted from ages ranging from 17 \u00bd (with parental consent) to 39.5 years old.\nCountries that allow post-Foreign Legion contract.\nIn the Commonwealth Realms, its collective provisions provide for nationals to commute between armies in training or other purposes. Moreover, this 'blanket provision' between member-states cannot exclude others for it would seem inappropriate to single out individual countries, that is, France in relation to the Legion. For example, Australia and New Zealand may allow post-Legion enlistment providing the national has commonwealth citizenship. Britain allows post-Legion enlistment. Canada allows post-Legion enlistment in its ranks with a completed five-year contract.\nIn the European Union framework, post Legion enlistment is less clear. Denmark, Norway, Germany and Portugal allow post-Legion enlistment while The Netherlands has constitutional articles that forbid it. [Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap, Artikel 15, lid 1e, (In Dutch:)] (that is: one can lose his Dutch nationality by accepting a foreign nationality or can lose his Dutch nationality by serving in the army of a foreign state that is engaged in a conflict against the Dutch Kingdom or one of its allies). The European Union twin threads seem to be recognized dual nationality status or restricting constitutional article.\nThe United States allows post-FFL enlistment in its National Guard of career soldiers (up to the rank of captain) who are Green Card holders.\nIsrael allows post-Legion enlistment.\nOne of the biggest national groups in the Legion are Poles. Polish law allows service in a foreign army, but only after written permission from the Ministry of National Defence.\nEmulation by other countries.\nChinese Ever Victorious Army.\nThe Ever Victorious Army was the name given to a Chinese imperial army in the late 19th century. Commanded by Frederick Townsend Ward, the new force originally comprised about 200 mostly European mercenaries, recruited in the Shanghai area from sailors, deserters and adventurers. Many were dismissed in the summer of 1861, but the remainder became the officers of the Chinese soldiers recruited mainly in and around Sungkiang (Songjiang). The Chinese troops were increased to 3,000 by May 1862, all equipped with Western firearms and equipment by the British authorities in Shanghai. Throughout its four-year existence the Ever Victorious Army was mainly to operate within a thirty-mile radius of Shanghai. It was disbanded in May 1864 with 104 foreign officers and 2,288 Chinese soldiers being paid off. The bulk of the artillery and some infantry transferred to the Chinese Imperial forces. It was the first Chinese army trained in European techniques, tactics, and strategy.\nIsraeli Mahal.\nIn Israel, Mahal (, an acronym for \"Mitnadvei \u1e24utz LaAretz\", which means \"Volunteers from outside the Land [of Israel]\") is a term designating non-Israelis serving in the Israeli military. The term originates with the approximately 4,000 both Jewish and non-Jewish volunteers who went to Israel to fight in the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War including Aliyah Bet. The original Mahalniks were mostly World War II veterans who had previously served in the American and British armed forces.\nToday, there is a program, Garin Tzabar, within the Israeli Ministry of Defense that administers the enlistment of non-Israeli citizens in the country's armed forces. Programs enable foreigners to join the Israel Defense Forces if they are of Jewish descent (which is defined as at least one grandparent).\nNetherlands KNIL Army.\nThough not named \"Foreign Legion\", the Dutch Koninklijk Nederlandsch-Indische Leger (KNIL), or Royal Netherlands-Indian Army (in reference to the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia), was created in 1830, a year before the French Foreign Legion, and is therefore not an emulation but an entirely original idea and had a similar recruitment policy. It stopped being an army of foreigners around 1900 when recruitment was restricted to Dutch citizens and to the indigenous peoples of the Dutch East Indies. The KNIL was finally disbanded on 26 July 1950, seven months after the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesia as a sovereign state, and almost five years after Indonesia declared its independence.\nRhodesian Light Infantry and 7 Independent Company.\nDuring the Rhodesian Bush War of the 1960s and 1970s, the Rhodesian Security Forces enlisted volunteers from overseas on the same pay and conditions of service as locally based regulars. The vast majority of the Rhodesian Army's foreigners joined the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), a heliborne commando regiment with a glamorous international reputation; this unit became colloquially known as the \"Rhodesian foreign legion\" as a result, even though foreigners never made up more than about a third of its men. According to Chris Cocks, an RLI veteran, \"the RLI was a mirror of the French Foreign Legion, in that recruiters paid little heed as to a man's past and asked no questions. ... And like the Foreign Legion, once in the ranks, a man's past was irrelevant.\" Just as French Foreign Legionnaires must speak French, the Rhodesian Army required its foreigners to be English-speakers. Many of them were professional soldiers, attracted by the regiment's reputation\u2014mostly former British soldiers, or Vietnam veterans from the United States, Australian and New Zealand forces\u2014and these became a key part of the unit. Others, with no military experience, were often motivated to join the Rhodesian Army by their opposition to communism, or a desire for adventure or to escape the past.\nAfter the Rhodesians' overseas recruiting campaign for English-speakers, started in 1974, proved successful, they began recruiting French-speakers as well, in 1977. These francophone recruits were placed in their own unit, 7 Independent Company, Rhodesia Regiment, which was commanded by French-speaking officers and operated entirely in French. The experiment was not generally considered a success by the Rhodesian commanders, however, and the company was disbanded in early 1978.\nRussian \"Foreign Legion\".\nIn 2010 the service conditions of the Russian Military have been changed. The actual term \"Russian Foreign Legion\" is a colloquial expression without any official recognition. Under the plan, foreigners without dual citizenship are able to sign up for five-year contracts and will be eligible for Russian citizenship after serving three years. Experts say the change opens the way for Commonwealth of Independent States citizens to get fast-track Russian citizenship, and counter the effects of Russia's demographic crisis on its army recruitment.\nSpanish Foreign Legion.\nThe Spanish Foreign Legion was created in 1920, in emulation of the French one, and had a significant role in Spain's colonial wars in Morocco and in the Spanish Civil War on the Nationalist side. The Spanish Foreign Legion recruited foreigners until 1986 but unlike its French model, the number of non-Spanish recruits never exceeded 25%, most of these from Latin America. It is now called the \"Spanish Legion\" and only recruits Spanish nationals.\nReferences in popular culture.\nBeyond its reputation as an elite unit often engaged in serious fighting, the recruitment practices of the French Foreign Legion have also led to a somewhat romanticised view of it being a place for disgraced or \"wronged\" men looking to leave behind their old lives and start new ones. This view of the legion is common in literature, and has been used for dramatic effect in many films, not the least of which are the several versions of \"Beau Geste\"."}

This device illustrated the principle of feedback: a low water level opens the valve, the rising water then provides feedback into the system, closing the valve when the required level is reached. This then reoccurs in a circular fashion as the water level fluctuates.\nCentrifugal governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the 17th century. In 1788, James Watt designed his first centrifugal governor following a suggestion from his business partner Matthew Boulton, for use in the steam engines of their production. Early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion, and were used for pumping water \u2013 an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed, but the use of steam engines for other applications called for more precise control of the speed.\nIn 1868, James Clerk Maxwell wrote a famous paper, \"On governors\", that is widely considered a classic in feedback control theory. This was a landmark paper on control theory and the mathematics of feedback.\nThe verb phrase \"to feed back\", in the sense of returning to an earlier position in a mechanical process, was in use in the US by the 1860s, and in 1909, Nobel laureate Karl Ferdinand Braun used the term \"feed-back\" as a noun to refer to (undesired) coupling between components of an electronic circuit.\nBy the end of 1912, researchers using early electronic amplifiers (audions) had discovered that deliberately coupling part of the output signal back to the input circuit would boost the amplification (through regeneration), but would also cause the audion to howl or sing. This action of feeding back of the signal from output to input gave rise to the use of the term \"feedback\" as a distinct word by 1920.\nOver the years there has been some dispute as to the best definition of feedback. According to Ashby (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in the principles of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of \"circularity of action\", which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more practical aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection.\nFocusing on uses in management theory, Ramaprasad (1983) defines feedback generally as \"...information about the gap between the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter\" that is used to \"alter the gap in some way\". He emphasizes that the information by itself is not feedback unless translated into action.\nTypes.\nPositive and negative feedback.\nPositive feedback: If the signal feedback from output is in phase with the input signal, the feedback is called positive feedback.\nNegative feedback: If the signal feedback is of opposite polarity or out of phase by 180\u00b0 with respect to input signal, the feedback is called as negative feedback.\nAs an example of negative feedback, the diagram might represent a cruise control system in a car, for example, that matches a target speed such as the speed limit. The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a speedometer. The error signal is the departure of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimizing the road disturbance.\nThe terms \"positive\" and \"negative\" were first applied to feedback prior to WWII. The idea of positive feedback was already current in the 1920s with the introduction of the regenerative circuit. Friis and Jensen (1924) described regeneration in a set of electronic amplifiers as a case where \"the \"feed-back\" action is positive\" in contrast to negative feed-back action, which they mention only in passing. Harold Stephen Black's classic 1934 paper first details the use of negative feedback in electronic amplifiers. According to Black:\nAccording to Mindell (2002) confusion in the terms arose shortly after this:\nEven prior to the terms being applied, James Clerk Maxwell had described several kinds of \"component motions\" associated with the centrifugal governors used in steam engines, distinguishing between those that lead to a continual \"increase\" in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation, and those that lead to a \"decrease\" of the same.\nTerminology.\nThe terms positive and negative feedback are defined in different ways within different disciplines.\nThe two definitions may cause confusion, such as when an incentive (reward) is used to boost poor performance (narrow a gap). Referring to definition 1, some authors use alternative terms, replacing \"positive/negative\" with \"self-reinforcing/self-correcting\", \"reinforcing/balancing\", \"discrepancy-enhancing/discrepancy-reducing\" or \"regenerative/degenerative\" respectively. And for definition 2, some authors advocate describing the action or effect as positive/negative \"reinforcement\" or \"punishment\" rather than feedback.\nYet even within a single discipline an example of feedback can be called either positive or negative, depending on how values are measured or referenced.\nThis confusion may arise because feedback can be used for either \"informational\" or \"motivational\" purposes, and often has both a \"qualitative\" and a \"quantitative\" component. As Connellan and Zemke (1993) put it:\nLimitations of negative and positive feedback.\nWhile simple systems can sometimes be described as one or the other type, many systems with feedback loops cannot be so easily designated as simply positive or negative, and this is especially true when multiple loops are present.\nOther types of feedback.\nIn general, feedback systems can have many signals fed back and the feedback loop frequently contain mixtures of positive and negative feedback where positive and negative feedback can dominate at different frequencies or different points in the state space of a system.\nThe term bipolar feedback has been coined to refer to biological systems where positive and negative feedback systems can interact, the output of one affecting the input of another, and vice versa.\nSome systems with feedback can have very complex behaviors such as chaotic behaviors in non-linear systems, while others have much more predictable behaviors, such as those that are used to make and design digital systems.\nFeedback is used extensively in digital systems. For example, binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it.\nApplications.\nMathematics and dynamical systems.\nBy using feedback properties, the behavior of a system can be altered to meet the needs of an application; systems can be made stable, responsive or held constant. It is shown that dynamical systems with a feedback experience an adaptation to the edge of chaos.\nBiology.\nIn biological systems such as organisms, ecosystems, or the biosphere, most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions. The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. An example of this is insulin oscillations.\nBiological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, both positive and negative. As in other contexts, \"positive\" and \"negative\" do not imply that the feedback causes \"good\" or \"bad\" effects. A negative feedback loop is one that tends to slow down a process, whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it. The mirror neurons are part of a social feedback system, when an observed action is \"mirrored\" by the brain\u2014like a self-performed action.\nNormal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted molecules that act as mediators; failure of key feedback mechanisms in cancer disrupts tissue function.\nIn an injured or infected tissue, inflammatory mediators elicit feedback responses in cells, which alter gene expression, and change the groups of molecules expressed and secreted, including molecules that induce diverse cells to cooperate and restore tissue structure and function. This type of feedback is important because it enables coordination of immune responses and recovery from infections and injuries. During cancer, key elements of this feedback fail. This disrupts tissue function and immunity.\nMechanisms of feedback were first elucidated in bacteria, where a nutrient elicits changes in some of their metabolic functions.\nFeedback is also central to the operations of genes and gene regulatory networks. Repressor (see Lac repressor) and activator proteins are used to create genetic operons, which were identified by Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Jacques Monod in 1961 as \"feedback loops\". These feedback loops may be positive (as in the case of the coupling between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial cell), or negative (as is often the case in metabolic consumption).\nOn a larger scale, feedback can have a stabilizing effect on animal populations even when profoundly affected by external changes, although time lags in feedback response can give rise to predator-prey cycles.\nIn zymology, feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct or downstream in the metabolic pathway (see Allosteric regulation).\nThe hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis is largely controlled by positive and negative feedback, much of which is still unknown.\nIn psychology, the body receives a stimulus from the environment or internally that causes the release of hormones. Release of hormones then may cause more of those hormones to be released, causing a positive feedback loop. This cycle is also found in certain behaviour. For example, \"shame loops\" occur in people who blush easily. When they realize that they are blushing, they become even more embarrassed, which leads to further blushing, and so on.\nClimate science.\nThe climate system is characterized by strong positive and negative feedback loops between processes that affect the state of the atmosphere, ocean, and land. A simple example is the ice-albedo positive feedback loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground (of lower albedo), which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt.\nControl theory.\nFeedback is extensively used in control theory, using a variety of methods including state space (controls), full state feedback, and so forth. In the context of control theory, \"feedback\" is traditionally assumed to specify \"negative feedback\".\nThe most common general-purpose controller using a control-loop feedback mechanism is a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Heuristically, the terms of a PID controller can be interpreted as corresponding to time: the proportional term depends on the \"present\" error, the integral term on the accumulation of \"past\" errors, and the derivative term is a prediction of \"future\" error, based on current rate of change.\nEducation.\nFor feedback in the educational context, see corrective feedback.\nMechanical engineering.\nIn ancient times, the float valve was used to regulate the flow of water in Greek and Roman water clocks; similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in a carburettor and also used to regulate tank water level in the flush toilet.\nThe Dutch inventor Cornelius Drebbel (1572-1633) built thermostats (c1620) to control the temperature of chicken incubators and chemical furnaces. In 1745, the windmill was improved by blacksmith Edmund Lee, who added a fantail to keep the face of the windmill pointing into the wind. In 1787, Tom Mead regulated the rotation speed of a windmill by using a centrifugal pendulum to adjust the distance between the bedstone and the runner stone (i.e., to adjust the load).\nThe use of the centrifugal governor by James Watt in 1788 to regulate the speed of his steam engine was one factor leading to the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines also use float valves and pressure release valves as mechanical regulation devices. A mathematical analysis of Watt's governor was done by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868.\nThe \"Great Eastern\" was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in 1866 by John McFarlane Gray. Joseph Farcot coined the word \"servo\" in 1873 to describe steam-powered steering systems. Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns. Elmer Ambrose Sperry of the Sperry Corporation designed the first autopilot in 1912. Nicolas Minorsky published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in 1922 and described the PID controller.\nInternal combustion engines of the late 20th century employed mechanical feedback mechanisms such as the vacuum timing advance but mechanical feedback was replaced by electronic engine management systems once small, robust and powerful single-chip microcontrollers became affordable.\nElectronic engineering.\nThe use of feedback is widespread in the design of electronic components such as amplifiers, oscillators, and stateful logic circuit elements such as flip-flops and counters. Electronic feedback systems are also very commonly used to control mechanical, thermal and other physical processes.\nIf the signal is inverted on its way round the control loop, the system is said to have \"negative feedback\"; otherwise, the feedback is said to be \"positive\". Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the stability and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes. This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it. When this happens, the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in over-correction, causing the output to oscillate or \"hunt\". While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour, this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators.\nHarry Nyquist at Bell Labs derived the Nyquist stability criterion for determining the stability of feedback systems. An easier method, but less general, is to use Bode plots developed by Hendrik Bode to determine the gain margin and phase margin. Design to ensure stability often involves frequency compensation to control the location of the poles of the amplifier.\nElectronic feedback loops are used to control the output of electronic devices, such as amplifiers. A feedback loop is created when all or some portion of the output is fed back to the input. A device is said to be operating \"open loop\" if no output feedback is being employed and \"closed loop\" if feedback is being used.\nWhen two or more amplifiers are cross-coupled using positive feedback, complex behaviors can be created. These \"multivibrators\" are widely used and include:\nNegative feedback.\nA Negative feedback occurs when the fed-back output signal has a relative phase of 180\u00b0 with respect to the input signal (upside down). This situation is sometimes referred to as being \"out of phase\", but that term also is used to indicate other phase separations, as in \"90\u00b0 out of phase\". Negative feedback can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted fluctuations. In feedback amplifiers, this correction is generally for waveform distortion reduction or to establish a specified gain level. A general expression for the gain of a negative feedback amplifier is the asymptotic gain model.\nPositive feedback.\nPositive feedback occurs when the fed-back signal is in phase with the input signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input signal to the point where the output of the device oscillates between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce hysteresis into a circuit. This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make bistable circuits for volatile storage of information.\nThe loud squeals that sometimes occurs in audio systems, PA systems, and rock music are known as audio feedback. If a microphone is in front of a loudspeaker that it is connected to, sound that the microphone picks up comes out of the speaker, and is picked up by the microphone and re-amplified. If the loop gain is sufficient, howling or squealing at the maximum power of the amplifier is possible.\nOscillator.\nAn electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave. Oscillators convert direct current (DC) from a power supply to an alternating current signal. They are widely used in many electronic devices. Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters, clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games.\nOscillators are often characterized by the frequency of their output signal:\nOscillators designed to produce a high-power AC output from a DC supply are usually called inverters.\nThere are two main types of electronic oscillator: the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or relaxation oscillator.\nLatches and flip-flops.\nA latch or a flip-flop is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.\nLatches and flip-flops are used as data storage elements. Such data storage can be used for storage of \"state\", and such a circuit is described as sequential logic. When used in a finite-state machine, the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.\nFlip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or clocked (synchronous or edge-triggered). Although the term flip-flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits, in modern usage it is common to reserve the term \"flip-flop\" exclusively for discussing clocked circuits; the simple ones are commonly called \"latches\".\nUsing this terminology, a latch is level-sensitive, whereas a flip-flop is edge-sensitive. That is, when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent, while a flip flop's output only changes on a single type (positive going or negative going) of clock edge.\nSoftware.\nFeedback loops provide generic mechanisms for controlling the running, maintenance, and evolution of software and computing systems. Feedback-loops are important models in the engineering of adaptive software, as they define the behaviour of the interactions among the control elements over the adaptation process, to guarantee system properties at run-time. Feedback loops and foundations of control theory have been successfully applied to computing systems. In particular, they have been applied to the development of products such as IBM's Universal Database server and IBM Tivoli. From a software perspective, the autonomic (MAPE, monitor analyze plan execute) loop proposed by researchers of IBM is another valuable contribution to the application of feedback loops to the control of dynamic properties and the design and evolution of autonomic software systems.\nUser interface design.\nFeedback is also a useful design principle for designing user interfaces.\nVideo feedback.\nVideo feedback is the video equivalent of acoustic feedback. It involves a loop between a video camera input and a video output, e.g., a television screen or monitor. Aiming the camera at the display produces a complex video image based on the feedback.\nEconomics and finance.\nThe stock market is an example of a system prone to oscillatory \"hunting\", governed by positive and negative feedback resulting from cognitive and emotional factors among market participants. For example:\nGeorge Soros used the word \"reflexivity,\" to describe feedback in the financial markets and developed an investment theory based on this principle.\nThe conventional economic equilibrium model of supply and demand supports only ideal linear negative feedback and was heavily criticized by Paul Ormerod in his book \"The Death of Economics\", which, in turn, was criticized by traditional economists. This book was part of a change of perspective as economists started to recognise that chaos theory applied to nonlinear feedback systems including financial markets."}
{"id": "11547", "revid": "1012810263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11547", "title": "Furigana", "text": " is a Japanese reading aid, consisting of smaller kana or syllabic characters, printed next to kanji (ideographic characters) or other characters to indicate their pronunciation. It is one type of ruby text. Furigana is also known as and in Japanese. In modern Japanese, it is usually used to gloss rare kanji, to clarify rare, nonstandard or ambiguous kanji readings, or in children's or learners' materials. Before the post-World War II script reforms, it was more widespread.\nFurigana is most often written in hiragana, though katakana, Roman alphabet letters or other kanji can also be used in certain special cases. In vertical text, \"tategaki\", the furigana is placed to the right of the line of text; in horizontal text, \"yokogaki\", it is placed above the line of text, as illustrated below.\nor\nThese examples spell the word \"kanji\", which is made up of two kanji characters: (\"kan\", written in hiragana as ) and (\"ji\", written in hiragana as ).\nAppearance.\nFurigana may be added by character, in which case the furigana character(s) that correspond to a kanji are centered over that kanji; or by word or phrase, in which case the entire furigana text is centered over several kanji characters, even if the kanji do not represent equal shares of the kana needed to write them. The latter method is more common, especially since some words in Japanese have unique pronunciations (\"jukujikun\") that are not related to readings of any of the characters the word is written with.\nFurigana fonts are generally sized so that two kana characters fit naturally over one kanji; when more kana are required, this is resolved either by adjusting the furigana by using a condensed font (narrowing the kana), or by adjusting the kanji by intercharacter spacing (adding spaces around the kanji). In case an isolated kanji character has a long reading\u2014for example (where reads , \"tazusa\")\u2014the furigana may instead spill over into the space next to the neighboring kana characters, without condensing or changing spacing. Three-kana readings are not uncommon, particularly due to \"y\u014don\" with a long vowel, such as ; five kana are required for and six for , the longest of any character in the Joyo kanji. Very long readings also occur for certain kanji or symbols which have a \"gairaigo\" reading; the word \"centimeter\" is generally written as \"cm\" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space) and has the seven-kana reading (\"senchim\u0113toru\") (it can also be written as the kanji , though this is very rare); another common example is \"%\" (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading (\"p\u0101sento\"). These cause severe spacing problems due to length and these words being used as units (hence closely associated with the preceding figure).\nWhen it is necessary to distinguish between native Japanese \"kun'yomi\" pronunciations and Chinese-derived \"on'yomi\" pronunciations, for example in kanji dictionaries, the Japanese pronunciations are written in hiragana, and the Chinese pronunciations are written in katakana. However, this distinction is really only important in dictionaries and other reference works. In ordinary prose, the script chosen will usually be hiragana. The one general exception to this is \"modern\" Chinese place names, personal names, and (occasionally) food names\u2014these will often be written with kanji, and katakana used for the furigana; in more casual writing these are simply written in katakana, as borrowed words. Occasionally this style is also used for loanwords from other languages (especially English). For example, the kanji (literally \"one horn beast\") might be glossed with katakana , \"yunik\u014dn\", to show the pronunciation of the loanword \"unicorn\", which is unrelated to the normal reading of the kanji. Generally, though, such loanwords are just written in straight katakana.\nThe distinction between regular kana and the smaller character forms (y\u014don and sokuon), which are used in regular orthography to mark such things as gemination and palatalization, is often not made in furigana: for example, the usual hiragana spelling of the word (\"kyakka\") is , but in furigana it might be written . This was especially common in old-fashioned movable type printing when smaller fonts were not available. Nowadays, with computer-based printing systems, this occurs less frequently.\nAlignment rules in word processing or typesetting.\nVarious word processing or typesetting software programs, such as Microsoft Word, Adobe InDesign, Adobe InCopy, etc. have features for adding ruby text, especially Japanese furigana. Among formatting features are different rules for aligning the kana over or to the right of the base text, usually either when the base text string is longer than the furigana string or vice versa. Extra spaces may be needed depending on the size of the shorter string (either the ruby string or the base string) relatively to the longer one.\nUsage.\nFurigana are most commonly used in works for children, who may not have sufficiently advanced reading skills to recognize the kanji, but can understand the word when written phonetically in hiragana. Because children learn hiragana before katakana, in books for very young children, there are hiragana furigana next to the katakana characters. It is common to use furigana on all kanji characters in works for young children. This is called in Japanese.\nNumeric characters used for counting (e.g. \"ni-hon\" \"two long things\"; \"futatsume\" \"second\"; \"dai-ni kan\" \"book 2\"; \"ni-p\u0113ji\" \"page 2\"; etc.) are usually not tagged with furigana. Exceptions include a few cases such as \u4e00\u4eba/\uff11\u4eba \"hitori\" \"one person\" and \u4e8c\u4eba/\uff12\u4eba \"futari\" \"two people\", which may be tagged with separate kana for each character (/), or non-separated kana for the whole word (/), depending on the style of the publisher in question; or characters for numerals greater than 1,000 (\u5343), such as \u4e07 (10,000), \u5104 (100,000,000), etc. Numeric words in established compounds (e.g. \"ippo\" \"step\"; \"hitome\" \"sight; attention\"), however, are generally tagged with furigana.\nMany children's, sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga use furigana (again however, rarely on numerals). Sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga tend to have furigana for all non-numeric characters, while children's manga, such as \"Doraemon\", may also ignore furigana on elementary-grade kanji. Seinen and josei manga ignores furigana most of the time, even on the names of the characters if they're common names, although some publishers may still routinely use furigana for the first mentions of important characters' names in a volume or chapter. There are also books with a phonetic guide (mainly in hiragana but sometimes in r\u014dmaji) for Japanese learners, which may be bilingual or Japanese only. These are popular with foreigners wishing to master Japanese faster and enjoy reading Japanese short stories, novels or articles.\nDue to the small type used for furigana, for maximum readability, some manga publishers may use regular kana instead of small kana. For example, \u306f\u3063\u3057\u3093 \"hasshin\" may be spelled \u306f\u3064\u3057\u3093 *\"hatsushin\" instead.\nSome websites and tools exist which provide a phonetic guide for Japanese web pages (in hiragana, r\u014dmaji or kiriji); these are popular with both Japanese children and foreign Japanese learners.\nIn works aimed at adult Japanese speakers, furigana may be used on a word written in uncommon kanji; in the mass media, they are generally used on words containing non-J\u014dy\u014d kanji.\nFurigana commonly appear alongside kanji names and their romanizations on signs for railway stations, even if the pronunciation of the kanji is commonly known. Furigana also appear often on maps to show the pronunciation of unusual place names.\nBefore the war, youths might arguably have been almost illiterate if not for furigana.\nNames.\nJapanese names are usually written in kanji. Because there are many possible readings for kanji names, including special name-only readings called nanori, furigana are often used to give the readings of names. On Japanese official forms, where the name is to be written, there is always an adjacent column for the name to be written in furigana. Usually katakana is preferred.\nFurigana may also be used for foreign names written in kanji. Chinese and Korean names are the most common examples: Chinese names are usually pronounced with Japanese readings and the pronunciation written in hiragana, while Korean names are usually pronounced with Korean readings and the pronunciation written in katakana. Furigana may also be necessary in the rare case where names are transliterated into kanji from other languages (e.g. soccer star Ruy Ramos and politician Marutei Tsurunen.)\nLanguage learning.\nKanji and kanji compounds are often presented with furigana in Japanese-language textbooks for non-native speakers.\nFurigana are also often used in foreign-language textbooks for Japanese learners to indicate pronunciation. The words are written in the original foreign script, such as hangul for Korean, and furigana is used to indicate the pronunciation. According to Ministry of Education guidelines, and the opinions of educators, the use of Japanese furigana should be avoided in English teaching due to the differences in pronunciation between English and Japanese. For instance, the word \"birthdate\" might be glossed in furigana as (\"b\u0101sudeito\"), which corresponds to an imperfect pronunciation.\nPunning and double meaning.\nSome writers use furigana to represent slang pronunciations, particularly those that would be difficult to understand without the kanji to provide their meaning.\nAnother use is to write the kanji for something which had been previously referenced, but write furigana for () or (), meaning \"that\". This means that the actual word used was \"that\", but the kanji clarify for the reader what \"that\" refers to. Another way to use it is to tag () onto words or names for places, to convey something along the line of, for example, \"here (at this hospital)\" () or \"here (in LA)\" ().\nFurigana unrelated to the kanji they are assigned to are quite often used to convey certain effects, rather than to denote a phonetic guide, especially in manga, anime, and games both video and tabletop. This usage is known as \"gikun\" (see also Kanji#Special readings). The specific types of effects vary: furigana could be used to visually reinforce complex ideas without having to use long expressions; to annotate strange, foreign, rarely seen text; to use more artistic or more explanatory spellings for regular words (see Kanji#Gikun); or simply for shorthand for base text abbreviation, thanks to the small type of furigana. For example, the word \"nightmare\" may be assigned with \"shinjitsu\" \"truth\" rather than its true reading, \"akumu\", to convey the meaning of \"nightmarish truth\". Some authors may even use furigana that means the opposite of what the base text does to reinforce an effect, such as the complicated relationship between characters. For example, \"shin'y\u016b\" \"close friend\" may be tagged with \"raibaru\" \"rival\", to mean \"you're my rival, but also my friend\"; or conversely, \"k\u014dtekishu\" \"eternal rival\" may be tagged with \"tomo\" \"friend\". Some manga make use of the furigana renditions of foreign words (especially obscure ones) as the intended reading of a term, and the more familiar kanji for the meaning of such a term. For example, may be assigned with \"burakku majikku\", the rendition of the English \"black magic\", to convey a foreign, exotic feel; with \"sut\u0113shon\" \"station\"; with \"han\u012bm\u016bn\" \"honeymoon\". This is sometimes done conversely, for example, by using \"kissu\" \"kiss\", the more familiar term, as furigana to convey meaning, and \"b\u0113ze\" \"\", the exotic term, as base text. For shorthand purposes, abbreviations such as may be used to make the regular kana spelling that is too long smaller type.\nIn karaoke it is extremely common for furigana to be placed on the song lyrics. The song lyrics are often written in kanji pronounced quite differently from the furigana. The furigana version is used for pronunciation.\nAlso, because the kanji represent meaning while the furigana represent sound, one can combine the two to create puns or indicate meanings of foreign words. One might write the kanji for \"blue\", but use katakana to write the pronunciation of the English word \"blue\"; this may be done, for example, in Japanese subtitles on foreign films, where it can help associate the written Japanese with the sounds actually being spoken by the actors, or it may be used in a translation of a work of fiction to enable the translator to preserve the original sound of a proper name (such as \"Firebolt\" in the Harry Potter series) in japan, while simultaneously indicating its meaning with kanji. A similar practice is used in native fiction to clarify extended meanings. For example, in a work of science fiction, some astronaut could use the word , \"furusato\", meaning \"my hometown\", when referring to planet Earth. To clarify that for the reader, the word \"furusato\" (hometown) might be written in hiragana over the kanji for \"chikyuu\" (Earth).\nOther Japanese reading aids.\nOkurigana.\nOkurigana are kana that appear inline at normal size following kanji stems, typically to complete and to inflect adjectives and verbs. In this use they may also help to disambiguate kanji with multiple readings; for example, (, \"agaru\") vs. (, \"noboru\"). Unlike furigana, the use of okurigana is a mandatory part of the written language.\nKunten.\nIn the written style known as \"kanbun\", which is the Japanese approximation of Classical Chinese, small marks called \"kunten\" are sometimes added as reading aids. Unlike furigana, which indicate pronunciation, \"kunten\" indicate Japanese grammatical structures absent from the \"kanbun\", and also show how words should be reordered to fit Japanese sentence structure.\nFurikanji.\nFurigana are sometimes also used to indicate meaning, rather than pronunciation. Over the foreign text, smaller-sized Japanese words, in kana or kanji, corresponding to the \"meaning\" of the foreign words, effectively translate it in place. While rare now, some late 19th\u2013early 20th century authors used kanji as furigana for loanwords written in katakana.

He assumed the title of Emperor of Austria in response to the coronation of Napoleon as Emperor of the French. Soon after Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, Francis abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor. He was King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia. He also served as the first president of the German Confederation following its establishment in 1815.\nFrancis II continued his leading role as an opponent of Napoleonic France in the Napoleonic Wars, and suffered several more defeats after Austerlitz. The wedding of his daughter Marie Louise of Austria to Napoleon on 10 March 1810 was arguably his severest personal defeat. After the abdication of Napoleon following the War of the Sixth Coalition, Austria participated as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna, which was largely dominated by Francis's chancellor Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich culminating in a new European map and the restoration of Francis's ancient dominions (except the Holy Roman Empire which was dissolved). Due to the establishment of the Concert of Europe, which largely resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies, Francis became viewed as a reactionary later in his reign.\nFrancis II's grandchildren include Napoleon II (Napoleon's only legitimate son), Franz Joseph I of Austria, Maximilian I of Mexico, Maria II of Portugal and Pedro II of Brazil.\nEarly life.\nFrancis was a son of Emperor Leopold II (1747\u20131792) and his wife Maria Luisa of Spain (1745\u20131792), daughter of Charles III of Spain. Francis was born in Florence, the capital of Tuscany, where his father reigned as Grand Duke from 1765 to 1790. Though he had a happy childhood surrounded by his many siblings, his family knew Francis was likely to be a future Emperor (his uncle Joseph had no surviving issue from either of his two marriages), and so in 1784 the young Archduke was sent to the Imperial Court in Vienna to educate and prepare him for his future role.\nEmperor Joseph II himself took charge of Francis's development. His disciplinarian regime was a stark contrast to the indulgent Florentine Court of Leopold. The Emperor wrote that Francis was \"stunted in growth\", \"backward in bodily dexterity and deportment\", and \"neither more nor less than a spoiled mother's child.\" Joseph concluded that \"the manner in which he was treated for upwards of sixteen years could not but have confirmed him in the delusion that the preservation of his own person was the only thing of importance.\"\nJoseph's martinet method of improving the young Francis was \"fear and unpleasantness.\" The young Archduke was isolated, the reasoning being that this would make him more self-sufficient as it was felt by Joseph that Francis \"failed to lead himself, to do his own thinking.\" Nonetheless, Francis greatly admired his uncle, if rather feared him. To complete his training, Francis was sent to join an army regiment in Hungary and he settled easily into the routine of military life.\nAfter the death of Joseph II in 1790, Francis's father became Emperor. He had an early taste of power while acting as Leopold's deputy in Vienna while the incoming Emperor traversed the Empire attempting to win back those alienated by his brother's policies. The strain told on Leopold and by the winter of 1791, he became ill. He gradually worsened throughout early 1792; on the afternoon of 1 March Leopold died, at the relatively young age of 44. Francis, just past his 24th birthday, was now Emperor, much sooner than he had expected.\nEmperor.\nAs the head of the Holy Roman Empire and the ruler of the vast multi-ethnic Habsburg hereditary lands, Francis felt threatened by the French revolutionaries and later Napoleon's expansionism as well as their social and political reforms which were being exported throughout Europe in the wake of the conquering French armies. Francis had a fraught relationship with France. His aunt Marie Antoinette, the wife of Louis XVI and Queen consort of France, was guillotined by the revolutionaries in 1793, at the beginning of his reign, although, on the whole, he was indifferent to her fate.\nLater, he led Holy Roman Empire into the French Revolutionary Wars. He briefly commanded the Allied forces during the Flanders Campaign of 1794 before handing over command to his brother Archduke Charles. He was later defeated by Napoleon. By the Treaty of Campo Formio, he ceded the left bank of the Rhine to France in exchange for Venice and Dalmatia. He again fought against France during the Second.\nOn 11 August 1804, in response to Napoleon crowning himself as emperor of the French earlier that year, he announced that he would henceforth assume the title of hereditary emperor of Austria as Francis I, a move that technically was illegal in terms of imperial law. Yet Napoleon had agreed beforehand and therefore it happened.\nDuring the War of the Third Coalition, the Austrian forces met a crushing defeat at Austerlitz, and Francis had to agree to the Treaty of Pressburg, which greatly weakened Austria and brought about the final collapse of Holy Roman Empire. In July 1806, under massive pressure from France, Bavaria and fifteen other German states ratified the statutes founding the Confederation of the Rhine, with Napoleon designated Protector, and they announced to the Imperial Diet their intention to leave the Empire with immediate effect. Then, on 22 July, Napoleon issued an ultimatum to Francis demanding that he abdicate as Holy Roman Emperor by 10 August. Five days later, Francis bowed to the inevitable and, without mentioning the ultimatum, affirmed that since the Peace of Pressburg he has tried his best to fulfil his duties as emperor but that circumstances had convinced him that he could no longer rule according to his oath of office, the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine making that impossible. He added that \"we hereby decree that we regard the bond which until now tied us to the states of the Empire as dissolved\" in effect dissolving the empire. At the same time he declared the complete and formal withdrawal of his hereditary lands from imperial jurisdiction. After that date, he reigned as Francis I, Emperor of Austria.\nIn 1809, Francis attacked France again, hoping to take advantage of the Peninsular War embroiling Napoleon in Spain. He was again defeated, and this time forced to ally himself with Napoleon, ceding territory to the Empire, joining the Continental System, and wedding his daughter Marie-Louise to the Emperor. The Napoleonic wars drastically weakened Austria, making it entirely landlocked and threatened its preeminence among the states of Germany, a position that it would eventually cede to the Kingdom of Prussia.\nIn 1813, for the fourth and final time, Austria turned against France and joined Great Britain, Russia, Prussia and Sweden in their war against Napoleon. Austria played a major role in the final defeat of France\u2014in recognition of this, Francis, represented by Clemens von Metternich, presided over the Congress of Vienna, helping to form the Concert of Europe and the Holy Alliance, ushering in an era of conservatism in Europe. The German Confederation, a loose association of Central European states was created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to organize the surviving states of the Holy Roman Empire. The Congress was a personal triumph for Francis, who hosted the assorted dignitaries in comfort, though Francis undermined his allies Tsar Alexander and Frederick William III of Prussia by negotiating a secret treaty with the restored French king Louis XVIII.\nDomestic policy.\nThe violent events of the French Revolution impressed themselves deeply into the mind of Francis (as well as all other European monarchs), and he came to distrust radicalism in any form. In 1794, a \"Jacobin\" conspiracy was discovered in the Austrian and Hungarian armies. The leaders were put on trial, but the verdicts only skirted the perimeter of the conspiracy. Francis's brother Alexander Leopold (at that time Palatine of Hungary) wrote to the Emperor admitting \"Although we have caught a lot of the culprits, we have not really got to the bottom of this business yet.\" Nonetheless, two officers heavily implicated in the conspiracy were hanged and gibbeted, while numerous others were sentenced to imprisonment (many of whom died from the conditions).\nFrancis was from his experiences suspicious and set up an extensive network of police spies and censors to monitor dissent (in this he was following his father's lead, as the Grand Duchy of Tuscany had the most effective secret police in Europe). Even his family did not escape attention. His brothers, the Archdukes Charles and Johann had their meetings and activities spied upon. Censorship was also prevalent. The author Franz Grillparzer, a Habsburg patriot, had one play suppressed solely as a \"precautionary\" measure. When Grillparzer met the censor responsible, he asked him what was objectionable about the work. The censor replied, \"Oh, nothing at all. But I thought to myself, 'One can never tell'.\"\nIn military affairs Francis had allowed his brother, the Archduke Charles, extensive control over the army during the Napoleonic wars. Yet, distrustful of allowing any individual too much power, he otherwise maintained the separation of command functions between the Hofkriegsrat and his field commanders. In the later years of his reign he limited military spending, requiring it not exceed forty million florins per year; because of inflation this resulted in inadequate funding, with the army's share of the budget shrinking from half in 1817 to only twenty-three percent in 1830.\nFrancis presented himself as an open and approachable monarch (he regularly set aside two mornings each week to meet his imperial subjects, regardless of status, by appointment in his office, even speaking to them in their own language), but his will was sovereign. In 1804, he had no compunction about announcing that through his authority as Holy Roman Emperor, he declared he was now Emperor of Austria (at the time a geographical term that had little resonance). Two years later, Francis personally wound up the moribund Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Both actions were of dubious constitutional legality.\nTo increase patriotic sentiment during the war with France, the anthem \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\" was composed in 1797 to be sung as the Kaiserhymne to music by Joseph Haydn. The lyrics were adapted for later Emperors and the music lives on as the Deutschlandlied.\nLater years.\nOn 2 March 1835, 43 years and a day after his father's death, Francis died in Vienna of a sudden fever aged 67, in the presence of many of his family and with all the religious comforts. His funeral was magnificent, with his Viennese subjects respectfully filing past his coffin in the chapel of Hofburg Palace for three days. Francis was interred in the traditional resting place of Habsburg monarchs, the Kapuziner Imperial Crypt in Vienna's Neue Markt Square. He is buried in tomb number 57, surrounded by his four wives.\nFrancis passed on a main point in the political testament he left for his son and heir Ferdinand to; \"preserve unity in the family and regard it as one of the highest goods.\" In many portraits (particularly those painted by Peter Fendi) he was portrayed as the patriarch of a loving family, surrounded by his children and grandchildren.\nMarriages.\nFrancis II married four times:\nChildren.\nFrom his first wife Elisabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg, one daughter, and his second wife Maria Teresa of the Two Sicilies, eight daughters and four sons:\nChildren of Francis II\nTitles, honours and heraldry.\nTitles.\nFrom 1806 he used the titles: \"We, Francis the First, by the Grace of God Emperor of Austria; King of Jerusalem, Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia and Lodomeria; Archduke of Austria; Duke of Lorraine, Salzburg, W\u00fcrzburg, Franconia, Styria, Carinthia and Carniola; Grand Duke of Cracow; Grand Prince of Transylvania; Margrave of Moravia; Duke of Sandomir, Masovia, Lublin, Upper and Lower Silesia, Auschwitz and Zator, Teschen and Friule; Prince of Berchtesgaden and Mergentheim; Princely Count of Habsburg, Gorizia and Gradisca and of the Tirol; and Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and in Istria\"."}

He is best known for the invention of cordite as a replacement for gunpowder in firearms.\nEducation.\nBorn in London as son of Johann Leopold Abel, Abel studied chemistry at the Royal Polytechnic Institution and in 1845 became one of the original 26 students of A. W. von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry. In 1852 he was appointed lecturer in chemistry at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, succeeding Michael Faraday, who had held that post since 1829.\nEarly career.\nFrom 1854 until 1888 Abel served as ordnance chemist at the Chemical Establishment of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, establishing himself as the leading British authority on explosives. Three years later was appointed chemist to the War Department and chemical referee to the government. During his tenure of this office, which lasted until 1888, he carried out a large amount of work in connection with the chemistry of explosives.\nNotable work.\nOne of the most important of his investigations had to do with the manufacture of guncotton, and he developed a process, consisting essentially of reducing the nitrated cotton to fine pulp, which enabled it to be safely manufactured and at the same time yielded the product in a form that increased its usefulness. This work to an important extent prepared the way for the \"smokeless powders\" which came into general use towards the end of the 19th century; cordite, the type adopted by the British government in 1891, was invented jointly by him and Sir James Dewar. He and Dewar were unsuccessfully sued by Alfred Nobel over infringement of Nobel's patent for a similar explosive called ballistite, the case finally being resolved in the House of Lords in 1895. He also extensively researched the behaviour of black powder when ignited, with the Scottish physicist Sir Andrew Noble. At the request of the British government, he devised the Abel test, a means of determining the flash point of petroleum products. His first instrument, the open-test apparatus, was specified in an Act of Parliament in 1868 for officially specifying petroleum products. It was superseded in August 1879 by the much more reliable Abel close-test instrument. Under his leadership, first, guncotton was developed at Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills, patented in 1865, then, the propellant cordite, patented in 1889. In electricity, Abel studied the construction of electrical fuses and other applications of electricity to warlike purposes.\nLeadership and honours.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1860 and received their Royal Medal in 1887. He was president of the Chemical Society (1875\u20137), of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (then the Society of Telegraph Engineers) (1877), of the Institute of Chemistry (1881\u20132) and of the Society of Chemical Industry (1883). He was also president of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1891 and was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal in 1897 for his work on problems of steel manufacture. He was awarded the Telford Medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1879.\nHe was made a Commander of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1877. and knighted on 20 April 1883 \nHe took an important part in the work of the Inventions Exhibition (London) in 1885, and in 1887 became organizing secretary and first director of the Imperial Institute, a position he held till his death in 1902. He was Rede Lecturer and received an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University in 1888. He was upgraded Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 3 February 1891, created a baronet, of Cadogan Place in the Parish of Chelsea in the County of London, on 25 May 1893 and made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) on 8 March 1901.\nAbel died at his residence in Whitehall Court, London, on 6 September 1902, aged 75, and was buried in Nunhead Cemetery, London. The baronetcy became extinct on his death.\nFamily.\nAbel married twice; first to Sarah Blanch, daughter of James Blanch, of Bristol; secondly after his first wife's death to Giulietta de La Feuillade. He left no children.\nBooks.\nHe also wrote several articles in the ninth edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"."}

{"id": "11555", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11555", "title": "Fluorescence", "text": "Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. It is a form of luminescence. In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. The most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and thus invisible to the human eye, while the emitted light is in the visible region, which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can be seen only when exposed to UV light. Fluorescent materials cease to glow nearly immediately when the radiation source stops, unlike phosphorescent materials, which continue to emit light for some time after.\nFluorescence has many practical applications, including mineralogy, gemology, medicine, chemical sensors (fluorescence spectroscopy), fluorescent labelling, dyes, biological detectors, cosmic-ray detection, vacuum fluorescent displays, and cathode-ray tubes. Its most common everyday application is in energy-saving fluorescent lamps and LED lamps, where fluorescent coatings are used to convert short-wavelength UV light or blue light into longer-wavelength yellow light, thereby mimicking the warm light of energy-inefficient incandescent lamps.\nFluorescence also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in many biological forms across all kingdoms of life. This is sometimes referred to as \"biofluorescence\" to indicate that the fluorophore derives from a living organism (as opposed to artifically adding a dye or stain). However, in many cases the substance may be fluorescent even if the organism is dead, thus \"fluorescence\" is still the preferred term.\nHistory.\nAn early observation of fluorescence was described in 1560 by Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan and in 1565 by Nicol\u00e1s Monardes in the infusion known as \"lignum nephriticum\" (Latin for \"kidney wood\"). It was derived from the wood of two tree species, \"Pterocarpus indicus\" and \"Eysenhardtia polystachya\". The chemical compound responsible for this fluorescence is matlaline, which is the oxidation product of one of the flavonoids found in this wood.\nIn 1819, Edward D. Clarke and in 1822 Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy described fluorescence in fluorites, Sir David Brewster described the phenomenon for chlorophyll in 1833 and Sir John Herschel did the same for quinine in 1845.\nIn his 1852 paper on the \"Refrangibility\" (wavelength change) of light, George Gabriel Stokes described the ability of fluorspar and uranium glass to change invisible light beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum into blue light. He named this phenomenon \"fluorescence\" : \"I am almost inclined to coin a word, and call the appearance \"fluorescence\", from fluor-spar [i.e., fluorite], as the analogous term \"opalescence\" is derived from the name of a mineral.\" The name was derived from the mineral fluorite (calcium difluoride), some examples of which contain traces of divalent europium, which serves as the fluorescent activator to emit blue light. In a key experiment he used a prism to isolate ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and observed blue light emitted by an ethanol solution of quinine exposed by it.\nPhysical principles.\nMechanism.\nFluorescence occurs when an excited molecule, atom, or nanostructure, relaxes to a lower energy state (possibly the ground state) through emission of a photon. It may have been directly excited from the ground state S0 to a singlet state S2 from the ground state by absorption of a photon of energy formula_1 and subsequently emits a photon of a lower energy formula_2 as it relaxes to state S1:\nIn each case the photon energy formula_5 is proportional to its frequency formula_6 according to formula_7, where formula_8 is Planck's constant. The ending state S1, if not the ground state, may then lose its remaining energy through further fluorescent emission and/or \"non-radiative relaxation\" in which the energy is dissipated as heat (phonons). When the excited state is a metastable (long-lived) state, then that fluorescent transition is rather termed phosphorescence.\nRelaxation from an excited state can also occur through transferring some or all of its energy to a second molecule through an interaction known as fluorescence quenching. Molecular oxygen (O2) is an extremely efficient quencher of fluorescence just because of its unusual triplet ground state.\nIn all cases, the emitted light has a lower energy (lower frequency, longer wavelength) than the absorbed radiation; the difference in these energies is known as the Stokes shift. In some cases under intense illumination it is possible for one electron to absorb two photons allowing for the emission of radiation of a \"higher\" photon energy (shorter wavelength) than the absorbed radiation; such two-photon absorption is not referred to as fluorescence. A molecule that is excited through light absorption or other process (e.g. from a chemical reaction) can transfer its energy to a second 'sensitized' molecule, raising it to an excited state from which it will then fluoresce.\nQuantum yield.\nThe fluorescence quantum yield gives the efficiency of the fluorescence process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.\nThe maximum possible fluorescence quantum yield is 1.0 (100%); each photon absorbed results in a photon emitted. Compounds with quantum yields of 0.10 are still considered quite fluorescent. Another way to define the quantum yield of fluorescence is by the rate of excited state decay:\nwhere formula_11 is the rate constant of spontaneous emission of radiation and\nis the sum of all rates of excited state decay. Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are, therefore, often called \"non-radiative rates\", which can include:\ndynamic collisional quenching, near-field dipole-dipole interaction (or resonance energy transfer), internal conversion, and intersystem crossing. Thus, if the rate of any pathway changes, both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield will be affected.\nFluorescence quantum yields are measured by comparison to a standard. The quinine salt \"quinine sulfate\" in a sulfuric acid solution was regarded as the most common fluorescence standard, however, a recent study revealed that the fluorescence quantum yield of this solution is strongly affected by the temperature, and should no longer be used as the standard solution. The quinine in 0.1M perchloric acid (\u03a6=0.60) shows no temperature dependence up to 45\u00b0C, therefore it can be considered as a reliable standard solution.\nLifetime.\nThe fluorescence lifetime refers to the average time the molecule stays in its excited state before emitting a photon. Fluorescence typically follows first-order kinetics:\nwhere formula_14 is the concentration of excited state molecules at time formula_15, formula_16 is the initial concentration and formula_17 is the decay rate or the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime. This is an instance of exponential decay. Various radiative and non-radiative processes can de-populate the excited state. In such case the total decay rate is the sum over all rates:\nwhere formula_19 is the total decay rate, formula_20 the radiative decay rate and formula_21 the non-radiative decay rate. It is similar to a first-order chemical reaction in which the first-order rate constant is the sum of all of the rates (a parallel kinetic model). If the rate of spontaneous emission, or any of the other rates are fast, the lifetime is short. For commonly used fluorescent compounds, typical excited state decay times for photon emissions with energies from the UV to near infrared are within the range of 0.5 to 20 nanoseconds. The fluorescence lifetime is an important parameter for practical applications of fluorescence such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy.\nJablonski diagram.\nThe Jablonski diagram describes most of the relaxation mechanisms for excited state molecules. The diagram alongside shows how fluorescence occurs due to the relaxation of certain excited electrons of a molecule.\nFluorescence anisotropy.\nFluorophores are more likely to be excited by photons if the transition moment of the fluorophore is parallel to the electric vector of the photon. The polarization of the emitted light will also depend on the transition moment. The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the fluorophore molecule. For fluorophores in solution this means that the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate how freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.\nFluorescence anisotropy can be defined quantitatively as\nwhere formula_23 is the emitted intensity parallel to polarization of the excitation light and formula_24 is the emitted intensity perpendicular to the polarization of the excitation light.\nFluorence.\nStrongly fluorescent pigments often have an unusual appearance which is often described colloquially as a \"neon color\" (originally \"day-glo\" in the late 1960s, early 1970s). This phenomenon was termed \"Farbenglut\" by Hermann von Helmholtz and \"fluorence\" by Ralph M. Evans. It is generally thought to be related to the high brightness of the color relative to what it would be as a component of white. Fluorescence shifts energy in the incident illumination from shorter wavelengths to longer (such as blue to yellow) and thus can make the fluorescent color appear brighter (more saturated) than it could possibly be by reflection alone.\nRules.\nThere are several general rules that deal with fluorescence. Each of the following rules has exceptions but they are useful guidelines for understanding fluorescence (these rules do not necessarily apply to two-photon absorption).\nKasha's rule.\nKasha's rule dictates that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of exciting radiation. This occurs because excited molecules usually decay to the lowest vibrational level of the excited state before fluorescence emission takes place. The Kasha\u2013Vavilov rule does not always apply and is violated severely in many simple molecules. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, would be that the fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation.\nMirror image rule.\nFor many fluorophores the absorption spectrum is a mirror image of the emission spectrum. This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the Franck\u2013Condon principle which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus does not move and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state.\nStokes shift.\nIn general, emitted fluorescence light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light. This phenomenon, known as Stokes shift, is due to energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed and when a new one is emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.\nIn nature.\nThere are many natural compounds that exhibit fluorescence, and they have a number of applications. Some deep-sea animals, such as the greeneye, have fluorescent structures.\nCompared to bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.\nFluorescence.\nFluorescence is the temporary absorption of electromagnetic wavelengths from the visible light spectrum by fluorescent molecules, and the subsequent emission of light at a lower energy level. When it occurs in a living organism, it is sometimes called biofluorescence. This causes the light that is emitted to be a different color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an electron, raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescence light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, pink, orange, red, green, or purple. Fluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence. Pumpkin toadlets that live in the Brazilian Atlantic forest are fluorescent.\nBioluminescence.\nBioluminescence differs from fluorescence in that it is the natural production of light by chemical reactions within an organism, whereas fluorescence is the absorption and reemission of light from the environment. Fireflies and anglerfish are two examples of bioluminescent organisms. To add to the potential confusion, some organisms are both bioluminescent and fluorescent, like the sea pansy Renilla reniformis, where bioluminescence serves as the light source for fluorescence.\nPhosphorescence.\nPhosphorescence is similar to fluorescence in its requirement of light wavelengths as a provider of excitation energy. The difference here lies in the relative stability of the energized electron. Unlike with fluorescence, in phosphorescence the electron retains stability, emitting light that continues to \"glow-in-the-dark\" even after the stimulating light source has been removed. For example, glow-in-the-dark stickers are phosphorescent, but there are no truly \"biophosphorescent\" animals known.\nMechanisms.\nEpidermal chromatophores.\nPigment cells that exhibit fluorescence are called fluorescent chromatophores, and function somatically similar to regular chromatophores. These cells are dendritic, and contain pigments called fluorosomes. These pigments contain fluorescent proteins which are activated by K+ (potassium) ions, and it is their movement, aggregation, and dispersion within the fluorescent chromatophore that cause directed fluorescence patterning. Fluorescent cells are innervated the same as other chromatophores, like melanophores, pigment cells that contain melanin. Short term fluorescent patterning and signaling is controlled by the nervous system. Fluorescent chromatophores can be found in the skin (e.g. in fish) just below the epidermis, amongst other chromatophores.\nEpidermal fluorescent cells in fish also respond to hormonal stimuli by the \u03b1\u2013MSH and MCH hormones much the same as melanophores. This suggests that fluorescent cells may have color changes throughout the day that coincide with their circadian rhythm. Fish may also be sensitive to cortisol induced stress responses to environmental stimuli, such as interaction with a predator or engaging in a mating ritual.\nPhylogenetics.\nEvolutionary origins.\nThe incidence of fluorescence across the tree of life is widespread, and has been studied most extensively in cnidarians and fish. The phenomenon appears to have evolved multiple times in multiple taxa such as in the anguilliformes (eels), gobioidei (gobies and cardinalfishes), and tetradontiformes (triggerfishes), along with the other taxa discussed later in the article. Fluorescence is highly genotypically and phenotypically variable even within ecosystems, in regards to the wavelengths emitted, the patterns displayed, and the intensity of the fluorescence. Generally, the species relying upon camouflage exhibit the greatest diversity in fluorescence, likely because camouflage may be one of the uses of fluorescence.\nIt is suspected by some scientists that GFPs and GFP-like proteins began as electron donors activated by light. These electrons were then used for reactions requiring light energy. Functions of fluorescent proteins, such as protection from the sun, conversion of light into different wavelengths, or for signaling are thought to have evolved secondarily.\nAdaptive functions.\nCurrently, relatively little is known about the functional significance of fluorescence and fluorescent proteins. However, it is suspected that fluorescence may serve important functions in signaling and communication, mating, lures, camouflage, UV protection and antioxidation, photoacclimation, dinoflagellate regulation, and in coral health.\nAquatic.\nWater absorbs light of long wavelengths, so less light from these wavelengths reflects back to reach the eye. Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths above violet, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the photic zone. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense as it is on the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.\nFluorescence is simply defined as the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at one wavelength and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength. Thus any type of fluorescence depends on the presence of external sources of light. Biologically functional fluorescence is found in the photic zone, where there is not only enough light to cause fluorescence, but enough light for other organisms to detect it.\nThe visual field in the photic zone is naturally blue, so colors of fluorescence can be detected as bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens. Green is the most commonly found color in the marine spectrum, yellow the second most, orange the third, and red is the rarest. Fluorescence can occur in organisms in the aphotic zone as a byproduct of that same organism's bioluminescence. Some fluorescence in the aphotic zone is merely a byproduct of the organism's tissue biochemistry and does not have a functional purpose. However, some cases of functional and adaptive significance of fluorescence in the aphotic zone of the deep ocean is an active area of research.\nPhotic zone.\nFish.\nBony fishes living in shallow water generally have good color vision due to their living in a colorful environment. Thus, in shallow-water fishes, red, orange, and green fluorescence most likely serves as a means of communication with conspecifics, especially given the great phenotypic variance of the phenomenon.\nMany fish that exhibit fluorescence, such as sharks, lizardfish, scorpionfish, wrasses, and flatfishes, also possess yellow intraocular filters. Yellow intraocular filters in the lenses and cornea of certain fishes function as long-pass filters. These filters enable the species that to visualize and potentially exploit fluorescence, in order to enhance visual contrast and patterns that are unseen to other fishes and predators that lack this visual specialization. Fish that possess the necessary yellow intraocular filters for visualizing fluorescence potentially exploit a light signal from members of it. Fluorescent patterning was especially prominent in cryptically patterned fishes possessing complex camouflage. Many of these lineages also possess yellow long-pass intraocular filters that could enable visualization of such patterns.\nAnother adaptive use of fluorescence is to generate orange and red light from the ambient blue light of the photic zone to aid vision. Red light can only be seen across short distances due to attenuation of red light wavelengths by water. Many fish species that fluoresce are small, group-living, or benthic/aphotic, and have conspicuous patterning. This patterning is caused by fluorescent tissue and is visible to other members of the species, however the patterning is invisible at other visual spectra. These intraspecific fluorescent patterns also coincide with intra-species signaling. The patterns present in ocular rings to indicate directionality of an individual's gaze, and along fins to indicate directionality of an individual's movement. Current research suspects that this red fluorescence is used for private communication between members of the same species. Due to the prominence of blue light at ocean depths, red light and light of longer wavelengths are muddled, and many predatory reef fish have little to no sensitivity for light at these wavelengths. Fish such as the fairy wrasse that have developed visual sensitivity to longer wavelengths are able to display red fluorescent signals that give a high contrast to the blue environment and are conspicuous to conspecifics in short ranges, yet are relatively invisible to other common fish that have reduced sensitivities to long wavelengths. Thus, fluorescence can be used as adaptive signaling and intra-species communication in reef fish.\nAdditionally, it is suggested that fluorescent tissues that surround an organism's eyes are used to convert blue light from the photic zone or green bioluminescence in the aphotic zone into red light to aid vision.\nSharks.\nA new fluorophore was described in two species of sharks, wherein it was due to an undescribed group of brominated tryptophane-kynurenine small molecule metabolites.\nCoral.\nFluorescence serves a wide variety of functions in coral. Fluorescent proteins in corals may contribute to photosynthesis by converting otherwise unusable wavelengths of light into ones for which the coral's symbiotic algae are able to conduct photosynthesis. Also, the proteins may fluctuate in number as more or less light becomes available as a means of photoacclimation. Similarly, these fluorescent proteins may possess antioxidant capacities to eliminate oxygen radicals produced by photosynthesis. Finally, through modulating photosynthesis, the fluorescent proteins may also serve as a means of regulating the activity of the coral's photosynthetic algal symbionts.\nCephalopods.\n\"Alloteuthis subulata\" and \"Loligo vulgaris\", two types of nearly transparent squid, have fluorescent spots above their eyes. These spots reflect incident light, which may serve as a means of camouflage, but also for signaling to other squids for schooling purposes.\nJellyfish.\nAnother, well-studied example of fluorescence in the ocean is the hydrozoan \"Aequorea victoria\". This jellyfish lives in the photic zone off the west coast of North America and was identified as a carrier of green fluorescent protein (GFP) by Osamu Shimomura. The gene for these green fluorescent proteins has been isolated and is scientifically significant because it is widely used in genetic studies to indicate the expression of other genes.\nMantis shrimp.\nSeveral species of mantis shrimp, which are stomatopod crustaceans, including \"Lysiosquillina glabriuscula\", have yellow fluorescent markings along their antennal scales and carapace (shell) that males present during threat displays to predators and other males. The display involves raising the head and thorax, spreading the striking appendages and other maxillipeds, and extending the prominent, oval antennal scales laterally, which makes the animal appear larger and accentuates its yellow fluorescent markings. Furthermore, as depth increases, mantis shrimp fluorescence accounts for a greater part of the visible light available. During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments.\nAphotic zone.\nSiphonophores.\n\"Siphonophorae\" is an order of marine animals from the phylum Hydrozoa that consist of a specialized medusoid and polyp zooid. Some siphonophores, including the genus Erenna that live in the aphotic zone between depths of 1600 m and 2300 m, exhibit yellow to red fluorescence in the photophores of their tentacle-like tentilla. This fluorescence occurs as a by-product of bioluminescence from these same photophores. The siphonophores exhibit the fluorescence in a flicking pattern that is used as a lure to attract prey.\nDragonfish.\nThe predatory deep-sea dragonfish \"Malacosteus niger\", the closely related genus \"Aristostomias\" and the species \"Pachystomias microdon\" use fluorescent red accessory pigments to convert the blue light emitted from their own bioluminescence to red light from suborbital photophores. This red luminescence is invisible to other animals, which allows these dragonfish extra light at dark ocean depths without attracting or signaling predators.\nTerrestrial.\nAmphibians.\nFluorescence is widespread among amphibians and has been documented in several families of frogs, salamanders and caecilians, but the extent of it varies greatly.\nThe polka-dot tree frog (\"Hypsiboas punctatus\"), widely found in South America, was unintentionally discovered to be the first fluorescent amphibian in 2017. The fluorescence was traced to a new compound found in the lymph and skin glands. The main fluorescent compound is Hyloin-L1 and it gives a blue-green glow when exposed to violet or ultraviolet light. The scientists behind the discovery suggested that the fluorescence can be used for communication. They speculated that fluorescence possibly is relatively widespread among frogs. Only a few months later, fluorescence was discovered in the closely related \"Hypsiboas atlanticus\". Because it is linked to secretions from skin glands, they can also leave fluorescent markings on surfaces where they have been.\nIn 2019, two other frogs, the tiny pumpkin toadlet (\"Brachycephalus ephippium\") and red pumpkin toadlet (\"B. pitanga\") of southeastern Brazil, were found to be have naturally fluorescent skeletons, which is visible through their skin when exposed to ultraviolet light. It was initially speculated that the fluorescence supplemented their already aposematic colours (they are toxic) or that it was related to mate choice (species recognition or determining fitness of a potential partner), but later studies indicate that the former explanation is unlikely, as predation attempts on the toadlets appear to be unaffected by the presence/absence of fluorescence.\nIn 2020 it was confirmed that green or yellow fluorescence is widespread not only in adult frogs that are exposed to blue or ultraviolet light, but also among tadpoles, salamanders and caecilians. The extent varies greatly depending on species; in some it is highly distinct and in others it is barely noticeable. It can be based on their skin pigmentation, their mucous or their bones.\nButterflies.\nSwallowtail (\"Papilio\") butterflies have complex systems for emitting fluorescent light. Their wings contain pigment-infused crystals that provide directed fluorescent light. These crystals function to produce fluorescent light best when they absorb radiance from sky-blue light (wavelength about 420\u00a0nm). The wavelengths of light that the butterflies see the best correspond to the absorbance of the crystals in the butterfly's wings. This likely functions to enhance the capacity for signaling.\nParrots.\nParrots have fluorescent plumage that may be used in mate signaling. A study using mate-choice experiments on budgerigars (\"Melopsittacus undulates\") found compelling support for fluorescent sexual signaling, with both males and females significantly preferring birds with the fluorescent experimental stimulus. This study suggests that the fluorescent plumage of parrots is not simply a by-product of pigmentation, but instead an adapted sexual signal. Considering the intricacies of the pathways that produce fluorescent pigments, there may be significant costs involved. Therefore, individuals exhibiting strong fluorescence may be honest indicators of high individual quality, since they can deal with the associated costs.\nArachnids.\nSpiders fluoresce under UV light and possess a huge diversity of fluorophores. Remarkably, spiders are the only known group in which fluorescence is \"taxonomically widespread, variably expressed, evolutionarily labile, and probably under selection and potentially of ecological importance for intraspecific and interspecific signaling\". A study by Andrews et al. (2007) reveals that fluorescence has evolved multiple times across spider taxa, with novel fluorophores evolving during spider diversification. In some spiders, ultraviolet cues are important for predator-prey interactions, intraspecific communication, and camouflaging with matching fluorescent flowers. Differing ecological contexts could favor inhibition or enhancement of fluorescence expression, depending upon whether fluorescence helps spiders be cryptic or makes them more conspicuous to predators. Therefore, natural selection could be acting on expression of fluorescence across spider species.\nScorpions also fluorescent due to the presence of beta carboline in their cuticles.\nPlatypus.\nIn 2020 fluorescence was reported for several specimen of platypus.\nPlants.\nMany plants are fluorescent due to the presence of chlorophyll, which is probably the most widely-distributed fluorescent molecule, producing red emission under a range of excitation wavelengths. This attribute of chlorophyll is commonly used by ecologists to measure photosynthetic efficiency.\nThe \"Mirabilis jalapa\" flower contains violet, fluorescent betacyanins and yellow, fluorescent betaxanthins. Under white light, parts of the flower containing only betaxanthins appear yellow, but in areas where both betaxanthins and betacyanins are present, the visible fluorescence of the flower is faded due to internal light-filtering mechanisms. Fluorescence was previously suggested to play a role in pollinator attraction, however, it was later found that the visual signal by fluorescence is negligible compared to the visual signal of light reflected by the flower.\nAbiotic.\nGemology, mineralogy and geology.\nGemstones, minerals, may have a distinctive fluorescence or may fluoresce differently under short-wave ultraviolet, long-wave ultraviolet, visible light, or X-rays.\nMany types of calcite and amber will fluoresce under shortwave UV, longwave UV and visible light. Rubies, emeralds, and diamonds exhibit red fluorescence under long-wave UV, blue and sometimes green light; diamonds also emit light under X-ray radiation.\nFluorescence in minerals is caused by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, in the form of the uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.\nCrude oil (petroleum) fluoresces in a range of colors, from dull-brown for heavy oils and tars through to bright-yellowish and bluish-white for very light oils and condensates. This phenomenon is used in oil exploration drilling to identify very small amounts of oil in drill cuttings and core samples.\nOrganic liquids.\nOrganic solutions such anthracene or stilbene, dissolved in benzene or toluene, fluoresce with ultraviolet or gamma ray irradiation. The decay times of this fluorescence are on the order of nanoseconds, since the duration of the light depends on the lifetime of the excited states of the fluorescent material, in this case anthracene or stilbene.\nScintillation is defined a flash of light produced in a transparent material by the passage of a particle (an electron, an alpha particle, an ion, or a high-energy photon). Stilbene and derivatives are used in scintillation counters to detect such particles. Stilbene is also one of the gain mediums used in dye lasers.\nAtmosphere.\nFluorescence is observed in the atmosphere when the air is under energetic electron bombardment. In cases such as the natural aurora, high-altitude nuclear explosions, and rocket-borne electron gun experiments, the molecules and ions formed have a fluorescent response to light.\nIn novel technology.\nIn August 2020 researchers reported the creation of the brightest fluorescent solid optical materials so far by enabling the transfer of properties of highly fluorescent dyes via spatial and electronic isolation of the dyes by mixing cationic dyes with anion-binding cyanostar macrocycles. According to a co-author these materials may have applications in areas such as solar energy harvesting, bioimaging, and lasers.\nApplications.\nLighting.\nThe common fluorescent lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum and a small amount of mercury. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the \"phosphor\", which absorbs ultraviolet light and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional fluorescent lamps may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254\u00a0nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436\u00a0nm (blue), 546\u00a0nm (green) and 579\u00a0nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many compact fluorescent lamp and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.\nFluorescent lights were first available to the public at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life, and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes (such as compact fluorescent lamps). Some high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps couple their even-greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.\nWhite light-emitting diodes (LEDs) became available in the mid-1990s as LED lamps, in which blue light emitted from the semiconductor strikes phosphors deposited on the tiny chip. The combination of the blue light that continues through the phosphor and the green to red fluorescence from the phosphors produces a net emission of white light.\nGlow sticks sometimes utilize fluorescent materials to absorb light from the chemiluminescent reaction and emit light of a different color.\nAnalytical chemistry.\nMany analytical procedures involve the use of a fluorometer, usually with a single exciting wavelength and single detection wavelength. Because of the sensitivity that the method affords, fluorescent molecule concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion can be measured.\nFluorescence in several wavelengths can be detected by an array detector, to detect compounds from HPLC flow. Also, TLC plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent. Fluorescence is most effective when there is a larger ratio of atoms at lower energy levels in a Boltzmann distribution. There is, then, a higher probability of excitement and release of photons by lower-energy atoms, making analysis more efficient.\nSpectroscopy.\nUsually the setup of a fluorescence assay involves a light source, which may emit many different wavelengths of light. In general, a single wavelength is required for proper analysis, so, in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell. After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may emerge due to Stokes shift and various electron transitions. To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an emission monochromator, and observed selectively by a detector.\nBiochemistry and medicine.\nFluorescence in the life sciences is used generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysis of biological molecules by means of the fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent (called intrinsic or autofluorescence).\nIn fact, a protein or other component can be \"labelled\" with an extrinsic fluorophore, a fluorescent dye that can be a small molecule, protein, or quantum dot, finding a large use in many biological applications.\nThe quantification of a dye is done with a spectrofluorometer and finds additional applications in:\nForensics.\nFingerprints can be visualized with fluorescent compounds such as ninhydrin or DFO (1,8-Diazafluoren-9-one). Blood and other substances are sometimes detected by fluorescent reagents, like fluorescein. Fibers, and other materials that may be encountered in forensics or with a relationship to various collectibles, are sometimes fluorescent.\nNon-destructive testing.\nFluorescent penetrant inspection is used to find cracks and other defects on the surface of a part. Dye tracing, using fluorescent dyes, is used to find leaks in liquid and gas plumbing systems.\nSignage.\nFluorescent colors are frequently used in signage, particularly road signs. Fluorescent colors are generally recognizable at longer ranges than their non-fluorescent counterparts, with fluorescent orange being particularly noticeable. This property has led to its frequent use in safety signs and labels.\nOptical brighteners.\nFluorescent compounds are often used to enhance the appearance of fabric and paper, causing a \"whitening\" effect. A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white. Optical brighteners are used in laundry detergents, high brightness paper, cosmetics, high-visibility clothing and more."}

For example,\nThe theorem says two things for this example: first, that 1200 be represented as a product of primes, and second, that no matter how this is done, there will always be exactly four 2s, one 3, two 5s, and no other primes in the product.\nThe requirement that the factors be prime is necessary: factorizations containing composite numbers may not be unique \n(for example, formula_2).\nThis theorem is one of the main reasons why 1 is not considered a prime number: if 1 were prime, then factorization into primes would not be unique; for example, formula_3\nEuclid's original version.\nBook VII, propositions 30, 31 and 32, and Book IX, proposition 14 of Euclid's \"Elements\" are essentially the statement and proof of the fundamental theorem.\n(In modern terminology: if a prime \"p\" divides the product \"ab\", then \"p\" divides either \"a\" or \"b\" or both.) Proposition 30 is referred to as Euclid's lemma, and it is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.\n(In modern terminology: every integer greater than one is divided evenly by some prime number.) Proposition 31 is proved directly by infinite descent.\nProposition 32 is derived from proposition 31, and proves that the decomposition is possible.\n(In modern terminology: a least common multiple of several prime numbers is not a multiple of any other prime number.) Book IX, proposition 14 is derived from Book VII, proposition 30, and proves partially that the decomposition is unique \u2013 a point critically noted by Andr\u00e9 Weil. Indeed, in this proposition the exponents are all equal to one, so nothing is said for the general case.\nArticle 16 of Gauss' \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" is an early modern statement and proof employing modular arithmetic.\nApplications.\nCanonical representation of a positive integer.\nEvery positive integer \"n\" &gt; 1 can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers:\nwhere \"p\"1 &lt; \"p\"2 &lt; ... &lt; \"p\"k are primes and the \"n\"\"i\" are positive integers. This representation is commonly extended to all positive integers, including 1, by the convention that the empty product is equal to 1 (the empty product corresponds to \"k\" = 0).\nThis representation is called the canonical representation of \"n\", or the standard form of \"n\". For example,\nFactors \"p\"0 = 1 may be inserted without changing the value of \"n\" (for example, 1000 = 23\u00d730\u00d753). In fact, any positive integer can be uniquely represented as an infinite product taken over all the positive prime numbers:\nwhere a finite number of the \"n\"\"i\" are positive integers, and the rest are zero. Allowing negative exponents provides a canonical form for positive rational numbers.\nArithmetic operations.\nThe canonical representations of the product, greatest common divisor (GCD), and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \"a\" and \"b\" can be expressed simply in terms of the canonical representations of \"a\" and \"b\" themselves:\nHowever, integer factorization, especially of large numbers, is much more difficult than computing products, GCDs, or LCMs. So these formulas have limited use in practice.\nArithmetic functions.\nMany arithmetic functions are defined using the canonical representation. In particular, the values of additive and multiplicative functions are determined by their values on the powers of prime numbers.\nProof.\nThe proof uses Euclid's lemma (\"Elements\" VII, 30): If a prime divides the product of two integers and , then must divide at least one of those integers and .\nExistence.\nIt must be shown that every integer greater than 1 is either prime or a product of primes. First, 2 is prime. Then, by strong induction, assume this is true for all numbers greater than 1 and less than \"n\". If \"n\" is prime, there is nothing more to prove. Otherwise, there are integers \"a\" and \"b\", where \"n\" = \"ab\", and . By the induction hypothesis, and are products of primes. But then is a product of primes.\nUniqueness.\nSuppose, to the contrary, there is an integer that has two distinct prime factorizations. Let \"n\" be the least such integer and write \"n\" = \"p\"1 \"p\"2 ... \"p\"\"j\" = \"q\"1 \"q\"2 ... \"q\"\"k\", where each \"p\"\"i\" and \"q\"\"i\" is prime. (Note \"j\" and \"k\" are both at least 2.) We see \"p\"1 divides \"q\"1 \"q\"2 ... \"q\"\"k\", so \"p\"1 divides some \"q\"\"i\" by Euclid's lemma. Without loss of generality, say \"p\"1 divides \"q\"1. Since \"p\"1 and \"q\"1 are both prime, it follows that \"p\"1 = \"q\"1. Returning to our factorizations of \"n\", we may cancel these two terms to conclude \"p\"2 ... \"p\"\"j\" = \"q\"2 ... \"q\"\"k\". We now have two distinct prime factorizations of some integer strictly smaller than \"n\", which contradicts the minimality of \"n\".\nUniqueness without Euclid's lemma.\nThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic can also be proved without using Euclid's lemma. The proof that follows is inspired by Euclid's original version of the Euclidean algorithm. \nAssume that formula_7 is the smallest positive integer which is the product of prime numbers in two different ways. Incidentally, this implies that formula_7, if it exists, must be a composite number greater than formula_9. Now, say \nEvery formula_11 must be distinct from every formula_12 Otherwise, if say formula_13 then there would exist some positive integer formula_14 that is smaller than and has two distinct prime factorizations. One may also suppose that formula_15 by exchanging the two factorizations, if needed.\nSetting formula_16 and formula_17 one has formula_18 It follows that\nAs the positive integers less than have been supposed to have a unique prime factorization, formula_20 must occur in the factorization of either formula_21 or . The latter case is impossible, as , being smaller than , must have a unique prime factorization, and formula_20 differs from every formula_12 The former case is also impossible, as, if formula_20 is a divisor of formula_25 it must be also a divisor of formula_26 which is impossible as formula_20 and formula_28 are distinct primes.\nTherefore, there cannot exist a smallest integer with more than a single distinct prime factorization. Every positive integer must either be a prime number itself, which would factor uniquely, or a composite that also factors uniquely into primes, or in the case of the integer formula_9, not factor into any prime.\nGeneralizations.\nThe first generalization of the theorem is found in Gauss's second monograph (1832) on biquadratic reciprocity. This paper introduced what is now called the ring of Gaussian integers, the set of all complex numbers \"a\" + \"bi\" where \"a\" and \"b\" are integers. It is now denoted by formula_30 He showed that this ring has the four units \u00b11 and \u00b1\"i\", that the non-zero, non-unit numbers fall into two classes, primes and composites, and that (except for order), the composites have unique factorization as a product of primes.\nSimilarly, in 1844 while working on cubic reciprocity, Eisenstein introduced the ring formula_31, where formula_32 \u00a0 formula_33 is a cube root of unity. This is the ring of Eisenstein integers, and he proved it has the six units formula_34 and that it has unique factorization.\nHowever, it was also discovered that unique factorization does not always hold. An example is given by formula_35. In this ring one has\nExamples like this caused the notion of \"prime\" to be modified. In formula_35 it can be proven that if any of the factors above can be represented as a product, for example, 2 = \"ab\", then one of \"a\" or \"b\" must be a unit. This is the traditional definition of \"prime\". It can also be proven that none of these factors obeys Euclid's lemma; for example, 2 divides neither (1 + ) nor (1 \u2212 ) even though it divides their product 6. In algebraic number theory 2 is called irreducible in formula_35 (only divisible by itself or a unit) but not prime in formula_35 (if it divides a product it must divide one of the factors). The mention of formula_35 is required because 2 is prime and irreducible in formula_41 Using these definitions it can be proven that in any integral domain a prime must be irreducible. Euclid's classical lemma can be rephrased as \"in the ring of integers formula_42 every irreducible is prime\". This is also true in formula_43 and formula_44 but not in formula_45\nThe rings in which factorization into irreducibles is essentially unique are called unique factorization domains. Important examples are polynomial rings over the integers or over a field, Euclidean domains and principal ideal domains.\nIn 1843 Kummer introduced the concept of ideal number, which was developed further by Dedekind (1876) into the modern theory of ideals, special subsets of rings. Multiplication is defined for ideals, and the rings in which they have unique factorization are called Dedekind domains.\nThere is a version of unique factorization for ordinals, though it requires some additional conditions to ensure uniqueness.\nReferences.\nThe \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" has been translated from Latin into English and German.

{"id": "11558", "revid": "9929111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11558", "title": "Flamenco", "text": "Flamenco (), in its strictest sense, is an art form based on the various folkloric music traditions of southern Spain in the autonomous community of Andalusia, specially in areas of Sevilla, C\u00e1diz, Huelva and Jerez de la Frontera, as well as in some areas of the Region of Murcia and Extremadura. In a wider sense, not always in a correct way, the term is used to refer to the variety of similar Spanish musical styles from the South of Spain. \nFlamenco dates from the 18th century. The oldest record of flamenco music dates to 1774 in the book \"Las Cartas Marruecas\" by Jos\u00e9 Cadalso. Although the RAE dictionary associates it with Andalusian popular culture and the notable presence of Gitanos in Spain during its origin, the exact origin of flamenco is unknown and the subject of many hypotheses. Current studies about the genre tells us that it is in fact a cross-cultural interchange of different cultures that coincided in Andalusia. \nThe musical genre influences can be seen in its dances, singing, music, clothing, instruments, rules, etc. from Romani (they came from India)/Gitanos, Gregorian chants from the Catholic Church, Oriundos, Jewish, Al-\u00c1ndalus, Castellanos... that converged in Spain and created the modern flamenco. \nAlthough its germ already existed in the Andalusian region long before the Gitanos arrived, also taking into account that there were Gitanos in other regions of Spain and Europe; flamenco was only cultivated by those who were in Andalusia.4 In Spain Flamenco has been influenced by and associated always with Gitanos and Romani people from Spain; however, its origin and style are uniquely Andalusian and Flamenco artists have historically included Spanish in both Gitano/Romani heritage or not.\nManuel R\u00edos Ruiz notes that the development of flamenco is well documented: \"the theatre movement of sainetes (one-act plays) and tonadillas, popular song books and song sheets, customs, studies of dances, and \"toques\", perfection, newspapers, graphic documents in paintings and engravings...in continuous evolution together with rhythm, the poetic stanzas, and the ambiance\" \nFlamenco has become popular all over the world, especially the United States and Japan. In Japan, there are more flamenco academies than there are in Spain \nOn November 16, 2010, UNESCO declared flamenco one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity , and it is also Andalusian Ethnological Intangible Cultural Heritage and is registered in the General Inventory of Movable Assets of the Region of Murcia established by the General Directorate of Fine Arts and Cultural Assets.\nIts popularity in Latin America has been such that in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and Puerto Rico various groups and academies have emerged. Its wide dissemination and study in Chile has even allowed the appearance of well-known national figures, such as the guitarists Carlos Ledermann and Carlos Pacheco Torres, who teaches a chair of Flamenco Guitar at the Conservatorio Superior de M\u00fasica Rafael Orozco de C\u00f3rdoba. In Japan it is so popular that it is said that in that there are more flamenco academies in the country than in Spain.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"flamenco\", referring to the artistic genre that is known under that name, it dates back to the mid-nineteenth century. There is no certainty of its etymology, so several hypotheses have been raised:\nThere is no certainty as to why the Gitanos were called \"flamencos\", however, there are numerous reports that point to a slang origin, placing the term \"flamenco\" within the lexicon of the german\u00eda. This theory holds that \"flamenco\" derives from \" flamancia \", a word that comes from \"flama\" and which in German refers to the fiery temperament of the gypsies. In the same sense, the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy says that \"flamenco\" colloquially means \"cool or insolent\", an example of which is the phrase \"to become flamenco\". In a similar meaning, the term \"flamenco\" is used as a synonym of \"knife\" and of \"gresca\" or \"algazara\" by Juan Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez del Castillo, in his sainete \"The boastful soldier\" (ca. 1785). However, Seraf\u00edn Est\u00e9banez Calder\u00f3n who in his \"Andalusian scenes\" (1847) provides the first descriptions of flamenco situations, did not use that name to describe them. \nCante jondo.\nAccording to the RAE dictionary, \"cante jondo\" is \"the most genuine Andalusian cante, with deep feeling.\" This dictionary includes the phrases \"cante jondo\" or \"cante hondo\" as equivalents, which guarantees that the term \"jondo\" is nothing more than the [[Andalusian dialect | Andalusian dialect form] ] of the word \"hondo\", with its characteristic [[Andalusian dialect # Aspiration of / h / from initial Latin / f / | aspiration of h from initial f]]. However, [[M\u00e1ximo Jos\u00e9 Kahn]] came to maintain that the term \"jondo\" comes from the locution [[Hebrew | Hebrew language]] \"jom-tob\" or \"yom-tob\", an ending of some [[Jewish music | Synagogue songs]]. According to Garc\u00eda Matos and Hip\u00f3lito Rossy, not all flamenco cante is cante jondo. [[Manuel de Falla]] considered that cante jondo was ancient cante, while flamenco cante was modern. \nFlamenco and Andalusian folklore.\n[[File: FeriaJerez2010-P1070104.JPG | thumb | Dance by [[sevillanas]].]]\nThe flamenco style took shape during the 19th century, on the substrate of Andalusian traditional music and dance, whose origins are ancient and diverse. However, flamenco wasn't the folklore of Andalusia (made up of [[Seguidilla|Seguidillas]], [[Sevillanas]], [[Fandango|Fandangos]], [[Verdiales]], Trovos, Chacarr\u00e1, El vito ...) and not even from all Spain at first. Flamenco gone from being a music performed by minorities in the south of Spain, with greater or lesser diffusion to become so important that generated the identity emblem of Spain, inside and outside the country. This fact could be related to [[Francoist Spain|Franco]]'s dictatorial regime in Spain because at that moment the dictator imposed flamenco and the culture of mostly southern Spain as the only culture of Spain, trying to suppress the other regional cultures and create a united Spain around only few cultural elements. France also used it to promote tourism and create a more consolidated image of the country of Spain and it's \"only\" distinctive and unique culture (although there were more cultures in Spain).\nFlamenco is considered a tourist attraction of the first order for Andalusia, both as a show and as an art for study, even as doctorate, university expert or subject of university diploma. Awards are also given for flamenco research.\nHistory.\nIt is believed that the flamenco genre emerged at the end of the 18th century in cities and agrarian towns of Baja Andalusia, highlighting [[Jerez de la Frontera]] as the first written vestige of this art, although there is practically no data related to those dates and the manifestations of this time they are more typical of the bolero school than of flamenco. There are hypotheses that point to the influence on flamenco of types of dance from the Indian subcontinent - the place of origin of the Romani people - such as the [[kathak]] dance. But also, the documentary Gurumb\u00e9, songs from your black memory, shows the African influence on the rhythms and choreographies of flamenco. The musician and anthropologist Ra\u00fal Rodr\u00edguez points out that in the Bantu language fanda means party, and the suffix -ngo (as in \"Congo\" or \"Mandinga\") indicates a possible African origin of the word \"fandango\". \nThe casticismo.\nIn 1783 Carlos [[Charles III of Spain|III]] promulgated a pragmatics that regulated the social situation of the Gitanos. This was a momentous event in the history of Spanish Romani who, after centuries of marginalization and persecution, saw their legal situation improve substantially.\nAfter the [[Peninsular War|Spanish War of Independence]] (1808-1812), a feeling of racial pride developed in the Spanish conscience, which contrasts with the French enlightenment the telluric force of the majo, archetype of individualism, grace and chasticism. In this environment, ca\u00f1\u00ed fashion triumphs, because traditionalism sees in the Gitanos an ideal model of that individualism. The emergence of the [[bullfighting]] schools of [[Ronda]] and [[Seville]], the rise of the Bandidos and Vaqueros and the fascination for Andalusia manifested by European romantic travelers, gradually shaped Andalusian manners, which triumphed in the Madrid court.\nAt this time there is evidence of disagreements due to the introduction of innovations in art.\nLos caf\u00e9s cantantes.\nIn 1881 [[Silverio Franconetti]] opened the first flamenco singer caf\u00e9 in Seville. In Silverio's caf\u00e9 the cantaores were in a very competitive environment, which allowed the emergence of the professional cantaor and served as a crucible where flamenco art was configured. In them Gitanos and non-Gitanos learned the cantes, while reinterpreted the Andalusian folk songs in their own style, expanding the repertoire. Likewise, the taste of the public contributed to configure the flamenco genre, unifying its technique and its theme.\nThe antiflamenquismo of \"[[Generaci\u00f3n del 98|La generaci\u00f3n del 98]]\".\nFlamenco, defined by the Royal Spanish Academy as a \"fondness for flamenco art and customs\", is a conceptual catch-all where flamenco singing and a fondness for bullfighting, among other traditional Spanish elements, fit. These customs were strongly attacked by the generation of 98, all of its members being \"anti-flamenco\", with the exception of the Machado brothers, since Manuel and Antonio, being Sevillians and sons of the folklorist Dem\u00f3filo, had a more complex vision of the matter. The greatest standard bearer of anti-flamenquism was the [[Madrid]] writer Eugenio Noel, who, in his youth, had been a militant casticista. Noel attributed to flamenco and bullfighting the origin of the ills of Spain. In his view, the absence of these cultural manifestations in modern European states seemed to translate into greater economic and social development. These considerations caused an insurmountable rift to be established for decades between flamenco and most \"intellectuals\" of the time.\nThe Flamenca opera.\nBetween 1920 and 1955, flamenco shows began to be held in bullrings and theaters, under the name \"Flamenco Opera\". This denomination was an economic strategy of the promoters, since opera only paid 3% while variety shows paid 10%. At this time, flamenco shows spread throughout Spain and the main cities of the world. The great social and commercial success achieved by flamenco at this time eliminated some of the oldest and most sober styles from the stage, in favor of lighter airs, such as [[canti\u00f1as]], los [[cantes de ida y vuelta]] and [[Fandango|fandangos]], of which many personal versions were created. The purist critics attacked this lightness of the cantes, as well as the use of falsete and the [[Gaiteros del Zulia|gaitero]] style.\nIn the line of purism, the poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] and the composer [[Manuel de Falla]] had the idea of concurso de cante jondo en [[Granada]] en [[1922]]. Both artists conceived of flamenco as folklore, not as a scenic artistic genre; for this reason, they were concerned, since they believed that the massive triumph of flamenco would end its purest and deepest roots. To remedy this, they organized a cante jondo contest in which only amateurs could participate and in which festive cantes (such as canti\u00f1as) were excluded, which Falla and Lorca did not consider jondos, but flamencos. The jury was chaired by Antonio Chac\u00f3n, who at that time was the leading figure in cante. The winners were \"El Tenazas\", a retired professional cantaor from Mor\u00f3n de la Frontera, and Manuel Ortega, an eight-year-old boy from Seville who would go down in flamenco history as Manolo Caracol. The contest turned out to be a failure due to the scant echo it had and because Lorca and Falla did not know how to understand the professional character that flamenco already had at that time, striving in vain to seek a purity that never existed in an art that was characterized by mixture and the personal innovation of its creators. Apart from this failure, with the [[generation of '27]], whose most eminent members were Andalusians and therefore knew the genre first-hand, the recognition of flamenco by intellectuals began.\nAt that time, there were already flamenco recordings related to Christmas, which can be divided into two groups: the traditional flamenco carol and flamenco songs that adapt their lyrics to the Christmas theme. These cantes have been maintained to this day, the Zambomba Jerezana being spatially representative, declared an Asset of Intangible Cultural Interest by the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda in December 2015.\nDuring the [[Spanish Civil War]], a large number of singers were exiled or died defending the [[Republic of spain|Republic]] and the humiliations to which they were being subjected by the National Party: [[Bando Nacional]]: [[Corruco de Algeciras]], [[Chaconcito]], [[El Carbonerillo]], [[El Chato De Las Ventas]], [[Manuel Vallejo|Vallejito]], [[Rita la Cantaora]], [[Angelillo]], [[Guerrita (cantaor)|Guerrita]] are some of them. In the postwar period and the first years of the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]], the world of flamenco was viewed with suspicion, as the authorities were not clear that this genre contributed to the national conscience. However, the regime soon ended up adopting flamenco as one of the quintessential Spanish cultural manifestations. The singers who have survived the war go from stars to almost outcasts, singing for the young men in the private rooms of the brothels in the center of Seville where they have to adapt to the whims of aristocrats, soldiers and businessmen who have become rich.\nIn short, the period of the Flamenco Opera was a time open to creativity and that definitely made up most of the flamenco repertoire. It was the Golden Age of this genre, with figures such as [[Antonio Chac\u00f3n]], Manuel Vallejo, [[Manuel Torre]], [[La Ni\u00f1a de los Peines]], [[Pepe Marchena]] and [[Manolo Caracol]].\nFlamencolog\u00eda.\nStarting in the 1950s, abundant anthropological and musicological studies on flamenco began to be published. In 1954 Hispavox published the first Antolog\u00eda del Cante Flamenco, a sound recording that was a great shock to its time, dominated by orchestrated cante and, consequently, mystified. In 1955, the Argentine intellectual Anselmo Gonz\u00e1lez Climent published an essay called Flamencolog\u00eda, whose title he baptized the \"set of knowledge, techniques, etc., on flamenco singing and dancing.\" This book dignified the study of flamenco by applying the academic methodology of musicology to it and served as the basis for subsequent studies on this genre.\nAs a result, in 1956 the National Contest of Cante Jondo de C\u00f3rdoba was organized and in 1958 the first Flamencology Chair was founded in Jerez de la Frontera, the oldest academic institution dedicated to the study, research, conservation, promotion and defense of the flamenco art. Likewise, in 1963 the Cordovan poet Ricardo Molina and the Sevillian cantaor [[Antonio Mairena]] published Alalim\u00f3n Mundo y Formas del [[Cante flamenco|Cante Flamenco]], which has become a must-have reference work.\nFor a long time the Mairenistas postulates were considered practically unquestionable, until they found an answer in other authors who elaborated the \"Andalusian thesis\", which defended that flamenco was a genuinely Andalusian product, since it had been developed entirely in this region and because its styles basic ones derived from the folklore of Andalusia. They also maintained that the Andalusian Gitanos had contributed decisively to their formation, highlighting the exceptional nature of flamenco among gypsy music and dances from other parts of Spain and Europe. The unification of the Gitanos and Andalusian thesis has ended up being the most accepted today. In short, between the 1950s and 1970s, flamenco went from being a mere show to also becoming an object of study.\nFlamenco protest during the Franco regime.\nFlamenco became one of the symbols of Spanish national identity during the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]], since the regime knew how to appropriate a folklore traditionally associated with Andalusia to promote national unity and attract tourism, constituting what was called national-flamenquismo. Hence, flamenco had long been seen as a reactionary or retrograde element. In the mid-60s and until the transition, cantaores who opposed the regime began to appear with the use of protest lyrics. These include: Jos\u00e9 Menese and lyricist Francisco Moreno Galv\u00e1n, [[Enrique Morente]], Manuel Gerena, [[El Lebrijano]], [[El Cabrero]], [[Lole y Manuel]], el Piki or Luis Mar\u00edn, among many others. \nIn contrast to this conservatism with which it was associated during the Franco regime, flamenco suffered the influence of the wave of activism that also shook the university against the repression of the regime when university students came into contact with this art in the recitals that were held, for example, at the Colegio Mayor de San Juan Evangelista: \"flamenco amateurs and professionals got involved with performances of a manifestly political nature. It was a kind of flamenco protest charged with protest, which meant censorship and repression for the flamenco activists \". \nAs the political transition progressed, the demands were deflated as flamenco inserted itself within the flows of globalized art. At the same time, this art was institutionalized until it reached the point that the [[Regional Government of Andalusia|Junta de Andaluc\u00eda]] was attributed in 2007 \"exclusive competence in matters of knowledge, conservation, research, training, promotion and dissemination\".\nFlamenco Fusion.\nIn the 1970s, there were airs of social and political change in Spain, and Spanish society was already quite influenced by various musical styles from the rest of Europe and the United States. There were also numerous singers who had grown up listening to [[Antonio Mairena]], [[Pepe Marchena]] and [[Manolo Caracol]]. The combination of both factors led to a revolutionary period called Flamenco Fusion. | Seville Flamenco Dance Museum 2014.\nThe singer [[Roc\u00edo Jurado]] internationalized flamenco at the beginning of the 70s, replacing the bata de cola with evening dresses. His facet in the \"Fandangos de Huelva\" and in the Alegr\u00edas was recognized internationally for his perfect voice tessitura in these genres. She used to be accompanied in her concerts by guitarists Enrique de Melchor and [[Tomatito]], not only at the national level but in countries like Colombia, Venezuela and Puerto Rico.\nThe musical representative Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pulp\u00f3n was a decisive character in that fusion, as he urged the cantaor Agujetas to collaborate with the Sevillian Andalusian rock group \"[[Pata Negra]]\", the most revolutionary couple since Antonio Chac\u00f3n and [[Ram\u00f3n Montoya]], initiating a new path for flamenco. It also fostered the artistic union between the virtuous guitarist from Algeciras [[Paco de Luc\u00eda]] and the long-standing singer from the island [[Camar\u00f3n de la Isla]], who gave a creative impulse to flamenco that would mean its definitive break with Mairena's conservatism. When both artists undertook their solo careers, Camar\u00f3n became a mythical cantaor for his art and personality, with a legion of followers, while Paco de Luc\u00eda reconfigured the entire musical world of flamenco, opening up to new influences, such as Brazilian music, Arabic and jazz and introducing new musical instruments such as the Peruvian cajon, the transverse flute, etc.\nOther leading performers in this process of formal flamenco renewal were [[El Lebrijano|Juan Pe\u00f1a El Lebrijano]], who married flamenco with Andalusian music, and [[Enrique Morente]], who throughout his long artistic career has oscillated between the purism of his first recordings and the crossbreeding with rock, or [[Remedios Amaya]] from [[Triana, Seville|Triana]], cultivator of a unique style of [[Tango (flamenco)|tangos]] from Extremadura, and a wedge of purity in her cante make her part of this select group of established artists. Other singers with their own style include [[Cancanilla de Marbella]]. In 2011 this style became known in India thanks to [[Mar\u00eda del Mar Fern\u00e1ndez]], who acts in the video clip of the film You Live Once, entitled Se\u00f1orita. The film was seen by more than 73 million viewers.\nNew Flamenco.\nIn the 1980s a new generation of flamenco artists emerged who had been influenced by the mythical cantaor Camar\u00f3n, Paco de Luc\u00eda, Morente, etc. These artists were interested in popular urban music, which in those years was renewing the Spanish music scene, it was the time of the [[Movida madrile\u00f1a]]. Among them are \"[[Pata Negra]]\", who fused flamenco with blues and rock, [[Ketama]], of pop and Cuban inspiration and Ray Heredia, creator of his own musical universe where flamenco occupies a central place.\nAlso the recording company Nuevos Medios released many musicians under the label Nuevo Flamenco and this denomination has grouped musicians very different from each other like [[Rosario Flores]], daughter of [[Lola Flores]], or the renowned singer [[Mal\u00fa]], niece of Paco de Luc\u00eda and daughter of Pepe de Luc\u00eda, who despite sympathizing with flamenco and keeping it in her discography has continued with her personal style. However, the fact that many of the interpreters of this new music are also renowned cantaores, in the case of [[Jos\u00e9 Merc\u00e9]], [[Diego el Cigala|El Cigala]], and others, has led to labeling everything they perform as flamenco, although the genre of their songs differs quite a bit from the classic flamenco. This has generated very different feelings, both for and against.\nOther contemporary artists of that moment were O'Funkillo and [[Ojos de Brujo]], Arc\u00e1ngel, [[Miguel Poveda]], [[Mayte Mart\u00edn]], Marina Heredia, [[Estrella Morente]] or Manuel Lombo , etc.\nBut the discussion between the difference of [[Flamenco]] and [[New Flamenco]] in Spain has just gained strength during since 2019 due to the success of New Flamenco attracting the taste of the youngest Spanish fans but also in the international musical scene emphasizing the problem of how should we call this new musical genre mixed with flamenco. \nOne of these artist who has reinvented flamenco is [[Rosal\u00eda (singer)|Rosal\u00eda]], an indisputable name on the international music scene. \"Pienso en tu mir\u00e1\", \"Di mi nombre\" or the song that catapulted her to fame, \"Malamente\", are a combination of styles that includes a flamenco/south Spain traditional musical base. Rosal\u00eda has broken the limits of this musical genre by embracing other urban rhythms, but has also created a lot of controversy about which genre is she using. The [[Catalonia|Catalan]] artist has been awarded several [[Latin Grammy Award|Latin Grammy]]Awards and [[MTV Video Music Awards]], which also, at just 26 years old, garners more than 12 million monthly listeners on [[Spotify]].\nBut it's not the only successful case, the Granada-born [[Dellafuente]], [[C. Tangana]], [[MAKA]], [[RVFV]], Demarco Flamenco, [[Maria Arnal|Maria \u00c0rnal]] and Marcel Bag\u00e9s, El Ni\u00f1o de Elche, [[S\u00edlvia P\u00e9rez Cruz]]; Califato 3/4, Juanito Makand\u00e9, Soledad Morente, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Llergo o [[Fuel Fandango]] are only a few of the new spanish musical scene that includes flamenco in their music.\nIt seems that the Spanish music scene is experiencing a change in its music and new rhythms are re-emerging together with new artists who are experimenting to cover a wider audience that wants to maintain the closeness that flamenco has transmitted for decades.\n\"Palos\".\n[[File:Palos flamencos.jpg|thumb|The \"Palos\" of Flamenco]]\n\"[[Palo (flamenco)|Palos]]\" (formerly known as \"cantes\") are flamenco styles, classified by criteria such as rhythmic pattern, [[Musical mode|mode]], [[chord progression]], [[stanza]]ic form and geographic origin. There are over 50 different \"palos\", some are sung unaccompanied while others have guitar or other accompaniment. Some forms are danced while others are not. Some are reserved for men and others for women while some may be performed by either, though these traditional distinctions are breaking down: the \"Farruca\", for example, once a male dance, is now commonly performed by women too.\nThere are many ways to categorize \"Palos\" but they traditionally fall into three classes: the most serious is known as \"[[cante jondo]]\" (or \"[[Cante flamenco#Cante Grande (also known as cante jondo)|cante grande]]\"), while lighter, frivolous forms are called \"[[Cante Chico|cante chico]]\". Forms that do not fit either category are classed as \"[[Cante Intermedio|cante intermedio]]\" . These are the best known \"palos\" (; ):\nMusic.\nStructure.\nA typical flamenco recital with voice and guitar accompaniment comprises a series of pieces (not exactly \"songs\") in different palos. Each song is a set of verses (called \"copla\", \"tercio\", or \"letras\"), punctuated by guitar interludes (\"[[falseta]]s\"). The guitarist also provides a short introduction setting the tonality, \"comp\u00e1s\" (see below) and tempo of the cante . In some palos, these falsetas are played with a specific structure too; for example, the typical [[sevillanas]] is played in an AAB pattern, where A and B are the same falseta with only a slight difference in the ending .\nHarmony.\nFlamenco uses the [[Flamenco mode]] (which can also be described as the [[Phrygian mode#Modern Phrygian mode|modern Phrygian mode]] (\"modo frigio\"), or a harmonic version of that scale with a major 3rd [[degree (music)|degree]]), in addition to the [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] scales commonly used in modern Western music. The Phrygian mode occurs in \"palos\" such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], most [[buler\u00edas]], [[siguiriya]]s, [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]] and [[tientos]].\n[[File:E Phrygian Scale.PNG|frame|left|Descending E Phrygian scale in flamenco music, with common alterations in parentheses]]\nA typical [[chord sequence]], usually called the \"[[Andalusian cadence]]\" may be viewed as in a modified Phrygian: in E the sequence is Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013E . According to [[Manolo Sanl\u00facar]] E is here the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], F has the [[diatonic function|harmonic function]] of [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] while Am and G assume the functions of [[subdominant]] and [[mediant]] respectively .\nGuitarists tend to use only two basic inversions or \"chord shapes\" for the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] [[chord (music)]], the open 1st inversion E and the open 3rd inversion A, though they often [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] these by using a [[capo]]. Modern guitarists such as [[Ram\u00f3n Montoya]], have introduced other positions: Montoya himself started to use other chords for the tonic in the [[Dorian mode|modern Dorian]] sections of several \"palos\"; F for \"[[Tarantella|tarantas]]\", B for \"[[grana\u00edna]]s\" and A for the \"minera\". Montoya also created a new \"palo\" as a solo for guitar, the \"[[ronde\u00f1a]]\" in C with \"[[scordatura]]\". Later guitarists have further extended the repertoire of [[tonality|tonalities]], chord positions and \"scordatura\".\nThere are also \"palos\" in major mode; most [[canti\u00f1as]] and [[alegr\u00edas]], [[guajiras]], some \"[[buler\u00edas]]\" and \"[[ton\u00e1s]]\", and the \"cabales\" (a major type of \"[[siguiriyas]]\"). The minor mode is restricted to the \"[[Farruca]]\", the \"milongas\" (among \"[[cantes de ida y vuelta]]\"), and some styles of \"tangos, buler\u00edas\", etc. In general traditional palos in major and minor mode are limited harmonically to two-chord (tonic\u2013dominant) or three-chord (tonic\u2013subdominant\u2013dominant) progressions . However modern guitarists have introduced [[chord substitution]], transition chords, and even [[modulation (music)|modulation]].\n\"[[Fandangos]]\" and derivative \"palos\" such as \"[[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]]\", \"tarantas\" and \"[[cartageneras]] are bimodal\": guitar introductions are in Phrygian mode while the singing develops in major mode, modulating to Phrygian at the end of the stanza .\nMelody.\nDionisio Preciado, quoted by Sabas de , established the following characteristics for the melodies of flamenco singing:\nMusicologist Hip\u00f3lito Rossy adds the following characteristics :\nComp\u00e1s or Time Signature.\nComp\u00e1s is the Spanish word for [[metre (music)|metre]] or [[time signature]] (in classical [[music theory]]). It also refers to the rhythmic cycle, or layout, of a \"palo\".\nThe comp\u00e1s is fundamental to flamenco. Comp\u00e1s is most often translated as [[rhythm]] but it demands far more precise interpretation than any other Western style of music. If there is no guitarist available, the comp\u00e1s is rendered through hand clapping (\"palmas\") or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (\"rasgueado\") or tapping the [[sound board (music)|soundboard]] (\"golpe\"). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.\nFlamenco uses three basic counts or measures: Binary, Ternary and a form of a twelve-beat cycle that is unique to flamenco. There are also free-form styles including, among others, the [[ton\u00e1s]], [[Saeta (flamenco)|saetas]], [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]], tarantos, and some types of [[fandangos]].\nThere are three types of 12-beat rhythms, which vary in their layouts, or use of accentuations: sole\u00e1, seguiriya and buler\u00eda.\nThe [[Buler\u00edas]] is the emblematic palo of flamenco: today its 12-beat cycle is most often played with accents on the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th beats. The accompanying \"palmas\" are played in groups of 6 beats, giving rise to a multitude of counter-rhythms and percussive voices within the 12 beat comp\u00e1s. In certain regions like, Xerez, Spain, the rhythm stays in a simpler six-count rhythm, only including the twelve count in a musical resolve.\n[[File:Flamenco Compas.theora.ogv|thumb|400 px|none|Flamenco [[Buler\u00edas]] with emphasis as [12] 1 2 [3] 4 5 [6] 7 [8] 9 [10] 11 \u2013 also the rhythm for the song [[America (West Side Story song)|\"America\" from the \"West Side Story\"]]]]\nForms of flamenco expression.\nToque (guitar).\nThe posture and technique of flamenco guitarists, called \"tocaores\", differs from that used by the players of [[Guitar | classical guitar]]. While the classical guitarist supports the guitar on his left leg in an inclined way, the flamenco guitarist usually crosses his legs and supports it on the one that is higher, placing the neck in an almost horizontal position with respect to the ground. Modern guitarists usually use classical guitars, although there is a specific instrument for this genre called [[Guitar #Guitarra de flamenco | flamenco guitar]]. This is less heavy, and its body is narrower than that of the classical guitar, so its sound is lower and does not overshadow the cantaor. It is usually made of [[cypress]] wood, with the handle of [[cedrus|cedar]] and the top of [[fir]]. The cypress gives it a brilliant sound very suitable for the characteristics of flamenco. Formerly, the palo santo from Rio or India was also used, being the first of higher quality, but currently it is in disuse due to its scarcity. The palo santo gave guitars an amplitude of sound especially suitable for solo playing. At present, the most widely used [[headstock]] is the metal one, since the wooden one poses [[Musical tuning|tuning]] problems.\nThe main guitar makers were [[Antonio de Torres | Antonio de Torres Jurado]] ([[Almer\u00eda]], 1817-1892) considered the father of the guitar, [[Manuel Ram\u00edrez de Galarreta]], the Great Ram\u00edrez (Madrid, 1864 -1920), and his disciples Santos Hern\u00e1ndez (Madrid, 1873-1943), who built several guitars for the maestro [[Sabicas]], [[Domingo Esteso]] and [[Modesto Borreguero]]. Also noteworthy are the Conde Brothers, Faustino (1913-1988), Mariano (1916-1989) and Julio (1918-1996), nephews of Domingo Esteso, whose children and heirs continue the saga.\nThe guitarists use the technique of [[alzap\u00faa]], [[Picado (music) | picado]], the [[strum]] and the [[tremolo]], among others. One of the first touches that is considered flamenco, such as the \"ronde\u00f1a\", was the first composition recorded for solo guitar, by [[Juli\u00e1n Arcas]] ([[Mar\u00eda (Almer\u00eda) | Mar\u00eda, Almer\u00eda]], 1832 - [[ Antequera | Antequera, M\u00e1laga]], 1882) in Barcelona in 1860. The strum can be performed with 5, 4 or 3 fingers, the latter invented by [[Sabicas]]. The use of the thumb is also characteristic of flamenco playing. Guitarists rest their thumb on the guitar's soundboard and their index and middle fingers on the string above the one they are playing, thus achieving greater power and sound than the classical guitarist. The middle finger is also placed on the pickguard of the guitar for more precision and strength when plucking the string. Likewise, the use of the pickguard as an element of percussion gives great strength to flamenco guitar playing. The melodic or flourishing phrase that is inserted between the chord sequences intended to accompany the couplet is called \"falseta\". \nThe accompaniment and solo playing of flamenco guitarists is based on both the modal harmonic system and the tonal system, although the most frequent is a combination of both. Some flamenco songs are performed \"a palo seco\" ([[a cappella]]), without guitar accompaniment.\nCante (song).\nAccording to the Royal Spanish Academy, \"cante\" is called the \"action or effect of singing any Andalusian [[singing]]\", defining \"flamenco singing\" as \"agitated Andalusian singing\" and cante jondo as \"the most genuine song. Andalusian, of deep feeling \". The interpreter of flamenco singing is called \" cantaor \" instead of singer, with the [[Andalusian dialect # Loss of the intervocalic / \u00f0 / | loss of the intervocalic characteristic of the Andalusian dialect]].\nThe most important award in flamenco singing is probably the [[Golden Key of Cante]], which has been awarded five times to: [[El Nitri]], [[Manuel Vallejo]], [[Antonio Mairena]], [[Island Shrimp]] and [[Fosforito]].\nThe origins, history and importance of the cante is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[cante flamenco]].\nBaile (dance).\n\"El baile flamenco\" is known for its emotional intensity, proud carriage, expressive use of the arms and rhythmic stamping of the feet, unlike [[tap dance]] or [[Irish dance]] which use different techniques. As with any dance form, many different styles of flamenco have developed.\nIn the twentieth century, flamenco danced informally at gitano (Roma) celebrations in Spain was considered the most \"authentic\" form of flamenco. There was less virtuoso technique in gitano flamenco, but the music and steps are fundamentally the same. The arms are noticeably different from classical flamenco, curving around the head and body rather than extending, often with a bent elbow.\n[[File:Tablao Cordob\u00e9s 06.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Flamenco, C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\"Flamenco puro\" otherwise known as \"flamenco por derecho\" is considered the form of performance flamenco closest to its gitano influences. In this style, the dance is often performed solo, and is based on signals and calls of structural improvisation rather than choreographed. In the improvisational style, castanets are not often used.\n\"Classical flamenco\" is the style most frequently performed by Spanish flamenco dance companies. It is danced largely in a proud and upright style. For women, the back is often held in a marked back bend. Unlike the more gitano influenced styles, there is little movement of the hips, the body is tightly held and the arms are long, like a [[ballet]] dancer. In fact many of the dancers in these companies are trained in Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol more than in the improvisational language of flamenco. Flamenco has both influenced and been influenced by Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol, as evidenced by the fusion of the two ballets created by 'La Argentinita' in the early part of the twentieth century and later, by [[Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]], eventually by the entire Ballet Nacional de Espa\u00f1a et al.\nIn the 1950s [[Jose Greco]] was one of the most famous male Flamenco dancers, performing on stage worldwide and on television including the [[Ed Sullivan Show]], and reviving the art almost singlehandedly. Greco's company left a handful of prominent pioneers, most notably: Maria Benitez and Vicente Romero of New Mexico. Today, there are many centers of Flamenco art. Albuquerque, New Mexico is considered the \"Center of the Nation\" for Flamenco Art. Much of this is due to Maria Benitez's 37 years of sold-out summer seasons. Albuquerque boasts three distinct prominent centers: National Institute of Flamenco, Casa Flamenca and Flamenco Works. Each center dedicates time to daily training, cultural diffusion and world-class performance equaled only to world-class performances one would find in the heart of Southern Spain, Andaluc\u00eda.\nModern flamenco is a highly technical dance style requiring years of study. The emphasis for both male and female performers is on lightning-fast footwork performed with absolute precision. In addition, the dancer may have to dance while using props such as castanets, canes, shawls and fans.\n\"[[New Flamenco|Flamenco nuevo]]\" is a recent marketing phenomenon in Flamenco. Marketed as a \"newer version\" of Flamenco, its roots came from world-music promoters trying to sell albums of artists who created music that \"sounded like\" or had Spanish-style influences. Though some of this music was played in similar pitches, scales and was well-received, it has little to nothing to do with the Art of Flamenco guitar, dance, cante Jondo or the improvisational language. \"Nuevo Flamenco\" consists largely of compositions and repertoire, while Traditional Flamenco music and dance is a language composed of stanzas, actuated by oral formulaic calls and signals.\n[[File:Deborah Greenfield.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Los Angeles, United States]]\nThe flamenco most foreigners are familiar with is a style that was developed as a spectacle for tourists. To add variety, group dances are included and even solos are more likely to be choreographed. The frilly, voluminous spotted dresses are derived from a style of dress worn for the [[Sevillanas]] at the annual [[Seville Fair|Feria]] in [[Seville]].\nIn traditional flamenco, only the very young or older dancers are considered to have the emotional innocence or maturity to adequately convey the \"[[Duende (art)|duende]]\" (soul) of the genre . Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional through techniques early on to take advantage of youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond. One artist that is considered a young master is Juan Manuel Fernandez Montoya, otherwise known as \"Farruquito\". At age 12, Farruquito was considered a pioneer and for \"Flamenco Puro\", or \"Flamenco por Derecho\", because of his emotional depth.\nRegulated teaching of flamenco in educational centers.\nIn Spain, regulated flamenco studies are officially taught in various music conservatories, dance conservatories and music schools in various autonomous communities.\nConservatories of music.\n[[File: CSMCordoba.jpg | thumb | Rafael Orozco Superior Conservatory of Music of C\u00f3rdoba.]]\nFlamenco guitar studies in official educational centers began in Spain in 1988 at the hands of the great concert performer and teacher from Granada [[Manuel Cano Tamayo]], who obtained a position as emeritus professor at the [[Superior Conservatory of Music \"Rafael Orozco\" of C\u00f3rdoba | Superior Conservatory de M\u00fasica Rafael Orozco]] from C\u00f3rdoba.\nThere are specialized flamenco conservatories throughout the country, although mainly in the Andalusia region, such as the aforementioned C\u00f3rdoba Conservatory, the [[Murcia Superior Music Conservatory]] or the [[Superior Music School of Catalonia] ], among others. Outside of Spain, a unique case is the [[Rotterdam Conservatory]], in the [[Netherlands]], which offers regulated flamenco guitar studies under the direction of maestro [[Paco Pe\u00f1a (musician) | Paco Pe\u00f1a] ] since 1985, a few years before they existed in Spain. \nUniversity.\nIn 2018 the first Interuniversity Master's Degree in Flamenco Research and Analysis begins, after the previous attempts of the \"Doctorate Program of Approach to Flamenco\", taught by several universities such as Huelva, Seville, C\u00e1diz and C\u00f3rdoba, among others.\nHistory.\nThe [[Fandango (dance) | fandango]], which in the [[17th century]] was the most widespread song and dance throughout Spain, eventually ended up generating local and regional variants, especially in the province of Huelva. In Alta Andaluc\u00eda and bordering areas the [[Fandango (dance) | fandangos]] were accompanied with the [[bandola]], an instrument with which they accompanied themselves following a regular beat that allowed dancing and from whose name the style derives \" abandoned \". Thus arose the fandangos of [[Lucena]], the [[drones of Puente Genil]], the primitive [[malague\u00f1as]], the [[ronde\u00f1as]], the [[jaberas]], the [[jabegotes] ], the [[verdiales]], the [[chacarr\u00e1]], the [[grana\u00edna]], the [[Taranto (music) | taranto]] and the [[tarantas|taranta]]. Due to the expansion of the Sevillanas in Baja Andalusia, the fandango gradually lost its role as a support for the dance, which allowed the singer to shine and freedom, generating a multitude of fandangos of personal creation in the [[20th century]] . Likewise, thousands of Andalusian peasants, especially from the Eastern Andalusian provinces, emigrated to the mining sites [[Murcia Region | Murcian]], where the [[Taranto (music) | tarantos]] and [[tarantas|taranta]] s evolved. The Tarante de [[Linares (Ja\u00e9n) | Linares]], evolved into the [[Minera (flamenco singing) | mining]] of the Union, the [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] and the [[Levantica]]. At the time of the caf\u00e9s cantantes, some of these cantes were separated from the dance and acquired a free beat, which allowed the performers to show off. The great promoter of this process was [[Antonio Chac\u00f3n (cantaor) | Antonio Chac\u00f3n]], who developed precious versions of malague\u00f1as, granainas and cantes mineros.\nThe stylization of romance and [[cord sheets]] gave rise to [[drae: corrido | corrido]]. The extraction of the romances from quatrains or three significant verses gave rise to the primitive [[ton\u00e1s]], the [[Ca\u00f1a (flamenco) | ca\u00f1a]] and the [[Polo (music) | polo]], which share meter and melody, but differing in their execution. The guitar accompaniment gave them a beat that made them danceable. It is believed that their origin was in [[Ronda District | Ronda]], a city in [[Alta Andaluc\u00eda]] close to [[Baja Andaluc\u00eda]] and closely related to it, and that from there they reached the Sevillian suburb of [ [Triana (Seville) | Triana]], with a great tradition of corridos, where they became the [[Sole\u00e1 (dance) | sole\u00e1]]. From the festive performance of corridos and soleares, the [[Jaleo (cante) | jaleos]] arose in Triana, who traveled to [[Extremadura]] and in Jerez and [[Utrera]] led to the [[Buler\u00eda (music) | buler\u00eda]], from where they spread throughout Baja Andaluc\u00eda, generating local variations.\nLexicon.\nOle.\n[[Adolfo Salazar]] states that the expressive voice \" ole \", with which Andalusian \" cantaores \" and \" bailaores \" are encouraged, can come from the Hebrew verb \" oleh \" which means \"to throw upwards \", showing that the [[dervish]] s gyrovagos of [[Tunisia]] also dance around to the sound of repeated\" ole \"or\" joleh \". The use of the word \"arza\", which is the [[Andalusian dialect | Andalusian dialect form]], of pronouncing the voice [[Imperative mood | imperative]] \"rise\", with the characteristic [[Andalusian dialect # Equalization of / l / and / r / implosives | Andalusian equalization of / l / and / r / implosives]]. The indiscriminate use of the voices \"arza\" and \"ole\" is frequent when it comes to \" jalear \" &lt;ref&gt;, but the most evidence of the origin of this word can be from the cal\u00f3: \" Ol\u00e1 \", which means \" Come \". Likewise, in Andalusia it is known as jaleo al ojeo de hunt, that is, the act of glancing, which is \"driving away the game with voices, shots, blows or noise, so that they \" get up \"\". \nDuende.\nAccording to the RAE dictionary (1956!) The \"duende\" in Andalusia is a \"mysterious and ineffable charm\", a charisma that the Gitanos call duende. [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], in his lecture \"Teor\u00eda y juego del duende\" confirms this ineffability of the duende by defining it with the following words from Goethe: \"Mysterious power that everyone feels and that no philosopher explains\". In the flamenco imaginary, the duende goes beyond technique and inspiration, in Lorca's words \"To search for the duende there is no map or exercise\". When a flamenco artist experiences the arrival of this mysterious charm, the expressions \"have duende\" or sing, play or dance \"with duende\" are used.\nAlong with those previously mentioned, there are many other words and expressions characteristic of the flamenco genre, such as \"tablao flamenco\", \"tablao flamenco\", \"flamenco spree\", \"third\", \"aflamencar\", \"flamenco\", \"flamenco\"...\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Flamenco| ]]\n[[Category:Spanish music]]\n[[Category:Andalusian music]]\n[[Category:Romani dances]]\n[[Category:Spanish dances]]\n[[Category:Spanish folk music]]\n[[Category:European folk dances]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]"}
{"id": "11561", "revid": "6545302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11561", "title": "Father Christmas", "text": "Father Christmas is the traditional English name for the personification of Christmas. Although now known as a Christmas gift-bringer, and typically considered to be synonymous with Santa Claus, he was originally part of a much older and unrelated English folkloric tradition. The recognisably modern figure of the English Father Christmas developed in the late Victorian period, but Christmas had been personified for centuries before then.\nEnglish personifications of Christmas were first recorded in the 15th century, with Father Christmas himself first appearing in the mid 17th century in the aftermath of the English Civil War. The Puritan-controlled English government had legislated to abolish Christmas, considering it papist, and had outlawed its traditional customs. Royalist political pamphleteers, linking the old traditions with their cause, adopted Old Father Christmas as the symbol of 'the good old days' of feasting and good cheer. Following the Restoration in 1660, Father Christmas's profile declined. His character was maintained during the late 18th and into the 19th century by the Christmas folk plays later known as mummers plays.\nUntil Victorian times, Father Christmas was concerned with adult feasting and merry-making. He had no particular connection with children, nor with the giving of presents, nocturnal visits, stockings, chimneys or reindeer. But as later Victorian Christmases developed into child-centric family festivals, Father Christmas became a bringer of gifts. \nThe popular American myth of Santa Claus arrived in England in the 1850s and Father Christmas started to take on Santa's attributes. By the 1880s the new customs had become established, with the nocturnal visitor sometimes being known as Santa Claus and sometimes as Father Christmas. He was often illustrated wearing a long red hooded gown trimmed with white fur.\nAny residual distinctions between Father Christmas and Santa Claus largely faded away in the early years of the 20th century, and modern dictionaries consider the terms Father Christmas and Santa Claus to be synonymous.\nEarly midwinter celebrations.\nThe custom of merrymaking and feasting at Christmastide first appears in the historical record during the High Middle Ages (c 1100\u20131300). This almost certainly represented a continuation of pre-Christian midwinter celebrations in Britain of which\u2014as the historian Ronald Hutton has pointed out\u2014\"we have no details at all.\" Personifications came later, and when they did they reflected the existing custom.\n15th century\u2014the first English personifications of Christmas.\nThe first known English personification of Christmas was associated with merry-making, singing and drinking. A carol attributed to Richard Smart, Rector of Plymtree in Devon from 1435 to 1477, has 'Sir Christemas' announcing the news of Christ's birth and encouraging his listeners to drink: \"\"Buvez bien par toute la compagnie\", / Make good cheer and be right merry, / And sing with us now joyfully: Nowell, nowell.\"\nMany late medieval Christmas customs incorporated both sacred and secular themes. In Norwich in January 1443, at a traditional battle between the flesh and the spirit (represented by Christmas and Lent), John Gladman, crowned and disguised as 'King of Christmas', rode behind a pageant of the months \"disguysed as the seson requird\" on a horse decorated with tinfoil.\n16th century\u2014feasting, entertainment and music.\nIn most of England the archaic word 'Yule' had been replaced by 'Christmas' by the 11th century, but in some places 'Yule' survived as the normal dialect term. The City of York maintained an annual St Thomas's Day celebration of \"The Riding of Yule and his Wife\" which involved a figure representing Yule who carried bread and a leg of lamb. In 1572 the riding was suppressed on the orders of the Archbishop, who complained of the \"undecent and uncomely disguising\" which drew multitudes of people from divine service.\nSuch personifications, illustrating the medieval fondness for pageantry and symbolism, extended throughout the Tudor and Stuart periods with Lord of Misrule characters, sometimes called 'Captain Christmas', 'Prince Christmas' or 'The Christmas Lord', presiding over feasting and entertainment in grand houses, university colleges and Inns of Court.\"\nIn his allegorical play \"Summer's Last Will and Testament\", written in about 1592, Thomas Nashe introduces for comic effect a miserly Christmas character who refuses to keep the feast. He is reminded by Summer of the traditional role that he ought to be playing: \"Christmas, how chance thou com\u2019st not as the rest, / Accompanied with some music, or some song? / A merry carol would have graced thee well; / Thy ancestors have used it heretofore.\"\n17th century\u2014religion and politics.\nPuritan criticisms.\nEarly 17th century writers used the techniques of personification and allegory as a means of defending Christmas from attacks by radical Protestants.\nResponding to a perceived decline in the levels of Christmas hospitality provided by the gentry, Ben Jonson in \"Christmas, His Masque\" (1616) dressed his Old Christmas in out-of-date fashions: \"attir'd in round Hose, long Stockings, a close Doublet, a high crownd Hat with a Broach, a long thin beard, a Truncheon, little Ruffes, white shoes, his Scarffes, and Garters tyed crosse\". Surrounded by guards, Christmas asserts his rightful place in the Protestant Church and protests against attempts to exclude him: \"Why Gentlemen, doe you know what you doe? ha! would you ha'kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas? Christmas of London, and Captaine Christmas? ... they would not let me in: I must come another time! a good jeast, as if I could come more then once a yeare; why, I am no dangerous person, and so I told my friends, o'the Guard. I am old Gregorie Christmas still, and though I come out of Popes-head-alley as good a Protestant, as any i'my Parish.\"\nThe stage directions to \"The Springs Glorie\", a 1638 court masque by Thomas Nabbes, state, \"Christmas is personated by an old reverend Gentleman in a furr'd gown and cappe &amp;c.\" Shrovetide and Christmas dispute precedence, and Shrovetide issues a challenge: \"I say Christmas you are past date, you are out of the Almanack. Resigne, resigne.\" To which Christmas responds: \"Resigne to thee! I that am the King of good cheere and feasting, though I come but once a yeare to raigne over bak't, boyled, roast and plum-porridge, will have being in despight of thy lard-ship.\"\nThis sort of character was to feature repeatedly over the next 250 years in pictures, stage plays and folk dramas. Initially known as 'Sir Christmas' or 'Lord Christmas', he later became increasingly referred to as 'Father Christmas'.\nPuritan revolution\u2014enter 'Father Christmas'.\nThe rise of puritanism led to accusations of popery in connection with pre-reformation Christmas traditions. When the Puritans took control of government in the mid-1640s they made concerted efforts to abolish Christmas and to outlaw its traditional customs. For 15 years from around 1644, before and during the Interregnum of 1649-1660, the celebration of Christmas in England was forbidden. The suppression was given greater legal weight from June 1647 when parliament passed an \"Ordinance for Abolishing of Festivals\" which formally abolished Christmas in its entirety, along with the other traditional church festivals of Easter and Whitsun.\nIt was in this context that Royalist pamphleteers linked the old traditions of Christmas with the cause of King and Church, while radical puritans argued for the suppression of Christmas both in its religious and its secular aspects. In the hands of Royalist pamphlet writers, Old Father Christmas served as the symbol and spokesman of 'the good old days' of feasting and good cheer, and it became popular for Christmastide's defenders to present him as lamenting past times.\n\"The Arraignment, Conviction and Imprisoning of Christmas\" (January 1646) describes a discussion between a town crier and a Royalist gentlewoman enquiring after Old Father Christmas who 'is gone from hence'. Its anonymous author, a parliamentarian, presents Father Christmas in a negative light, concentrating on his allegedly popish attributes: \"For age, this hoarie headed man was of great yeares, and as white as snow; he entred the Romish Kallender time out of mind; [he] is old ...; he was full and fat as any dumb Docter of them all. He looked under the consecrated Laune sleeves as big as Bul-beefe ... but, since the catholike liquor is taken from him, he is much wasted, so that he hath looked very thin and ill of late ... But yet some other markes that you may know him by, is that the wanton Women dote after him; he helped them to so many new Gownes, Hatts, and Hankerches, and other fine knacks, of which he hath a pack on his back, in which is good store of all sorts, besides the fine knacks that he got out of their husbands' pockets for household provisions for him. He got Prentises, Servants, and Schollars many play dayes, and therefore was well beloved by them also, and made all merry with Bagpipes, Fiddles, and other musicks, Giggs, Dances, and Mummings.\"\nThe character of 'Christmas' (also called 'father Christmas') speaks in a pamphlet of 1652, immediately after the English Civil War, published anonymously by the satirical Royalist poet John Taylor: \"The Vindication of Christmas or, His Twelve Yeares' Observations upon the Times\". A frontispiece illustrates an old, bearded Christmas in a brimmed hat, a long open robe and undersleeves. Christmas laments the pitiful quandary he has fallen into since he came into \"this headlesse countrey\". \"I was in good hope that so long a misery would have made them glad to bid a merry Christmas welcome. But welcome or not welcome, I am come...\" He concludes with a verse: \"Lets dance and sing, and make good chear, / For Christmas comes but once a year.\"\nIn 1658 Josiah King published \"The Examination and Tryall of Old Father Christmas\" (the earliest citation for the specific term 'Father Christmas' recognised by the Oxford English Dictionary). King portrays Father Christmas as a white-haired old man who is on trial for his life based on evidence laid against him by the Commonwealth. Father Christmas's counsel mounts the defence: \"Me thinks my Lord, the very Clouds blush, to see this old Gentleman thus egregiously abused. if at any time any have abused themselves by immoderate eating, and drinking or otherwise spoil the creatures, it is none of this old mans fault; neither ought he to suffer for it; for example the Sun and the Moon are by the heathens worship\u2019d are they therefore bad because idolized? so if any abuse this old man, they are bad for abusing him, not he bad, for being abused.\" The jury acquits.\nRestoration.\nFollowing the Restoration in 1660, most traditional Christmas celebrations were revived, although as these were no longer contentious the historic documentary sources become fewer.\nIn 1678 Josiah King reprinted his 1658 pamphlet with additional material. In this version, the restored Father Christmas is looking better: \"[he] look't so smug and pleasant, his cherry cheeks appeared through his thin milk white locks, like [b]lushing Roses vail'd with snow white Tiffany ... the true Emblem of Joy and Innocence.\"\n\"Old Christmass Returnd\", a ballad collected by Samuel Pepys, celebrated the revival of festivities in the latter part of the century: \"Old Christmass is come for to keep open house / He scorns to be guilty of starving a mouse, / Then come boyes and welcome, for dyet the chief / Plumb pudding, Goose, Capon, minc't pies &amp; Roast beef\".\n18th century\u2014a low profile.\nAs interest in Christmas customs waned, Father Christmas's profile declined. He still continued to be regarded as Christmas's presiding spirit, although his occasional earlier associations with the Lord of Misrule died out with the disappearance of the Lord of Misrule himself. The historian Ronald Hutton notes, \"after a taste of genuine misrule during the Interregnum nobody in the ruling elite seems to have had any stomach for simulating it.\" Hutton also found \"patterns of entertainment at late Stuart Christmases are remarkably timeless [and] nothing very much seems to have altered during the next century either.\" The diaries of 18th and early 19th century clergy take little note of any Christmas traditions.\nIn \"The Country Squire\", a play of 1732, Old Christmas is depicted as someone who is rarely-found: a generous squire. The character Scabbard remarks, \"Men are grown so ... stingy, now-a-days, that there is scarce One, in ten Parishes, makes any House-keeping. ... Squire Christmas ... keeps a good House, or else I do not know of One besides.\" When invited to spend Christmas with the squire, he comments \"I will ... else I shall forget Christmas, for aught I see.\" Similar opinions were expressed in \"Round About Our Coal Fire ... with some curious Memories of Old Father Christmas; Shewing what Hospitality was in former Times, and how little there remains of it at present\" (1734, reprinted with Father Christmas subtitle 1796).\nDavid Garrick's popular 1774 Drury Lane production of \"A Christmas Tale\" included a personified Christmas character who announced \"Behold a personage well known to fame; / Once lov'd and honour'd \u2013 Christmas is my name! /.../ I, English hearts rejoic'd in days of yore; / for new strange modes, imported by the score, / You will not sure turn Christmas out of door!\"\nEarly records of folk plays.\nBy the late 18th century Father Christmas had become a stock character in the Christmas folk plays later known as mummers plays. During the following century they became probably the most widespread of all calendar customs. Hundreds of villages had their own mummers who performed traditional plays around the neighbourhood, especially at the big houses. Father Christmas appears as a character in plays of the Southern England type, being mostly confined to plays from the south and west of England and Wales. His ritual opening speech is characterised by variants of a couplet closely reminiscent of John Taylor's \"But welcome or not welcome, I am come...\" from 1652.\nThe oldest extant speech is from Truro, Cornwall in the late 1780s:\n19th century\u2014revival.\nDuring the Victorian period Christmas customs enjoyed a significant revival, including the figure of Father Christmas himself as the emblem of 'good cheer'. His physical appearance at this time became more variable, and he was by no means always portrayed as the old and bearded figure imagined by 17th century writers.\n'Merry England' view of Christmas.\nIn his poem \"Marmion\" of 1808 Walter Scott wrote\nScott's phrase Merry England has been adopted by historians to describe the romantic notion that there was a golden age of the English past, allegedly since lost, that was characterised by universal hospitality and charity. The notion had a profound influence on the way that popular customs were seen, and most of the 19th century writers who bemoaned the state of contemporary Christmases were, at least to some extent, yearning for the mythical Merry England version.\nThomas Hervey's \"The Book of Christmas\" (1836), illustrated by Robert Seymour, exemplifies this view. In Hervey's personification of the lost charitable festival, \"Old Father Christmas, at the head of his numerous and uproarious family, might ride his goat through the streets of the city and the lanes of the village, but he dismounted to sit for some few moments by each man's hearth; while some one or another of his merry sons would break away, to visit the remote farm-houses or show their laughing faces at many a poor man's door.\" Seymour's illustration shows Old Christmas dressed in a fur gown, crowned with a holly wreath, and riding a yule goat.\nIn an extended allegory, Hervey imagines his contemporary Old Father Christmas as a white-bearded magician dressed in a long robe and crowned with holly. His children are identified as Roast Beef (Sir Loin) and his faithful squire or bottle-holder Plum Pudding; the slender figure of Wassail with her fount of perpetual youth; a 'tricksy spirit' who bears the bowl and is on the best of terms with the Turkey; Mumming; Misrule, with a feather in his cap; the Lord of Twelfth Night under a state-canopy of cake and wearing his ancient crown; Saint Distaff looking like an old maid (\"she used to be a sad romp; but her merriest days we fear are over\"); Carol singing; the Waits; and the twin-faced Janus.\nHervey ends by lamenting the lost \"uproarious merriment\" of Christmas, and calls on his readers \"who know anything of the 'old, old, very old, gray-bearded gentleman' or his family to aid us in our search after them; and with their good help we will endeavor to restore them to some portion of their ancient honors in England\".\nFather Christmas or Old Christmas, represented as a jolly-faced bearded man often surrounded by plentiful food and drink, started to appear regularly in illustrated magazines of the 1840s. He was dressed in a variety of costumes and usually had holly on his head, as in these illustrations from the \"Illustrated London News\":\nCharles Dickens's 1843 novel \"A Christmas Carol\" was highly influential, and has been credited both with reviving interest in Christmas in England and with shaping the themes attached to it. A famous image from the novel is John Leech's illustration of the 'Ghost of Christmas Present'. Although not explicitly named Father Christmas, the character wears a holly wreath, is shown sitting among food, drink and wassail bowl, and is dressed in the traditional loose furred gown\u2014but in green rather than the red that later become ubiquitous.\nLater 19th century mumming.\nOld Father Christmas continued to make his annual appearance in Christmas folk plays throughout the 19th century, his appearance varying considerably according to local custom. Sometimes, as in Hervey's book of 1836, he was portrayed (below left) as a hunchback.\nOne unusual portrayal (below centre) was described several times by William Sandys between 1830 and 1852, all in essentially the same terms: \"Father Christmas is represented as a grotesque old man, with a large mask and comic wig, and a huge club in his hand.\" This representation is considered by the folklore scholar Peter Millington to be the result of the southern Father Christmas replacing the northern Beelzebub character in a hybrid play. A spectator to a Worcestershire version of the \"St George\" play in 1856 noted, \"Beelzebub was identical with Old Father Christmas.\"\nA mummers play mentioned in \"The Book of Days\" (1864) opened with \"Old Father Christmas, bearing, as emblematic devices, the holly bough, wassail-bowl, &amp;c\". A corresponding illustration (below right) shows the character wearing not only a holly wreath but also a gown with a hood.\nIn a Hampshire folk play of 1860 Father Christmas is portrayed as a disabled soldier: \"[he] wore breeches and stockings, carried a begging-box, and conveyed himself upon two sticks; his arms were striped with chevrons like a noncommissioned officer.\"\nIn the latter part of the 19th century and the early years of the next the folk play tradition in England rapidly faded, and the plays almost died out after the First World War taking their ability to influence the character of Father Christmas with them.\nFather Christmas as gift-giver.\nIn pre-Victorian personifications, Father Christmas had been concerned essentially with adult feasting and games. He had no particular connection with children, nor with the giving of presents. But as Victorian Christmases developed into family festivals centred mainly on children, Father Christmas started to be associated with the giving of gifts.\nThe Cornish Quaker diarist Barclay Fox relates a family party given on 26 December 1842 that featured \"the venerable effigies of Father Christmas with scarlet coat &amp; cocked hat, stuck all over with presents for the guests, by his side the old year, a most dismal &amp; haggard old beldame in a night cap and spectacles, then 1843 [the new year], a promising baby asleep in a cradle\".\nIn Britain, the first evidence of a child writing letters to Father Christmas requesting gift has been found in 1895.\nSanta Claus crosses the Atlantic.\nThe figure of Santa Claus had originated in the US, drawing at least partly upon Dutch St Nicolas traditions. A New York publication of 1821, \"A New-Year\u2019s Present\", contained an illustrated poem \"Old Santeclaus with Much Delight\" in which a Santa figure on a reindeer sleigh brings presents for good children and a \"long, black birchen rod\" for use on the bad ones. In 1823 came the famous poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\", usually attributed to the New York writer Clement Clarke Moore, which developed the character further. Moore's poem became immensely popular and Santa Claus customs, initially localized in the Dutch American areas, were becoming general in the United States by the middle of the century.\nThe January 1848 edition of \"Howitt's Journal of Literature and Popular Progress\", published in London, carried an illustrated article entitled \"New Year's Eve in Different Nations\". This noted that one of the chief features of the American New Year's Eve was a custom carried over from the Dutch, namely the arrival of Santa Claus with gifts for the children. Santa Claus is \"no other than the Pelz Nickel of Germany ... the good Saint Nicholas of Russia ... He arrives in Germany about a fortnight before Christmas, but as may be supposed from all the visits he has to pay there, and the length of his voyage, he does not arrive in America, until this eve.\"\nIn 1851 advertisements began appearing in Liverpool newspapers for a new transatlantic passenger service to and from New York aboard the Eagle Line's ship \"Santa Claus\", and returning visitors and emigrants to the British Isles on this and other vessels will have been familiar with the American figure. There were some early adoptions in Britain. A Scottish reference has Santa Claus leaving presents on New Year's Eve 1852, with children \"hanging their stockings up on each side of the fire-place, in their sleeping apartments, at night, and waiting patiently till morning, to see what Santa Claus puts into them during their slumbers\". In Ireland in 1853, on the other hand, presents were being left on Christmas Eve according to a character in a newspaper short story who says \"...\u00a0tomorrow will be Christmas. What will Santa Claus bring us?\" A poem published in Belfast in 1858 includes the lines \"The children sleep; they dream of him, the fairy, / Kind Santa Claus, who with a right good will / Comes down the chimney with a footstep airy ...\"\n\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" was published in England in December 1853 in \"Notes and Queries\". An explanatory note states that the St Nicholas figure is known as Santa Claus in New York State and as Krishkinkle in Pennsylvania.\n1854 marked the first English publication of \"Carl Krinkin; or, The Christmas Stocking\" by the popular American author Susan Warner. The novel was published three times in London in 1854\u20135, and there were several later editions. Characters in the book include both Santa Claus (complete with sleigh, stocking and chimney), leaving presents on Christmas Eve and\u2014separately\u2014Old Father Christmas. The Stocking of the title tells of how in England, \"a great many years ago\", it saw Father Christmas enter with his traditional refrain \"Oh! here come I, old father Christmas, welcome or not ...\" He wore a crown of yew and ivy, and he carried a long staff topped with holly-berries. His dress \"was a long brown robe which fell down about his feet, and on it were sewed little spots of white cloth to represent snow\".\nMerger with Santa Claus.\nAs the US-inspired customs became popular in England, Father Christmas started to take on Santa's attributes. His costume became more standardised, and although depictions often still showed him carrying holly, the holly crown became rarer and was often replaced with a hood. It still remained common, though, for Father Christmas and Santa Claus to be distinguished, and as late as the 1890s there were still examples of the old-style Father Christmas appearing without any of the new American features.\nAppearances in public.\nThe blurring of public roles occurred quite rapidly. In an 1854 newspaper description of the public Boxing Day festivities in Luton, Bedfordshire, a gift-giving Father Christmas/Santa Claus figure was already being described as 'familiar': \"On the right-hand side was Father Christmas's bower, formed of evergreens, and in front was the proverbial Yule log, glistening in the snow ... He wore a great furry white coat and cap, and a long white beard and hair spoke to his hoar antiquity. Behind his bower he had a large selection of fancy articles which formed the gifts he distributed to holders of prize tickets from time to time during the day ... Father Christmas bore in his hand a small Christmas tree laden with bright little gifts and bon-bons, and altogether he looked like the familiar Santa Claus or Father Christmas of the picture book.\" Discussing the shops of Regent Street in London, another writer noted in December of that year, \"you may fancy yourself in the abode of Father Christmas or St. Nicholas himself.\"\nDuring the 1860s and 70s Father Christmas became a popular subject on Christmas cards, where he was shown in many different costumes. Sometimes he gave presents and sometimes received them.\nAn illustrated article of 1866 explained the concept of \"The Cave of Mystery\". In an imagined children's party this took the form of a recess in the library which evoked \"dim visions of the cave of Aladdin\" and was \"well filled ... with all that delights the eye, pleases the ear, or tickles the fancy of children\". The young guests \"tremblingly await the decision of the improvised Father Christmas, with his flowing grey beard, long robe, and slender staff\".\nFrom the 1870s onwards, Christmas shopping had begun to evolve as a separate seasonal activity, and by the late 19th century it had become an important part of the English Christmas. The purchasing of toys, especially from the new department stores, became strongly associated with the season. The first retail Christmas Grotto was set up in JR Robert's store in Stratford, London in December 1888, and shopping arenas for children\u2014often called 'Christmas Bazaars'\u2014spread rapidly during the 1890s and 1900s, helping to assimilate Father Christmas/Santa Claus into society.\nSometimes the two characters continued to be presented as separate, as in a procession at the Olympia Exhibition of 1888 in which both Father Christmas and Santa Claus took part, with Little Red Riding Hood and other children's characters in between. At other times the characters were conflated: in 1885 Mr Williamson's London Bazaar in Sunderland was reported to be a \"Temple of juvenile delectation and delight. In the well-lighted window is a representation of Father Christmas, with the printed intimation that 'Santa Claus is arranging within.'\"\nEven after the appearance of the store grotto, it was still not firmly established who should hand out gifts at parties. A writer in the \"Illustrated London News\" of December 1888 suggested that a Sibyl should dispense gifts from a 'snow cave', but a little over a year later she had changed her recommendation to a gypsy in a 'magic cave'. Alternatively, the hostess could \"have Father Christmas arrive, towards the end of the evening, with a sack of toys on his back. He must have a white head and a long white beard, of course. Wig and beard can be cheaply hired from a theatrical costumier, or may be improvised from tow in case of need. He should wear a greatcoat down to his heels, liberally sprinkled with flour as though he had just come from that land of ice where Father Christmas is supposed to reside.\"\nAs secret nocturnal visitor.\nThe nocturnal visitor aspect of the American myth took much longer to become naturalised. From the 1840s it had been accepted readily enough that presents were left for children by unseen hands overnight on Christmas Eve, but the receptacle was a matter of debate, as was the nature of the visitor. Dutch tradition had St Nicholas leaving presents in shoes laid out on 6 December, while in France shoes were filled by P\u00e8re No\u00ebl. The older shoe custom and the newer American stocking custom trickled only slowly into Britain, with writers and illustrators remaining uncertain for many years. Although the stocking eventually triumphed, the shoe custom had still not been forgotten by 1901 when an illustration entitled \"Did you see Santa Claus, Mother?\" was accompanied by the verse \"Her Christmas dreams / Have all come true; / Stocking o'erflows / and likewise shoe.\"\nBefore Santa Claus and the stocking became ubiquitous, one English tradition had been for fairies to visit on Christmas Eve to leave gifts in shoes set out in front of the fireplace.\nAspects of the American Santa Claus myth were sometimes adopted in isolation and applied to Father Christmas. In a short fantasy piece, the editor of the \"Cheltenham Chronicle\" in 1867 dreamt of being seized by the collar by Father Christmas, \"rising up like a Geni of the Arabian Nights ... and moving rapidly through the \"aether\"\". Hovering over the roof of a house, Father Christmas cries 'Open Sesame' to have the roof roll back to disclose the scene within.\nIt was not until the 1870s that the tradition of a nocturnal Santa Claus began to be adopted by ordinary people. A poem \"The Baby's Stocking\" that was syndicated to local newspapers in 1871 took it for granted that readers would be familiar with the custom, and would understand the joke that the stocking might be missed as \"Santa Claus wouldn't be looking for anything half so small.\" On the other hand, when \"The Preston Guardian\" published its poem \"Santa Claus and the Children\" in 1877 it felt the need to include a long preface explaining exactly who Santa Claus was.\nFolklorists and antiquarians were not, it seems, familiar with the new local customs and Ronald Hutton notes that in 1879 the newly formed Folk-Lore Society, ignorant of American practices, was still \"excitedly trying to discover the source of the new belief\".\nIn January 1879 the antiquarian Edwin Lees wrote to \"Notes and Queries\" seeking information about an observance he had been told about by 'a country person': \"On Christmas Eve, when the inmates of a house in the country retire to bed, all those desirous of a present place a stocking outside the door of their bedroom, with the expectation that some mythical being called Santiclaus will fill the stocking or place something within it before the morning. This is of course well known, and the master of the house does in reality place a Christmas gift secretly in each stocking; but the giggling girls in the morning, when bringing down their presents, affect to say that Santiclaus visited and filled the stockings in the night. From what region of the earth or air this benevolent Santiclaus takes flight I have not been able to ascertain ...\" Lees received several responses, linking 'Santiclaus' with the continental traditions of St Nicholas and 'Petit Jesus' (Christkind), but no-one mentioned Father Christmas and no-one was correctly able to identify the American source.\nBy the 1880s the American myth had become firmly established in the popular English imagination, the nocturnal visitor sometimes being known as Santa Claus and sometimes as Father Christmas (often complete with a hooded robe). An 1881 poem imagined a child awaiting a visit from Santa Claus and asking \"Will he come like Father Christmas, / Robed in green and beard all white? / Will he come amid the darkness? / Will he come at all tonight?\" The French writer Max O'Rell, who evidently thought the custom was established in the England of 1883, explained that Father Christmas \"descend par la chemin\u00e9e, pour remplir de bonbons et de joux les bas que les enfants ont suspendus au pied du lit.\" [comes down the chimney, to fill with sweets and games the stockings that the children have hung from the foot of the bed]. And in her poem \"Agnes: A Fairy Tale\" (1891), Lilian M Bennett treats the two names as interchangeable: \"Old Santa Claus is exceedingly kind, / but he won't come to Wide-awakes, you will find... / Father Christmas won't come if he can hear / You're awake. So to bed my bairnies dear.\" The commercial availability from 1895 of Tom Smith &amp; Co's \"Santa Claus Surprise Stockings\" indicates how deeply the American myth had penetrated English society by the end of the century.\nRepresentations of the developing character at this period were sometimes labelled 'Santa Claus' and sometimes 'Father Christmas', with a tendency for the latter still to allude to old-style associations with charity and with food and drink, as in several of these \"Punch\" illustrations:\n20th century.\nAny residual distinctions between Father Christmas and Santa Claus largely faded away in the early years of the new century, and it was reported in 1915, \"The majority of children to-day ... do not know of any difference between our old Father Christmas and the comparatively new Santa Claus, as, by both wearing the same garb, they have effected a happy compromise.\"\nIt took many years for authors and illustrators to agree that Father Christmas's costume should be portrayed as red\u2014although that was always the most common colour\u2014and he could sometimes be found in a gown of brown, green, blue or white. Mass media approval of the red costume came following a Coca-Cola advertising campaign that was launched in 1931.\nFather Christmas's common form for much of the 20th century was described by his entry in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". He is \"the personification of Christmas as a benevolent old man with a flowing white beard, wearing a red sleeved gown and hood trimmed with white fur, and carrying a sack of Christmas presents\". One of the OED's sources is a 1919 cartoon in \"Punch\", reproduced here. The caption reads:\nIn 1951 an editorial in \"The Times\" opined that while most adults may be under the impression that [the English] Father Christmas is home-bred, and is \"a good insular John Bull old gentleman\", many children, \"led away ... by the false romanticism of sledges and reindeer\", post letters to Norway addressed simply to Father Christmas or, \"giving him a foreign veneer, Santa Claus\".\nDifferences between the English and US representations were discussed in \"The Illustrated London News\" of 1985. The classic illustration by the US artist Thomas Nast was held to be \"the authorised version of how Santa Claus should look\u2014in America, that is.\" In Britain, people were said to stick to the older Father Christmas, with a long robe, large concealing beard, and boots similar to Wellingtons.\nFather Christmas appeared in many 20th century English-language works of fiction, including J. R. R. Tolkien's \"Father Christmas Letters\", a series of private letters to his children written between 1920 and 1942 and first published in 1976. Other 20th century publications include C. S. Lewis's \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" (1950), Raymond Briggs's \"Father Christmas\" (1973) and its sequel \"Father Christmas Goes on Holiday\" (1975). The character was also celebrated in popular songs, including \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" by Greg Lake (1974) and \"Father Christmas\" by The Kinks (1977).\nIn 1991, Raymond Briggs's two books were adapted as an animated short film, Father Christmas, starring Mel Smith as the voice of the title character.\n21st century.\nModern dictionaries consider the terms Father Christmas and Santa Claus to be synonymous. The respective characters are now to all intents and purposes indistinguishable, although some people are still said to prefer the term 'Father Christmas' over 'Santa', nearly 150 years after Santa's arrival in England. According to \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" (19th edn, 2012), Father Christmas is considered to be \"[a] British rather than a US name for Santa Claus, associating him specifically with Christmas. The name carries a somewhat socially superior cachet and is thus preferred by certain advertisers.\""}

This government is variously known as the Union, the United States, or the federal government.\nUnder the Constitution and various treaties, the legal jurisdiction of the United States includes territories and territorial waters.\nLegislative Branch.\nOne aspect of federal jurisdiction is the extent of legislative power. Under the Constitution, Congress has power to legislate only in the areas that are delegated to it. Under clause 17 however, Congress has power to \"exercise exclusive Legislation in all cases whatsoever\" over the federal district (Washington, D.C.) and other territory ceded to the federal government by the states, such as for military installations.\nFederal jurisdiction in this sense is important in criminal law because federal law does not supersede state criminal law. Congress has enacted the Assimilative Crimes Act (), which provides that any act that would have been a crime under the laws of the state in which a federal enclave is situated is also a federal crime. As most such enclaves are occupied by the military, military law is especially concerned with these enclaves, especially the issue of establishing who has jurisdiction and what type of jurisdiction. In such areas, the federal government may have proprietary jurisdiction (rights as landowner), concurrent jurisdiction (with federal and state law applicable), or exclusive jurisdiction over the land where an act was committed. Courts-martial involving military members subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice apply regardless of location.\nArticle Four of the United States Constitution also states that the Congress has the power to enact laws \"respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.\" Federal jurisdiction exists over any territory thus subject to laws enacted by the Congress.\nJudicial branch.\nThe American legal system includes both state courts and federal courts. State courts hear cases involving state law, and such federal laws as are not restricted to hearing in federal courts. Federal courts may only hear cases where federal jurisdiction can be established. Specifically, the court must have both subject-matter jurisdiction over the matter of the claim and personal jurisdiction over the parties.\nThe Federal Courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, meaning that they only exercise powers granted to them by the Constitution and Federal Laws. There are several forms of subject-matter jurisdiction, but the two most commonly appealed to are federal-question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction. Federal question jurisdiction is available when the plaintiff raises a claim that arises under the laws, treaties, or Constitution of the United States, as opposed to claims arising under state law. By the \"Well-Pleaded Complaint\" rule, federal question jurisdiction is not available if the federal issue arises only as a defense to a state-law claim. Diversity jurisdiction, on the other hand, is available regarding state-law claims if every plaintiff is from a different state from every defendant (the requirement for so-called complete or total diversity) and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\nIf a Federal Court has subject matter jurisdiction over one or more of the claims in a case, it has discretion to exercise ancillary jurisdiction over other state law claims.\nThe Supreme Court has \"cautioned that ... Court[s] must take great care to 'resist the temptation' to express preferences about [certain types of cases] in the form of jurisdictional rules. Judges must strain to remove the influence of the merits from their jurisdictional rules. The law of jurisdiction must remain apart from the world upon which it operates\".\nGenerally, when a case has successfully overcome the hurdles of standing, Case or Controversy and State Action, it will be heard by a trial court. The non-governmental party may raise claims or defenses relating to alleged constitutional violation(s) by the government. If the non-governmental party loses, the constitutional issue may form part of the appeal. Eventually, a petition for certiorari may be sent to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants certiorari and accepts the case, it will receive written briefs from each side (and any amici curiae or friends of the court\u2014usually interested third parties with some expertise to bear on the subject) and schedule oral arguments. The Justices will closely question both parties. When the Court renders its decision, it will generally do so in a single majority opinion and one or more dissenting opinions. Each opinion sets forth the facts, prior decisions, and legal reasoning behind the position taken. The majority opinion constitutes binding precedent on all lower courts; when faced with very similar facts, they are bound to apply the same reasoning or face reversal of their decision by a higher court."}

The frequency of an oscillator is altered \"in accordance with the amplitude of a modulating signal\". \nFM synthesis can create both harmonic and inharmonic sounds. To synthesize harmonic sounds, the modulating signal must have a harmonic relationship to the original carrier signal. As the amount of frequency modulation increases, the sound grows progressively complex. Through the use of modulators with frequencies that are non-integer multiples of the carrier signal (i.e. inharmonic), inharmonic bell-like and percussive spectra can be created.\nFM synthesis using analog oscillators may result in pitch instability. However, FM synthesis can also be implemented digitally, which is more stable and became standard practice. Digital FM synthesis (implemented as phase modulation) was the basis of several musical instruments beginning as early as 1974. Yamaha built the first prototype digital synthesizer in 1974, based on FM synthesis, before commercially releasing the Yamaha GS-1 in 1980. The Synclavier I, manufactured by New England Digital Corporation beginning in 1978, included a digital FM synthesizer, using an FM synthesis algorithm licensed from Yamaha. Yamaha's groundbreaking DX7 synthesizer, released in 1983, brought FM to the forefront of synthesis in the mid-1980s.\nFM synthesis had also become the usual setting for games and software until the mid-nineties. Through sound cards like the AdLib and Sound Blaster, IBM PCs popularized Yamaha chips like OPL2 and OPL3. OPNB was used as main basic sound generator board in SNK Neo Geo operated arcades (MVS) and home console (AES). Later variant in use for Taito Z System. The related OPN2 was used in the Fujitsu FM Towns Marty and Sega Genesis as one of its sound generator chips. Similarly, Sharp X68000 and MSX (Yamaha computer unit) also use FM-based soundchip, OPM.\nHistory.\n1960s - 1980s.\nBy the mid-20th century, frequency modulation (FM), a means of carrying sound, had been understood for decades and was being used to broadcast radio transmissions. FM synthesis was developed in the 1960s at Stanford University, California, by John Chowning, who was trying to create sounds different from analog synthesis. His algorithm was licensed to Japanese company Yamaha in 1973. The implementation commercialized by Yamaha (US Patent 4018121 Apr 1977 or U.S. Patent 4,018,121) is actually based on phase modulation, but the results end up being equivalent mathematically as both are essentially a special case of quadrature amplitude modulation.\nYamaha's engineers began adapting Chowning's algorithm for use in a commercial digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the \"key scaling\" method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during frequency modulation, though it would take several years before Yamaha released their FM digital synthesizers. In the 1970s, Yamaha were granted a number of patents, under the company's former name \"Nippon Gakki Seizo Kabushiki Kaisha\", evolving Chowning's work. Yamaha built the first prototype FM digital synthesizer in 1974. Yamaha eventually commercialized FM synthesis technology with the Yamaha GS-1, the first FM digital synthesizer, released in 1980.\nFM synthesis was the basis of some of the early generations of digital synthesizers, most notably those from Yamaha, as well as New England Digital Corporation under license from Yamaha. Yamaha's DX7 synthesizer, released in 1983, was ubiquitous throughout the 1980s. Several other models by Yamaha provided variations and evolutions of FM synthesis during that decade.\nYamaha had patented its hardware implementation of FM in the 1970s, allowing it to nearly monopolize the market for FM technology until the mid-1990s. Casio developed a related form of synthesis called phase distortion synthesis, used in its CZ range of synthesizers. It had a similar (but slightly differently derived) sound quality to the DX series. Don Buchla implemented FM on his instruments in the mid-1960s, prior to Yamaha's patent. His 158, 258 and 259 dual oscillator modules had a specific FM control voltage input, and the model 208 (Music Easel) had a modulation oscillator hard-wired to allow FM as well as AM of the primary oscillator. These early applications used analog oscillators, and this capability was also followed by other modular synthesizers and portable synthesizers including Minimoog and ARP Odyssey.\n1990s - present.\nWith the expiration of the Stanford University FM patent in 1995, digital FM synthesis can now be implemented freely by other manufacturers. The FM synthesis patent brought Stanford $20\u00a0million before it expired, making it (in 1994) \"the second most lucrative licensing agreement in Stanford's history\". FM today is mostly found in software-based synths such as FM8 by Native Instruments or Sytrus by Image-Line, but it has also been incorporated into the synthesis repertoire of some modern digital synthesizers, usually coexisting as an option alongside other methods of synthesis such as subtractive, sample-based synthesis, additive synthesis, and other techniques. The degree of complexity of the FM in such hardware synths may vary from simple 2-operator FM, to the highly flexible 6-operator engines of the Korg Kronos and Alesis Fusion, to creation of FM in extensively modular engines such as those in the latest synthesisers by Kurzweil Music Systems.\nNew hardware synths specifically marketed for their FM capabilities disappeared from the market after the release of the Yamaha SY99 and FS1R, and even those marketed their highly powerful FM abilities as counterparts to sample-based synthesis and formant synthesis respectively. However, well-developed FM synthesis options are a feature of Nord Lead synths manufactured by Clavia, the Alesis Fusion range, the Korg Oasys and Kronos and the Modor NF-1. Various other synthesizers offer limited FM abilities to supplement their main engines.\nIn 2016, Korg released the Korg Volca FM, a, 3-voice, 6 operators FM iteration of the Korg Volca series of compact, affordable desktop modules, and Yamaha released the Montage, which combines a 128-voice sample-based engine with a 128-voice FM engine. This iteration of FM is called FM-X, and features 8 operators; each operator has a choice of several basic wave forms, but each wave form has several parameters to adjust its spectrum. The Yamaha Montage was followed by the more affordable Yamaha MODX in 2018, with 64-voice, 8 operators FM-X architecture in addition to a 128-voice sample-based engine. Elektron in 2018 launched the Digitone, an 8-voice, 4 operators FM synth featuring Elektron's renowned sequence engine.\nFM-X synthesis was introduced with the Yamaha Montage synthesizers in 2016. FM-X uses 8 operators. Each FM-X operator has a set of multi-spectral wave forms to choose from, which means each FM-X operator can be equivalent to a stack of 3 or 4 DX7 FM operators. The list of selectable wave forms includes sine waves, the All1 and All2 wave forms, the Odd1 and Odd2 wave forms, and the Res1 and Res2 wave forms. The sine wave selection works the same as the DX7 wave forms. The All1 and All2 wave forms are a saw-tooth wave form. The Odd1 and Odd2 wave forms are pulse or square waves. These two types of wave forms can be used to model the basic harmonic peaks in the bottom of the harmonic spectrum of most instruments. The Res1 and Res2 wave forms move the spectral peak to a specific harmonic and can be used to model either triangular or rounded groups of harmonics further up in the spectrum of an instrument. Combining an All1 or Odd1 wave form with multiple Res1 (or Res2) wave forms (and adjusting their amplitudes) can model the harmonic spectrum of an instrument or sound. \nCombining sets of 8 FM operators with multi-spectral wave forms began in 1999 by Yamaha in the FS1R. The FS1R had 16 operators, 8 standard FM operators and 8 additional operators that used a noise source rather than an oscillator as its sound source. By adding in tuneable noise sources the FS1R could model the sounds produced in the human voice and in a wind instrument, along with making percussion instrument sounds. The FS1R also contained an additional wave form called the Formant wave form. Formants can be used to model resonating body instrument sounds like the cello, violin, acoustic guitar, bassoon, English horn, or human voice. Formants can even be found in the harmonic spectrum of several brass instruments.\nSpectral analysis.\nThe spectrum generated by FM synthesis with one modulator is expressed as follows:\nFor modulation signal formula_1, the carrier signal is\nIf we were to ignore the constant phase terms on the carrier formula_3 and the modulator formula_4, finally we would get the following expression, as seen on and :\nwhere formula_6 are angular frequencies (formula_7) of carrier and modulator, formula_8 is frequency modulation index, and amplitudes formula_9 is formula_10-th , respectively."}

{"id": "11574", "revid": "27229173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11574", "title": "Friedrich Bessel", "text": "Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (; 22 July 1784 \u2013 17 March 1846) was a German astronomer, mathematician, physicist and geodesist. He was the first astronomer who determined reliable values for the distance from the sun to another star by the method of parallax. A special type of mathematical functions were named Bessel functions after Bessel's death, though they had originally been discovered by Daniel Bernoulli and then generalised by Bessel.\nLife and family.\nBessel was born in Minden, Westphalia, then capital of the Prussian administrative region Minden-Ravensberg, as second son of a civil servant. He was born into a large family in Germany. At the age of 14 Bessel was apprenticed to the import-export concern Kulenkamp at Bremen. The business's reliance on cargo ships led him to turn his mathematical skills to problems in navigation. This in turn led to an interest in astronomy as a way of determining longitude.\nBessel came to the attention of a major figure of German astronomy at the time, Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, by producing a refinement on the orbital calculations for Halley's Comet in 1804, using old observation data taken from Thomas Harriot and Nathaniel Torporley in 1607.\nTwo years later Bessel left Kulenkamp and became Johann Hieronymus Schr\u00f6ter's assistant at Lilienthal Observatory near Bremen. There he worked on James Bradley's stellar observations to produce precise positions for some 3,222 stars.\nDespite lacking any higher education, especially at university, Bessel was appointed director of the newly founded K\u00f6nigsberg Observatory by King Frederick William III of Prussia in January 1810, at the age of 25. On the recommendation of fellow mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss (with whom he regularly corresponded) he was awarded an honorary doctor degree from the University of G\u00f6ttingen in March 1811.\nAround that time, the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence. However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are not known.\nIn 1842 Bessel took part in the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Manchester, accompanied by the geophysicist Georg Adolf Erman and the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.\nBessel married Johanna, the daughter of the chemist and pharmacist Karl Gottfried Hagen who was the uncle of the physician and biologist Hermann August Hagen and the hydraulic engineer Gotthilf Hagen, the latter also Bessel's student and assistant from 1816 to 1818. The physicist Franz Ernst Neumann, Bessel's close companion and colleague, was married to Johanna Hagen's sister Florentine. Neumann introduced Bessel's exacting methods of measurement and data reduction into his mathematico-physical seminar, which he co-directed with Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi at K\u00f6nigsberg. These exacting methods had a lasting impact upon the work of Neumann's students and upon the Prussian conception of precision in measurement.\nBessel had two sons and three daughters. His eldest daughter, Marie, married Georg Adolf Erman, member of the scholar family Erman. One of their sons was the renowned Egyptologist Adolf Erman.\nAfter several months of illness Bessel died in March 1846 at his observatory from retroperitoneal fibrosis.\nWork.\nWhile the observatory was still in construction Bessel elaborated the \"Fundamenta Astronomiae\" based on Bradley's observations. As a preliminary result he produced tables of atmospheric refraction that won him the Lalande Prize from the French Academy of Sciences in 1811. The K\u00f6nigsberg Observatory began operation in 1813.\nStarting in 1819, Bessel determined the position of over 50,000 stars using a meridian circle from Reichenbach, assisted by some of his qualified students. The most prominent of them was Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander.\nWith this work done, Bessel was able to achieve the feat for which he is best remembered today: he is credited with being the first to use the stellar parallax in calculating the distance to a star. Astronomers had believed for some time that parallax would provide the first accurate measurement of interstellar distances. In 1838 Bessel announced that 61 Cygni had a parallax of 0.314 arcseconds; which, given the diameter of the Earth's orbit, indicated that the star is 10.3 ly away. Given the current measurement of 11.4 ly, Bessel's figure had an error of 9.6%. Nearly at the same time Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve and Thomas Henderson measured the parallaxes of Vega and Alpha Centauri.\nAs well as helping determine the parallax of 61 Cygni, Bessel's precise measurements using a new meridian circle from Adolf Repsold allowed him to notice deviations in the motions of Sirius and Procyon, which he deduced must be caused by the gravitational attraction of unseen companions.\nHis announcement of Sirius's \"dark companion\" in 1844 was the first correct claim of a previously unobserved companion by positional measurement, and eventually led to the discovery of Sirius B.\nBessel was the first scientist who realized the effect later called \"personal equation\", that several simultaneously observing persons determine slightly different values, especially recording the transition time of stars.\nIn 1824, Bessel developed a new method for calculating the circumstances of eclipses using the so-called Besselian elements. His method simplified the calculation to such an extent, without sacrificing accuracy, that it is still in use today.\nBessel's work in 1840 contributed to the discovery of Neptune in 1846 at Berlin Observatory, several months after Bessel's death. On Bessel's proposal (1825) the Prussian Academy of Sciences started the edition of the \"Berliner Akademische Sternkarten\" (\"Berlin Academic Star Charts\") as an international project. One unpublished new chart enabled Johann Gottfried Galle to find Neptune near the position calculated by LeVerrier in 1846.\nIn the second decade of the 19th century while studying the dynamics of 'many-body' gravitational systems, Bessel developed what are now known as Bessel functions. Critical for the solution of certain differential equations, these functions are used throughout both classical and quantum physics.\nBessel is responsible for the correction to the formula for the sample variance estimator named in his honour. This is the use of the factor \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 in the denominator of the formula, rather than just \"n\". This occurs when the \"sample mean\" rather than the \"population mean\" is used to centre the data and since the sample mean is a linear combination of the data the residual to the sample mean overcounts the number of degrees of freedom by the number of constraint equations \u2014 in this case one. \"(Also see Bessel's correction)\".\nAn additional field of work was geodesy.\nBessel published a method for solving the main \ngeodesic problem.\nHe was responsible for the survey of East Prussia which joined the Prussian and Russian triangulation networks\nand he obtained an estimate of increased accuracy for the figure of the Earth, nowadays called the Bessel ellipsoid.\nBessel was elected a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1812 and of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1823, and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1825. In 1832, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1827 Bessel became member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, predecessor of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nBessel won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society twice, in 1829 and 1841.\nThe largest crater in the Moon's Mare Serenitatis and the main-belt asteroid 1552\u00a0Bessel, as well as two fjords in Greenland, Bessel Fjord, NE Greenland and Bessel Fjord, NW Greenland, were named in his honour."}

{"id": "11579", "revid": "14403972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11579", "title": "Fermi paradox", "text": "The Fermi paradox, named after Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial civilizations and various high estimates for their probability (such as some optimistic estimates for the Drake equation).\nThe following are some of the facts that together serve to highlight the apparent contradiction:\nThere have been many attempts to explain the Fermi paradox, primarily suggesting that intelligent extraterrestrial beings are extremely rare, that the lifetime of such civilizations is short, or that they exist but (for various reasons) we see no evidence.\nAlthough he was not the first to consider this question, Fermi's name is associated with the paradox because of a casual conversation in the summer of 1950 with fellow physicists Edward Teller, Herbert York and Emil Konopinski. While walking to lunch, the men discussed recent UFO reports and the possibility of faster-than-light travel. The conversation moved on to other topics, until during lunch Fermi allegedly said suddenly, \"But where is everybody?\" (although the exact quote is uncertain).\nHistory.\nFermi was not the first to ask the question. An earlier implicit mention was by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in an unpublished manuscript from 1933. He noted \"people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe\" because \"(i) if such beings exist they would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed then they would have given us some sign of their existence.\" This was not a paradox for others, who took this to imply the absence of ETs. But it was one for him, since he believed in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel. Therefore, he proposed what is now known as the zoo hypothesis and speculated that mankind is not yet ready for higher beings to contact us. That Tsiolkovsky himself may not have been the first to discover the paradox is suggested by his above-mentioned reference to other people's reasons for denying the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.\nIn 1975, Michael H. Hart published a detailed examination of the paradox, one of the first to do so. He argued that if intelligent extraterrestrials exist, and are capable of space travel, then the galaxy could have been colonized in a time much less than that of the age of the Earth. However, we see no evidence they have been here, which Hart called \"Fact A\".\nOther names closely related to Fermi's question (\"Where are they?\") include the Great Silence, and \"silentium universi\" (Latin for \"silence of the universe\"), though these only refer to one portion of the Fermi Paradox, that we see no evidence of other civilizations.\nOriginal conversation(s).\nIn the summer of 1950 at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, Fermi and co-workers Emil Konopinski, Edward Teller, and Herbert York had one or several casual lunchtime conversation(s).\nHerb York does not remember a previous conversation, although he says it makes sense given how all three later reacted to Fermi's outburst. Teller remembers seven or eight of them at the table, so he may well be remembering a different previous conversation.\nIn one version, the three men discussed a spate of recent UFO reports while walking to lunch. Konopinski remembered mentioning a magazine cartoon which showed aliens stealing New York City trash cans, and as he wrote years later, \"More amusing was Fermi's comment, that it was a very reasonable theory since it accounted for two separate phenomena.\"\nTeller remembered Fermi asking him, \"Edward, what do you think? How probable is it that within the next ten years we shall have clear evidence of a material object moving faster than light?\" Teller said, \"10\u20136\" (one in a million). Fermi said, \"This is much too low. The probability is more like ten percent\" (which Teller wrote in 1984 was \"the well known figure for a Fermi miracle\").\nAt lunch, Fermi suddenly exclaimed, \"Where are they?\" (Teller's remembrance), or \"Don't you ever wonder where everybody is?\" (York's remembrance), or \"But where is everybody?\" (Konopinski's remembrance).\nTeller wrote, \"The result of his question was general laughter because of the strange fact that in spite of Fermi's question coming from the clear blue, everybody around the table seemed to understand at once that he was talking about extraterrestrial life.\" York wrote, \"Somehow . . . we all knew he meant extra-terrestrials.\" However, Emil Konopinski was not emphatic that he immediately knew Fermi was referring to possible aliens, merely writing, \"It was his way of putting it that drew laughs from us.\"\nRegarding the continuation of the conversation, York wrote in 1984 that Fermi \"followed up with a series of calculations on the probability of earthlike planets, the probability of life given an earth, the probability of humans given life, the likely rise and duration of high technology, and so on. He concluded on the basis of such calculations that we ought to have been visited long ago and many times over.\"\nTeller remembers that not much came of this conversation \"except perhaps a statement that the distances to the next location of living beings may be very great and that, indeed, as far as our galaxy is concerned, we are living somewhere in the sticks, far removed from the metropolitan area of the galactic center.\"\nFermi died of cancer in 1954. However, in letters to the three surviving men decades later in 1984, Dr. Eric Jones of Los Alamos was able to partially put the original conversation back together. He informed each of the men that he wished to include a reasonably accurate version or composite in the written proceedings he was putting together for a previously-held conference entitled \"Interstellar Migration and the Human Experience.\"\nJones first sent a letter to Edward Teller which included a secondhand account from Hans Mark. Teller responded, and then Jones sent Teller's letter to Herbert York. York responded, and finally, Jones sent both Teller's and York's letters to Emil Konopinski who also responded. Furthermore, Konopinski was able to later identify a cartoon which Jones found as the one involved in the conversation and thereby help to settle the time period as being the summer of 1950.\nBasis.\nThe Fermi paradox is a conflict between the argument that scale and probability seem to favor intelligent life being common in the universe, and the total lack of evidence of intelligent life having ever arisen anywhere other than on the Earth.\nThe first aspect of the Fermi paradox is a function of the scale or the large numbers involved: there are an estimated 200\u2013400 billion stars in the Milky Way (2\u20134 \u00d7 1011) and 70 sextillion (7\u00d71022) in the observable universe. Even if intelligent life occurs on only a minuscule percentage of planets around these stars, there might still be a great number of extant civilizations, and if the percentage were high enough it would produce a significant number of extant civilizations in the Milky Way. This assumes the mediocrity principle, by which the Earth is a typical planet.\nThe second aspect of the Fermi paradox is the argument of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible that at least some civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe, of other intelligent life after 13.8\u00a0billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than we think, that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific understanding of the nature of the universe itself is quite incomplete.\nThe Fermi paradox can be asked in two ways. The first is, \"Why are no aliens or their artifacts found here on Earth, or in the Solar System?\" If interstellar travel is possible, even the \"slow\" kind nearly within the reach of Earth technology, then it would only take from 5 million to 50\u00a0million years to colonize the galaxy. This is relatively brief on a geological scale, let alone a cosmological one. Since there are many stars older than the Sun, and since intelligent life might have evolved earlier elsewhere, the question then becomes why the galaxy has not been colonized already. Even if colonization is impractical or undesirable to all alien civilizations, large-scale \"exploration\" of the galaxy could be possible by probes. These might leave detectable artifacts in the Solar System, such as old probes or evidence of mining activity, but none of these have been observed.\nThe second form of the question is \"Why do we see no signs of intelligence elsewhere in the universe?\" This version does not assume interstellar travel, but includes other galaxies as well. For distant galaxies, travel times may well explain the lack of alien visits to Earth, but a sufficiently advanced civilization could potentially be observable over a significant fraction of the size of the observable universe. Even if such civilizations are rare, the scale argument indicates they should exist somewhere at some point during the history of the universe, and since they could be detected from far away over a considerable period of time, many more potential sites for their origin are within range of our observation. It is unknown whether the paradox is stronger for our galaxy or for the universe as a whole.\nDrake equation.\nThe theories and principles in the Drake equation are closely related to the Fermi paradox. The equation was formulated by Frank Drake in 1961 in an attempt to find a systematic means to evaluate the numerous probabilities involved in the existence of alien life. The equation is presented as follows:\nformula_1\nWhere the variables represent: formula_2 is the number of technologically advanced civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy; formula_3 is the rate of formation of stars in the galaxy; formula_4 is the fraction of those stars with planetary systems; formula_5 is the number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for organic life; formula_6 is the fraction of those suitable planets whereon organic life actually appears; formula_7 is the fraction of inhabitable planets whereon \"intelligent\" life actually appears; formula_8is the fraction of civilizations that reach the technological level whereby detectable signals may be dispatched; and formula_9 is the length of time that those civilizations dispatch their signals. The fundamental problem is that the last four terms (formula_10) are completely unknown, rendering statistical estimates impossible.\nThe Drake equation has been used by both optimists and pessimists, with wildly differing results. The first scientific meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), which had 10 attendees including Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, speculated that the number of civilizations was roughly between 1,000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. Conversely, Frank Tipler and John D. Barrow used pessimistic numbers and speculated that the average number of civilizations in a galaxy is much less than one. Almost all arguments involving the Drake equation suffer from the overconfidence effect, a common error of probabilistic reasoning about low-probability events, by guessing specific numbers for likelihoods of events whose mechanism is not yet understood, such as the likelihood of abiogenesis on an Earth-like planet, with current likelihood estimates varying over many hundreds of orders of magnitude. An analysis that takes into account some of the uncertainty associated with this lack of understanding has been carried out by Anders Sandberg, Eric Drexler and Toby Ord, and suggests \"a substantial \"ex ante\" probability of there being no other intelligent life in our observable universe\".\nGreat Filter.\nThe Great Filter, in the context of the Fermi paradox, is whatever prevents \"dead matter\" from giving rise, in time, to expanding, lasting life according to the Kardashev scale. The most commonly agreed-upon low probability event is abiogenesis: a gradual process of increasing complexity of the first self-replicating molecules by a randomly occurring chemical process. Other proposed great filters are the emergence of eukaryotic cells or of meiosis or some of the steps involved in the evolution of a brain capable of complex logical deductions.\nAstrobiologists Dirk Schulze-Makuch and William Bains, reviewing the history of life on Earth, including convergent evolution, concluded that transitions such as oxygenic photosynthesis, the eukaryotic cell, multicellularity, and tool-using intelligence are likely to occur on any Earth-like planet given enough time. They argue that the Great Filter may be abiogenesis, the rise of technological human-level intelligence, or an inability to settle other worlds because of self-destruction or a lack of resources.\nEmpirical evidence.\nThere are two parts of the Fermi paradox that rely on empirical evidence\u2014that there are many potential habitable planets, and that we see no evidence of life. The first point, that many suitable planets exist, was an assumption in Fermi's time but is now supported by the discovery that exoplanets are common. Current models predict billions of habitable worlds in our galaxy.\nThe second part of the paradox, that we see no evidence of extraterrestrial life, is also an active field of scientific research. This includes both efforts to find any indication of life, and efforts specifically directed to finding intelligent life. These searches have been made since 1960, and several are ongoing.\nAlthough astronomers do not usually search for extraterrestrials, they have observed phenomena that they could not immediately explain without positing an intelligent civilization as the source. For example, pulsars, when first discovered in 1967, were called little green men (LGM) because of the precise repetition of their pulses. In all cases, explanations with no need for intelligent life have been found for such observations, but the possibility of discovery remains. Proposed examples include asteroid mining that would change the appearance of debris disks around stars, or spectral lines from nuclear waste disposal in stars.\nElectromagnetic emissions.\nRadio technology and the ability to construct a radio telescope are presumed to be a natural advance for technological species, theoretically creating effects that might be detected over interstellar distances. The careful searching for non-natural radio emissions from space may lead to the detection of alien civilizations. Sensitive alien observers of the Solar System, for example, would note unusually intense radio waves for a G2 star due to Earth's television and telecommunication broadcasts. In the absence of an apparent natural cause, alien observers might infer the existence of a terrestrial civilization. Such signals could be either \"accidental\" by-products of a civilization, or deliberate attempts to communicate, such as the Arecibo message. It is unclear whether \"leakage\", as opposed to a deliberate beacon, could be detected by an extraterrestrial civilization. The most sensitive radio telescopes on Earth, , would not be able to detect non-directional radio signals even at a fraction of a light-year, but other civilizations could theoretically have much better equipment.\nA number of astronomers and observatories have attempted and are attempting to detect such evidence, mostly through the SETI organization. Several decades of SETI analysis have not revealed any unusually bright or meaningfully repetitive radio emissions.\nDirect planetary observation.\nExoplanet detection and classification is a very active sub-discipline in astronomy, and the first possibly terrestrial planet discovered within a star's habitable zone was found in 2007. New refinements in exoplanet detection methods, and use of existing methods from space (such as the Kepler and TESS missions) are starting to detect and characterize Earth-size planets, and determine if they are within the habitable zones of their stars. Such observational refinements may allow us to better gauge how common potentially habitable worlds are.\nConjectures about interstellar probes.\nSelf-replicating probes could exhaustively explore a galaxy the size of the Milky Way in as little as a million years. If even a single civilization in the Milky Way attempted this, such probes could spread throughout the entire galaxy. Another speculation for contact with an alien probe\u2014one that would be trying to find human beings\u2014is an alien Bracewell probe. Such a hypothetical device would be an autonomous space probe whose purpose is to seek out and communicate with alien civilizations (as opposed to von Neumann probes, which are usually described as purely exploratory). These were proposed as an alternative to carrying a slow speed-of-light dialogue between vastly distant neighbors. Rather than contending with the long delays a radio dialogue would suffer, a probe housing an artificial intelligence would seek out an alien civilization to carry on a close-range communication with the discovered civilization. The findings of such a probe would still have to be transmitted to the home civilization at light speed, but an information-gathering dialogue could be conducted in real time.\nDirect exploration of the Solar System has yielded no evidence indicating a visit by aliens or their probes. Detailed exploration of areas of the Solar System where resources would be plentiful may yet produce evidence of alien exploration, though the entirety of the Solar System is vast and difficult to investigate. Attempts to signal, attract, or activate hypothetical Bracewell probes in Earth's vicinity have not succeeded.\nSearches for stellar-scale artifacts.\nIn 1959, Freeman Dyson observed that every developing human civilization constantly increases its energy consumption, and, he conjectured, a civilization might try to harness a large part of the energy produced by a star. He proposed that a Dyson sphere could be a possible means: a shell or cloud of objects enclosing a star to absorb and utilize as much radiant energy as possible. Such a feat of astroengineering would drastically alter the observed spectrum of the star involved, changing it at least partly from the normal emission lines of a natural stellar atmosphere to those of black-body radiation, probably with a peak in the infrared. Dyson speculated that advanced alien civilizations might be detected by examining the spectra of stars and searching for such an altered spectrum.\nThere have been some attempts to find evidence of the existence of Dyson spheres that would alter the spectra of their core stars. Direct observation of thousands of galaxies has shown no explicit evidence of artificial construction or modifications. In October 2015, there was some speculation that a dimming of light from star KIC 8462852, observed by the Kepler Space Telescope, could have been a result of Dyson sphere construction. However, in 2018, observations determined that the amount of dimming varied by the frequency of the light, pointing to dust, rather than an opaque object such as a Dyson sphere, as the culprit for causing the dimming.\nHypothetical explanations for the paradox.\nRarity of intelligent life.\nExtraterrestrial life is rare or non-existent.\nThose who think that intelligent extraterrestrial life is (nearly) impossible argue that the conditions needed for the evolution of life\u2014or at least the evolution of biological complexity\u2014are rare or even unique to Earth. Under this assumption, called the rare Earth hypothesis, a rejection of the mediocrity principle, complex multicellular life is regarded as exceedingly unusual.\nThe Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the evolution of biological complexity requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a galactic habitable zone, a star and planet(s) having the requisite conditions, such as enough of a continuous habitable zone, the advantage of a giant guardian like Jupiter and a large moon, conditions needed to ensure the planet has a magnetosphere and plate tectonics, the chemistry of the lithosphere, atmosphere, and oceans, the role of \"evolutionary pumps\" such as massive glaciation and rare bolide impacts. And perhaps most importantly, advanced life needs whatever it was that led to the transition of (some) prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, sexual reproduction and the Cambrian explosion.\nIn his book \"Wonderful Life\" (1989), Stephen Jay Gould suggested that if the \"tape of life\" were rewound to the time of the Cambrian explosion, and one or two tweaks made, human beings most probably never would have evolved. On the other hand, other thinkers such as Fontana, Buss, and Kauffman have written about the self-organizing properties of life.\nExtraterrestrial intelligence is rare or non-existent.\nIt is possible that even if complex life is common, intelligence (and consequently civilizations) is not. While there are remote sensing techniques that could perhaps detect life-bearing planets without relying on the signs of technology, none of them has any ability to tell if any detected life is intelligent. This is sometimes referred to as the \"algae vs. alumnae\" problem.\nCharles Lineweaver states that when considering any extreme trait in an animal, intermediate stages do not necessarily produce \"inevitable\" outcomes. For example, large brains are no more \"inevitable,\" or convergent, than are the long noses of animals such as aardvarks and elephants. Humans, apes, whales, dolphins, octopuses, and squids are among the small group of definite or probable intelligence here on Earth. And as he points out, \"dolphins have had ~20 million years to build a radio telescope and have not done so.\"\nPeriodic extinction by natural events.\nNew life might commonly die out due to runaway heating or cooling on their fledgling planets. On Earth, there have been numerous major extinction events that destroyed the majority of complex species alive at the time; the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs is the best known example. These are thought to have been caused by events such as impact from a large meteorite, massive volcanic eruptions, or astronomical events such as gamma-ray bursts. It may be the case that such extinction events are common throughout the universe and periodically destroy intelligent life, or at least its civilizations, before the species is able to develop the technology to communicate with other intelligent species.\nEvolutionary explanations.\nIntelligent alien species haven't developed advanced technologies.\nIt may be that while alien species with intelligence exist, they are primitive or have not reached the level of technological advancement necessary to communicate. Along with non-intelligent life, such civilizations would also be very difficult for us to detect, short of a visit by a probe, a trip that would take hundreds of thousands of years with current technology.\nTo skeptics, the fact that in the history of life on the Earth only one species has developed a civilization to the point of being capable of spaceflight and radio technology lends more credence to the idea that technologically advanced civilizations are rare in the universe.\nAnother hypothesis in this category is the \"Water World hypothesis\". According to David Brin: \"it turns out that our Earth skates the very inner edge of our sun\u2019s continuously habitable\u2014or 'Goldilocks'\u2014zone. And the Earth may be anomalous. It may be that because we are so close to our sun, we have an anomalously oxygen-rich atmosphere, and we have anomalously little ocean for a water world. In other words, 32 percent continental mass may be high among water worlds...\" Brin continues, \"In which case, the evolution of creatures like us, with hands and fire and all that sort of thing, may be rare in the galaxy. In which case, when we do build starships and head out there, perhaps we\u2019ll find lots and lots of life worlds, but they\u2019re all like Polynesia. We\u2019ll find lots and lots of intelligent lifeforms out there, but they\u2019re all dolphins, whales, squids, who could never build their own starships. What a perfect universe for us to be in, because nobody would be able to boss us around, and we\u2019d get to be the voyagers, the \"Star Trek\" people, the starship builders, the policemen, and so on.\"\nIt is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself.\nThis is the argument that technological civilizations may usually or invariably destroy themselves before or shortly after developing radio or spaceflight technology. The astrophysicist Sebastian von Hoerner stated that the progress of science and technology on Earth was driven by two factors\u2014the struggle for domination and the desire for an easy life. The former potentially leads to complete destruction, while the latter may lead to biological or mental degeneration. Possible means of annihilation via major global issues, where global interconnectedness actually makes humanity more vulnerable than resilient, are many, including war, accidental environmental contamination or damage, the development of biotechnology, synthetic life like mirror life, resource depletion, climate change, or poorly designed artificial intelligence. This general theme is explored both in fiction and in scientific hypothesizing. In 1966, Sagan and Shklovskii speculated that technological civilizations will either tend to destroy themselves within a century of developing interstellar communicative capability or master their self-destructive tendencies and survive for billion-year timescales. Self-annihilation may also be viewed in terms of thermodynamics: insofar as life is an ordered system that can sustain itself against the tendency to disorder, Stephen Hawking's \"external transmission\" or interstellar communicative phase, where knowledge production and knowledge management is more important than transmission of information via evolution, may be the point at which the system becomes unstable and self-destructs. Here, Hawking emphasizes self-design of the human genome (transhumanism) or enhancement via machines (e.g., brain-computer interface) to enhance human intelligence and reduce aggression, without which he implies human civilization may be too stupid collectively to survive an increasingly unstable system. For instance, the development of technologies during the \"external transmission\" phase, such as weaponization of artificial general intelligence or antimatter, may not be met by concomitant increases in human ability to manage its own inventions. Consequently, disorder increases in the system: global governance may become increasingly destabilized, worsening humanity's ability to manage the possible means of annihilation listed above, resulting in global societal collapse.\nUsing extinct civilizations such as Easter Island (Rapa Nui) as models, a study conducted in 2018 by Adam Frank \"et al.\" posited that climate change induced by \"energy intensive\" civilizations may prevent sustainability within such civilizations, thus explaining the paradoxical lack of evidence for intelligent extraterrestrial life. According to his model, possible outcomes of climate change include gradual population decline until an equilibrium is reached; a scenario where sustainability is attained and both population and surface temperature level off; and societal collapse, including scenarios where a tipping point is crossed.\nA less theoretical example might be the resource-depletion issue on Polynesian islands, of which Easter Island is only the most well-known. David Brin points out that during the expansion phase from 1500 BC to 800 AD there were cycles of overpopulation followed by what might be called periodic cullings of adult males through war and/or ritual. He writes, \"There are many stories of islands whose men were almost wiped out\u2014sometimes by internal strife, and sometimes by invading males from other islands.\"\nIt is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others.\nAnother hypothesis is that an intelligent species beyond a certain point of technological capability will destroy other intelligent species as they appear, perhaps by using self-replicating probes. Science fiction writer Fred Saberhagen has explored this idea in his \"Berserker\" series, as has physicist Gregory Benford.\nA species might undertake such extermination out of expansionist motives, greed, paranoia, or aggression. In 1981, cosmologist Edward Harrison argued that such behavior would be an act of prudence: an intelligent species that has overcome its own self-destructive tendencies might view any other species bent on galactic expansion as a threat. It has also been suggested that a successful alien species would be a superpredator, as are humans. Another possibility invokes the \"tragedy of the commons\" and the anthropic principle: the first lifeform to achieve interstellar travel will necessarily (even if unintentionally) prevent competitors from arising, and humans simply happen to be first.\nCivilizations only broadcast detectable signals for a brief period of time.\nIt may be that alien civilizations are detectable through their radio emissions for only a short time, reducing the likelihood of spotting them. The usual assumption is that civilizations outgrow radio through technological advancement. However, there could be other leakage such as that from microwaves used to transmit power from solar satellites to ground receivers.\nRegarding the first point, in a 2006 \"Sky &amp; Telescope\" article, Seth Shostak wrote, \"Moreover, radio leakage from a planet is only likely to get weaker as a civilization advances and its communications technology gets better. Earth itself is increasingly switching from broadcasts to leakage-free cables and fiber optics, and from primitive but obvious carrier-wave broadcasts to subtler, hard-to-recognize spread-spectrum transmissions.\"\nMore hypothetically, advanced alien civilizations may evolve beyond broadcasting at all in the electromagnetic spectrum and communicate by technologies not developed or used by mankind. Some scientists have hypothesized that advanced civilizations may send neutrino signals. If such signals exist, they could be detectable by neutrino detectors that are now under construction for other goals.\nAlien life may be too alien.\nAnother possibility is that human theoreticians have underestimated how much alien life might differ from that on Earth. Aliens may be psychologically unwilling to attempt to communicate with human beings. Perhaps human mathematics is parochial to Earth and not shared by other life, though others argue this can only apply to abstract math since the math associated with physics must be similar (in results, if not in methods).\nPhysiology might also cause a communication barrier. Carl Sagan speculated that an alien species might have a thought process orders of magnitude slower (or faster) than ours. A message broadcast by that species might well seem like random background noise to us, and therefore go undetected.\nAnother thought is that technological civilizations invariably experience a technological singularity and attain a post-biological character. Hypothetical civilizations of this sort may have advanced drastically enough to render communication impossible.\nIn his 2009 book, SETI scientist Seth Shostak wrote, \"Our experiments [such as plans to use drilling rigs on Mars] are still looking for the type of extraterrestrial that would have appealed to Percival Lowell [astronomer who believed he had observed canals on Mars].\"\nPaul Davies states that 500 years ago the very idea of a computer doing work merely by manipulating internal data may not have been viewed as a technology at all. He writes, \"Might there be a still \"higher\" level . . . If so, this 'third level' would never be manifest through observations made at the informational level, still less the matter level. There is no vocabulary to describe the third level, but that doesn't mean it is non-existent, and we need to be open to the possibility that alien technology may operate at the third level, or maybe the fourth, fifth . . . levels.\"\nSociological explanations.\nColonization is not the cosmic norm.\nIn response to Tipler's idea of self-replicating probes, Stephen Jay Gould wrote, \"I must confess that I simply don\u2019t know how to react to such arguments. I have enough trouble predicting the plans and reactions of the people closest to me. I am usually baffled by the thoughts and accomplishments of humans in different cultures. I\u2019ll be damned if I can state with certainty what some extraterrestrial source of intelligence might do.\"\nAlien species may have only settled part of the galaxy.\nA February 2019 article in \"Popular Science\" states, \"Sweeping across the Milky Way and establishing a unified galactic empire might be inevitable for a monolithic super-civilization, but most cultures are neither monolithic nor super\u2014at least if our experience is any guide.\"\nAstrophysicist Adam Frank, along with co-authors such as astronomer Jason Wright, ran a variety of simulations in which they varied such factors as settlement lifespans, fractions of suitable planets, and recharge times between launches. They found many of their simulations seemingly resulted in a \"third category\" in which the Milky Way remains partially settled indefinitely.\nThe abstract to their pending paper states, \"These results break the link between Hart's famous 'Fact A' (no interstellar visitors on Earth now) and the conclusion that humans must, therefore, be the only technological civilization in the galaxy.\"\nAlien species may not live on planets.\nSome colonization scenarios predict spherical expansion across star systems, with continued expansion coming from the systems just previously settled. It has been suggested that this would cause a strong selection process among the colonization front favoring cultural or biological adaptations to living in starships or space habitats. As a result, they may forgo living on planets.\nThis may result in the destruction of terrestrial planets in these systems for use as building materials, thus preventing the development of life on those worlds. Or, they may have an ethic of protection for \"nursery worlds\", and protect them in a similar fashion to the zoo hypothesis.\nAlien species may isolate themselves from the outside world.\nIt has been suggested that some advanced beings may divest themselves of physical form, create massive artificial virtual environments, transfer themselves into these environments through mind uploading, and exist totally within virtual worlds, ignoring the external physical universe.\nIt may also be that intelligent alien life develops an \"increasing disinterest\" in their outside world. Possibly any sufficiently advanced society will develop highly engaging media and entertainment well before the capacity for advanced space travel, with the rate of appeal of these social contrivances being destined, because of their inherent reduced complexity, to overtake any desire for complex, expensive endeavors such as space exploration and communication. Once any sufficiently advanced civilization becomes able to master its environment, and most of its physical needs are met through technology, various \"social and entertainment technologies\", including virtual reality, are postulated to become the primary drivers and motivations of that civilization.\nEconomic explanations.\nLack of resources needed to physically spread throughout the galaxy.\nMany speculations about the ability of an alien culture to colonize other star systems are based on the idea that interstellar travel is technologically feasible. While the current understanding of physics rules out the possibility of faster-than-light travel, it appears that there are no major theoretical barriers to the construction of \"slow\" interstellar ships, even though the engineering required is considerably beyond our present capabilities. This idea underlies the concept of the Von Neumann probe and the Bracewell probe as a potential evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.\nIt is possible, however, that present scientific knowledge cannot properly gauge the feasibility and costs of such interstellar colonization. Theoretical barriers may not yet be understood, and the resources needed may be so great as to make it unlikely that any civilization could afford to attempt it. Even if interstellar travel and colonization are possible, they may be difficult, leading to a colonization model based on percolation theory.\nColonization efforts may not occur as an unstoppable rush, but rather as an uneven tendency to \"percolate\" outwards, within an eventual slowing and termination of the effort given the enormous costs involved and the expectation that colonies will inevitably develop a culture and civilization of their own. Colonization may thus occur in \"clusters\", with large areas remaining uncolonized at any one time.\nIt is cheaper to transfer information than explore physically.\nIf a human-capability machine construct, such as via mind uploading, is possible, and if it is possible to transfer such constructs over vast distances and rebuild them on a remote machine, then it might not make strong economic sense to travel the galaxy by spaceflight. After the first civilization has physically explored or colonized the galaxy, as well as sent such machines for easy exploration, then any subsequent civilizations, after having contacted the first, may find it cheaper, faster, and easier to explore the galaxy through intelligent mind transfers to the machines built by the first civilization, which is cheaper than spaceflight by a factor of 108-1017. However, since a star system needs only one such remote machine, and the communication is most likely highly directed, transmitted at high-frequencies, and at a minimal power to be economical, such signals would be hard to detect from Earth.\nDiscovery of extraterrestrial life is too difficult.\nWe haven't listened properly.\nThere are some assumptions that underlie the SETI programs that may cause searchers to miss signals that are present. Extraterrestrials might, for example, transmit signals that have a very high or low data rate, or employ unconventional (in our terms) frequencies, which would make them hard to distinguish from background noise. Signals might be sent from non-main sequence star systems that we search with lower priority; current programs assume that most alien life will be orbiting Sun-like stars.\nThe greatest challenge is the sheer size of the radio search needed to look for signals (effectively spanning the entire observable universe), the limited amount of resources committed to SETI, and the sensitivity of modern instruments. SETI estimates, for instance, that with a radio telescope as sensitive as the Arecibo Observatory, Earth's television and radio broadcasts would only be detectable at distances up to 0.3 light-years, less than 1/10 the distance to the nearest star. A signal is much easier to detect if it consists of a deliberate, powerful transmission directed at us. Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds to tens of thousands of light-years distance. However, this means that detectors must be listening to an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent. Many SETI searches assume that extraterrestrial civilizations will be broadcasting a deliberate signal, like the Arecibo message, in order to be found.\nThus to detect alien civilizations through their radio emissions, Earth observers either need more sensitive instruments or must hope for fortunate circumstances: that the broadband radio emissions of alien radio technology are much stronger than our own; that one of SETI's programs is listening to the correct frequencies from the right regions of space; or that aliens are deliberately sending focused transmissions in our general direction.\nWe haven't listened for long enough.\nHumanity's ability to detect intelligent extraterrestrial life has existed for only a very brief period\u2014from 1937 onwards, if the invention of the radio telescope is taken as the dividing line\u2014and \"Homo sapiens\" is a geologically recent species. The whole period of modern human existence to date is a very brief period on a cosmological scale, and radio transmissions have only been propagated since 1895. Thus, it remains possible that human beings have neither existed long enough nor made themselves sufficiently detectable to be found by extraterrestrial intelligence.\nIntelligent life may be too far away.\nIt may be that non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, but that they are simply too far apart for meaningful two-way communication. Sebastian von Hoerner estimated the average duration of civilization at 6,500 years and the average distance between civilizations in the Milky Way at 1,000 light years. If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, it is possible that one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is possible that observational signatures of self-destroyed civilizations could be detected, depending on the destruction scenario and the timing of our observation relative to it.\nA related speculation by Sagan and Newman suggests that if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet. However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is a tiny fraction of the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions, so the likelihood that we are in the midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox.\nSome SETI skeptics may also believe that we are at a very special point of time. Specifically, that we are in a transitional period from no space-faring societies to one space-faring society, namely that of human beings.\nIntelligent life may exist hidden from view.\nPlanetary scientist Alan Stern put forward the idea that there could be a number of worlds with subsurface oceans (such as Jupiter's Europa or Saturn's Enceladus). The surface would provide a large degree of protection from such things as cometary impacts and nearby supernovae, as well as creating a situation in which a much broader range of orbits are acceptable. Life, and potentially intelligence and civilization, could evolve. Stern states, \"If they have technology, and let's say they're broadcasting, or they have city lights or whatever\u2014we can't see it in any part of the spectrum, except maybe very-low-frequency [radio].\"\nWillingness to communicate.\nEveryone is listening but no one is transmitting.\nAlien civilizations might be technically capable of contacting Earth, but are only listening instead of transmitting. If all, or even most, civilizations act the same way, the galaxy could be full of civilizations eager for contact, but everyone is listening and no one is transmitting. This is the so-called \"SETI Paradox\".\nThe only civilization we know, our own, does not explicitly transmit, except for a few small efforts. Even these efforts, and certainly any attempt to expand them, are controversial. It is not even clear we would respond to a detected signal\u2014the official policy within the SETI community is that \"[no] response to a signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence should be sent until appropriate international consultations have taken place.\" However, given the possible impact of any reply it may be very difficult to obtain any consensus on \"Who speaks for Earth?\" and \"What should we say?\"\nCommunication is dangerous.\nAn alien civilization might feel it is too dangerous to communicate, either for us or for them. It is argued that when very different civilizations have met on Earth, the results have often been disastrous for one side or the other, and the same may well apply to interstellar contact. Even contact at a safe distance could lead to infection by computer code or even ideas themselves. Perhaps prudent civilizations actively hide not only from Earth but from everyone, out of fear of other civilizations.\nPerhaps the Fermi paradox itself\u2014or the alien equivalent of it\u2014is the reason for any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely for them to be the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so.\nEarth is deliberately avoided.\nThe zoo hypothesis states that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists and does not contact life on Earth to allow for its natural evolution and development. A variation on the zoo hypothesis is the laboratory hypothesis, where humanity has been or is being subject to experiments, with the Earth or Solar System effectively serving as a laboratory. The zoo hypothesis may break down under the uniformity of motive flaw: all it takes is a single culture or civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within our range of detection for it to be abrogated, and the probability of such a violation of hegemony increases with the number of civilizations, tending not towards a 'Galactic Club' with a unified foreign policy with regard to life on Earth but multiple 'Galactic Cliques'.\nAnalysis of the inter-arrival times between civilizations in the galaxy based on common astrobiological assumptions suggests that the initial civilization would have a commanding lead over the later arrivals. As such, it may have established what we call the \"zoo hypothesis\" through force or as a galactic/universal norm and the resultant \"paradox\" by a cultural founder effect with or without the continued activity of the founder.\nIt is possible that a civilization advanced enough to travel between solar systems could be actively visiting or observing Earth while remaining undetected or unrecognized.\nEarth is deliberately isolated (planetarium hypothesis).\nA related idea to the zoo hypothesis is that, beyond a certain distance, the perceived universe is a simulated reality. The planetarium hypothesis speculates that beings may have created this simulation so that the universe appears to be empty of other life.\nAlien life is already here unacknowledged.\nA significant fraction of the population believes that at least some UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are spacecraft piloted by aliens. While most of these are unrecognized or mistaken interpretations of mundane phenomena, there are those that remain puzzling even after investigation. The consensus scientific view is that although they may be unexplained, they do not rise to the level of convincing evidence.\nSimilarly, it is theoretically possible that SETI groups are not reporting positive detections, or governments have been blocking signals or suppressing publication. This response might be attributed to security or economic interests from the potential use of advanced extraterrestrial technology. It has been suggested that the detection of an extraterrestrial radio signal or technology could well be the most highly secret information that exists. Claims that this has already happened are common in the popular press, but the scientists involved report the opposite experience\u2014the press becomes informed and interested in a potential detection even before a signal can be confirmed.\nRegarding the idea that aliens are in secret contact with governments, David Brin writes, \"Aversion to an idea, simply because of its long association with crackpots, gives crackpots altogether too much influence.\""}

{"id": "11582", "revid": "33080691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11582", "title": "Fundamentalism", "text": "Fundamentalism usually has a religious connotation that indicates unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs. However, fundamentalism has come to be applied to a tendency among certain groups \u2013 mainly, although not exclusively, in religion \u2013 that is characterized by a markedly strict literalism as it is applied to certain specific scriptures, dogmas, or ideologies, and a strong sense of the importance of maintaining ingroup and outgroup distinctions, leading to an emphasis on purity and the desire to return to a previous ideal from which advocates believe members have strayed. Rejection of diversity of opinion as applied to these established \"fundamentals\" and their accepted interpretation within the group often results from this tendency.\nDepending upon the context, the label \"fundamentalism\" can be a pejorative rather than a neutral characterization, similar to the ways that calling political perspectives \"right-wing\" or \"left-wing\" can have negative connotations.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhist fundamentalism has targeted other religious and ethnic groups, as in Myanmar. A Buddhist-dominated country, Myanmar has seen tensions between Muslim minorities and the Buddhist majority, especially during the 2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots (alleged to have been instigated by hardline groups such as the 969 Movement.) and in actions associated with the Rohingya genocide (2016 onwards).\nBuddhist fundamentalism also features in Sri Lanka. Buddhist-dominated Sri Lanka has seen recent tensions between Muslim minorities and the Buddhist majority, especially during the 2014 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka and in the course of the 2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka,\nallegedly instigated by hardline groups such as the Bodu Bala Sena. \nHistoric and contemporary examples of Buddhist fundamentalism occur in each of the three main branches of Buddhism: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. In Japan, a prominent example has been the practice among some members of the Mahayana Nichiren sect of shakubuku \u2014 a method of proselytizing involving strident condemnation of other sects as deficient or evil.\nChristianity.\nChristian fundamentalism has been defined by George Marsden as the demand for a strict adherence to certain theological doctrines, in reaction against Modernist theology. The term was originally coined by its supporters to describe what they claimed were five specific classic theological beliefs of Christianity, and that developed into a Christian fundamentalist movement within the Protestant community of the United States in the early part of the 20th century. Fundamentalism as a movement arose in the United States, starting among conservative Presbyterian theologians at Princeton Theological Seminary in the late 19th century. It soon spread to conservatives among the Baptists and other denominations around 1910 to 1920. The movement's purpose was to reaffirm key theological tenets and defend them against the challenges of liberal theology and higher criticism.\nThe concept of \"fundamentalism\" has roots in the Niagara Bible Conferences that were held annually between 1878 and 1897. During those conferences, the tenets considered \"fundamental\" to Christian belief were identified. \n\"Fundamentalism\" was prefigured by \"The Fundamentals: A Testimony To The Truth\", a collection of twelve pamphlets published between 1910 and 1915, by brothers Milton and Lyman Stewart. It is widely considered to be the foundation of modern Christian fundamentalism.\nIn 1910, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church identified what became known as the \"five fundamentals\":\nIn 1920, the word \"fundamentalist\" was first used in print by Curtis Lee Laws, editor of \"The Watchman Examiner,\" a Baptist newspaper. Laws proposed that those Christians who were fighting for the fundamentals of the faith should be called \"fundamentalists.\" \nTheological conservatives who rallied around the five fundamentals came to be known as \"fundamentalists\". They rejected the existence of commonalities with theologically related religious traditions, such as the grouping of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism into one Abrahamic family of religions. By contrast, while Evangelical groups (such as the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association) typically agree with the \"fundamentals\" as they are expressed in \"The Fundamentals\", they are often willing to participate in events with religious groups which do not hold to the essential doctrines.\nHinduism.\nScholars identify several politically active Hindu movements as part of the \"Hindu fundamentalist family.\"\nIslam.\nExtremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the time of the Kharijites. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to Takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.\nThe Shia and Sunni religious conflicts since the 7th century created an opening for radical ideologues, such as Ali Shariati (1933\u201377), to merge social revolution with Islamic fundamentalism, as exemplified by the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Islamic fundamentalism has appeared in many countries; the Wahhabi version is promoted worldwide and financed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Pakistan.\nThe Iran hostage crisis of 1979\u201380 marked a major turning point in the use of the term \"fundamentalism\". The media, in an attempt to explain the ideology of Ayatollah Khomeini and the Iranian Revolution to a Western audience described it as a \"fundamentalist version of Islam\" by way of analogy to the Christian fundamentalist movement in the U.S. Thus was born the term \"Islamic fundamentalist\", which became a common use of the term in following years.\nJudaism.\nJewish fundamentalism has been used to characterize militant religious Zionism, and both Ashkenazi and Sephardic versions of Haredi Judaism. Ian S Lustik has characterized Jewish fundamentalism as \"an ultranationalist, eschatologically based, irredentist ideology.\"\nNon-religious.\nPolitical usage of the term \"fundamentalism\" has been criticized. It has been used by political groups to berate opponents, using the term flexibly depending on their political interests. According to Judith Nagata, a professor of Asia Research Institute in the National University of Singapore, \"The Afghan \"mujahiddin\", locked in combat with the Soviet enemy in the 1980s, could be praised as 'freedom fighters' by their American backers at the time, while the present Taliban, viewed, among other things, as protectors of American enemy Osama bin Laden, are unequivocally 'fundamentalist'.\"\n\"Fundamentalist\" has been used pejoratively to refer to philosophies perceived as literal-minded or carrying a pretense of being the sole source of objective truth, regardless of whether it is usually called a religion. For instance, the Archbishop of Wales has criticized \"atheistic fundamentalism\" broadly and said \"Any kind of fundamentalism, be it Biblical, atheistic or Islamic, is dangerous\". He also said, \"the new fundamentalism of our age ... leads to the language of expulsion and exclusivity, of extremism and polarisation, and the claim that, because God is on our side, he is not on yours.\" He claimed it led to situations such as councils calling Christmas \"Winterval\", schools refusing to put on nativity plays and crosses being removed from chapels. Others have countered that some of these attacks on Christmas are urban legends, not all schools do nativity plays because they choose to perform other traditional plays like A Christmas Carol or The Snow Queen and, because of rising tensions between various religions, opening up public spaces to alternate displays rather than the Nativity scene is an attempt to keep government religion-neutral.\nIn \"The New Inquisition\", Robert Anton Wilson lampoons the members of skeptical organizations such as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal as fundamentalist materialists, alleging that they dogmatically dismiss any evidence that conflicts with materialism as hallucination or fraud.\nIn France, during a protestation march against the imposition of restrictions on the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools, a banner labeled the ban as \"secular fundamentalism\". In the United States, private or cultural intolerance of women wearing the hijab (Islamic headcovering) and political activism by Muslims also has been labeled \"secular fundamentalism\".\nThe term \"fundamentalism\" is sometimes applied to signify a counter-cultural fidelity to a principle or set of principles, as in the pejorative term \"market fundamentalism\", used to imply exaggerated religious-like faith in the ability of unfettered \"laissez-faire\" or free-market capitalist economic views or policies to solve economic and social problems. According to economist John Quiggin, the standard features of \"economic fundamentalist rhetoric\" are \"dogmatic\" assertions and the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist. Retired professor in religious studies Roderick Hindery lists positive qualities attributed to political, economic, or other forms of cultural fundamentalism, including \"vitality, enthusiasm, willingness to back up words with actions, and the avoidance of facile compromise\" as well as negative aspects such as psychological attitudes, occasionally elitist and pessimistic perspectives, and in some cases literalism.\nCriticism.\nA criticism by Elliot N. Dorff:\nIn order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be discerned from among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.\nHoward Thurman was interviewed in the late 1970s for a BBC feature on religion. He told the interviewer:\nInfluential criticisms of fundamentalism include James Barr's books on Christian fundamentalism and Bassam Tibi's analysis of Islamic fundamentalism.\nA study at the University of Edinburgh found that of its six measured dimensions of religiosity, \"lower intelligence is most associated with higher levels of fundamentalism.\"\nControversy.\nThe Associated Press' \"AP Stylebook\" recommends that the term fundamentalist not be used for any group that does not apply the term to itself. Many scholars have adopted a similar position. Other scholars, however, use the term in the broader descriptive sense to refer to various groups in various religious traditions including those groups that would object to being classified as fundamentalists, such as in the Fundamentalism Project.\nTex Sample asserts that it is a mistake to refer to a Muslim, Jewish, or Christian fundamentalist. Rather, a fundamentalist's fundamentalism is their primary concern, over and above other denominational or faith considerations."}
{"id": "11585", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11585", "title": "Show Me Love (film)", "text": "Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l (released in some countries as Show Me Love) is a 1998 Swedish romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Lukas Moodysson in his feature-length directorial debut. It stars Rebecka Liljeberg and Alexandra Dahlstr\u00f6m as two seemingly disparate teenage girls who begin a tentative romantic relationship. The film was released theatrically in Sweden on 23 October 1998, and first premiered internationally at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe film received an overwhelmingly positive reception and won four Guldbagge Awards (Sweden's official film awards) at the 1999 ceremony. Its international awards include the Teddy Award at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival, and the Special Jury Prize at the 34th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.\nThe Swedish title refers to the small town of \u00c5m\u00e5l in V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, western Sweden. However, only a few scenes were filmed in \u00c5m\u00e5l, and they were not included in the final version. The main shooting took place in the nearby town of Trollh\u00e4ttan, the location of producing company Film i V\u00e4st's studios.\nPlot.\nTwo girls, Agnes and Elin, attend school in the small town of \u00c5m\u00e5l, Sweden. Elin is outgoing and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it.\nAgnes's parents worry about their daughter's reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party.\nElin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.\nAfter becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from cutting herself. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in \u00c5m\u00e5l. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving \u00c5m\u00e5l and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car.\nElin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to 'out' their relationship to the school.\nThe film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying \"It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.\"\nTitle.\nThe original title of the film, \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\", refers to the girls' feelings about their small town: In a key scene Elin shouts in desperation \"varf\u00f6r m\u00e5ste vi bo i fucking j\u00e4vla kuk-\u00c5m\u00e5l?\" (which roughly translates to \"why do we have to live in fucking bloody cock-\u00c5m\u00e5l?\").\nAccording to Moodysson, the problem with the original title started when the film was Sweden's candidate for the Academy Awards, though eventually it was not chosen as a nominee. The Hollywood industry magazine \"Variety\" refused to run an advertisement for \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\". Thus, American distributor Strand Releasing asked for a new title. Moodysson took the new title from the song at the end of the film, by Robyn. Distributors in other native English-speaking countries then followed suit. \nReception.\nPolitical controversy.\nEven before the film was completed, it created controversy in the town of \u00c5m\u00e5l. Local politicians campaigned to get the title changed because they argued that it would show the town in an unfair way and even undermine it as an economic centre. Further pressure was brought on the makers of the film, the Film i V\u00e4st studio, who are partly financed by Swedish local authorities, including \u00c5m\u00e5l.\nHowever, the local complaints had no effect on the content or release of the film. Since the release, the town of \u00c5m\u00e5l has tried to embrace the publicity generated, despite the fact that the town's name is missing from the English title. In the early 2000s the town founded the pop music \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l Festival.\"\nCritical and commercial response.\n\"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\" received the highest audience figures for a Swedish film in 1998\u20139, with a total audience of 867,576 and a total audience for the whole of Europe of 2,100,000. Some reports outside Sweden stated that in Sweden the film had outgrossed the Hollywood film \"Titanic\". In fact, \"Titanic\" had over twice as many viewers as \"Show Me Love\" in Sweden in 1998. Based on 39 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of critics gave \"Show Me Love\" a positive review. It is among the top ten of the British Film Institute list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.\nThe film received consistently good reviews, including the realism and credibility of its portrayal of what it is like to be a teenager in a small town in the 1990s. In addition, the efforts of the young actors were praised. Jan-Olov Andersson at Aftonbladet felt that Dahlstr\u00f6m's and Liljeberg's imaginative appearance and interaction was \"sensationally credible\", and Bo Ludvigsson at Svenska Dagbladet wrote that it was \"a warm, strong and confident film about the courage to be human\". Ludvigsson also believed that \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\", with its storytelling drive, leave and authenticity, was well above most of the Swedish films of recent years. Anders Hansson at G\u00f6teborgs-Posten thought that director Moodysson with fairly ordinary elements created \"a film with unusual rise\".\nAutostraddle placed it at number one on its \"Top 10 Best Lesbian Movies\" list.\nCultural impact.\nAccording to Russian singer Lena Katina, producer Ivan Shapovalov was inspired to create the pop duo t.A.T.u. after the release of this film. The track \"Show Me Love\" is featured in their album \"200 km/h in the Wrong Lane\".\nSoundtrack.\nThe film's soundtrack was released through Metronome Records and consists of songs in English and Swedish language. Swedish band Broder Daniel, who contributed three English language songs to \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\", saw a spike in popularity after the film's release. The band also released an EP titled \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\".\nAwards and nominations.\n! rowspan=\"24\" | 1999\n! rowspan=\"3\" | 2000"}
{"id": "11586", "revid": "40188049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11586", "title": "Full disclosure (computer security)", "text": "In the field of computer security, independent researchers often discover flaws in software that can be abused to cause unintended behaviour; these flaws are called vulnerabilities. The process by which the analysis of these vulnerabilities is shared with third parties is the subject of much debate, and is referred to as the researcher's \"disclosure policy\". Full disclosure is the practice of publishing analysis of software vulnerabilities as early as possible, making the data accessible to everyone without restriction. The primary purpose of widely disseminating information about vulnerabilities is so that potential victims are as knowledgeable as those who attack them.\nIn his 2007 essay on the topic, Bruce Schneier stated \"Full disclosure \u2013 the practice of making the details of security vulnerabilities public \u2013 is a damned good idea. Public scrutiny is the only reliable way to improve security, while secrecy only makes us less secure\". Leonard Rose, co-creator of an electronic mailing list that has superseded bugtraq to become the de facto forum for disseminating advisories, explains \"We don't believe in security by obscurity, and as far as we know, full disclosure is the only way to ensure that everyone, not just the insiders, have access to the information we need.\"\nThe vulnerability disclosure debate.\nThe controversy around the public disclosure of sensitive information is not new. The issue of full disclosure was first raised in the context of locksmithing, in a 19th-century controversy regarding whether weaknesses in lock systems should be kept secret in the locksmithing community, or revealed to the public. Today, there are three major disclosure policies under which most others can be categorized: Non Disclosure, Coordinated Disclosure, and Full Disclosure.\nThe major stakeholders in vulnerability research have their disclosure policies shaped by various motivations, it is not uncommon to observe campaigning, marketing or lobbying for their preferred policy to be adopted and chastising those who dissent. Many prominent security researchers favor full disclosure, whereas most vendors prefer coordinated disclosure. Non disclosure is generally favored by commercial exploit vendors and blackhat hackers.\nCoordinated vulnerability disclosure.\nCoordinated vulnerability disclosure is a policy under which researchers agree to report vulnerabilities to a coordinating authority, which then reports it to the vendor, tracks fixes and mitigations, and coordinates the disclosure of information with stakeholders including the public. In some cases the coordinating authority is the vendor. The premise of coordinated disclosure is typically that nobody should be informed about a vulnerability until the software vendor says it is time. While there are often exceptions or variations of this policy, distribution must initially be limited and vendors are given privileged access to nonpublic research.\nThe original name for this approach was \u201cresponsible disclosure\u201d, based on the essay by Microsoft Security Manager Scott Culp \u201cIt's Time to End Information Anarchy\u201d (referring to full disclosure). Microsoft later called for the term to be phased out in favor of \u201cCoordinated Vulnerability Disclosure\u201d (CVD).\nAlthough the reasoning varies, many practitioners argue that end-users cannot benefit from access to vulnerability information without guidance or patches from the vendor, so the risks of sharing research with malicious actors is too great for too little benefit. As Microsoft explain, \"[Coordinated disclosure] serves everyone's best interests by ensuring that customers receive comprehensive, high-quality updates for security vulnerabilities but are not exposed to malicious attacks while the update is being developed.\"\nFull disclosure.\nFull disclosure is the policy of publishing information on vulnerabilities without restriction as early as possible, making the information accessible to the general public without restriction. In general, proponents of full disclosure believe that the benefits of freely available vulnerability research outweigh the risks, whereas opponents prefer to limit the distribution.\nThe free availability of vulnerability information allows users and administrators to understand and react to vulnerabilities in their systems, and allows customers to pressure vendors to fix vulnerabilities that vendors may otherwise feel no incentive to solve. There are some fundamental problems with coordinated disclosure that full disclosure can resolve.\nDiscovery of a specific flaw or vulnerability is not a mutually exclusive event, multiple researchers with differing motivations can and do discover the same flaws independently.\nThere is no standard way to make vulnerability information available to the public, researchers often use mailing lists dedicated to the topic, academic papers or industry conferences.\nNon disclosure.\nNon disclosure is the policy that vulnerability information should not be shared, or should only be shared under non-disclosure agreement (either contractually or informally).\nCommon proponents of non-disclosure include commercial exploit vendors, researchers who intend to exploit the flaws they find, and proponents of security through obscurity.\nDebate.\nArguments against coordinated disclosure.\nResearchers in favor of coordinated disclosure believe that users cannot make use of advanced knowledge of vulnerabilities without guidance from the vendor, and that the majority is best served by limiting distribution of vulnerability information. Advocates argue that low-skilled attackers can use this information to perform sophisticated attacks that would otherwise be beyond their ability, and the potential benefit does not outweigh the potential harm caused by malevolent actors. Only when the vendor has prepared guidance that even the most unsophisticated users can digest should the information be made public.\nThis argument presupposes that vulnerability discovery is a mutually exclusive event, that only one person can discover a vulnerability. There are many examples of vulnerabilities being discovered simultaneously, often being exploited in secrecy before discovery by other researchers. While there may exist users who cannot benefit from vulnerability information, full disclosure advocates believe this demonstrates a contempt for the intelligence of end users. While it's true that some users cannot benefit from vulnerability information, if they're concerned with the security of their networks they are in a position to hire an expert to assist them as you would hire a mechanic to help with a car.\nArguments against non disclosure.\nNon disclosure is typically used when a researcher intends to use knowledge of a vulnerability to attack computer systems operated by their enemies, or to trade knowledge of a vulnerability to a third party for profit, who will typically use it to attack their enemies.\nResearchers practicing non disclosure are generally not concerned with improving security or protecting networks. However, some proponents argue that they simply do not want to assist vendors, and claim no intent to harm others.\nWhile full and coordinated disclosure advocates declare similar goals and motivations, simply disagreeing on how best to achieve them, non disclosure is entirely incompatible."}

Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts and matriarchal religion.\nMethodology.\nDevelopment of feminist theology.\nWhile there is no specific date to pinpoint the beginning of this movement, its origins can be traced back to the 1960s article, \u201cThe Human Situation: A Feminine View,\u201d written by Valerie Saiving (Goldstein). Her piece of work questioned theologies written by men for men in a modern perspective to then dismantle what it had created over the years, patriarchal systems that oppress women. After Saiving's work was published, many scholars took up her ideas and elaborated upon them, which built the feminist theology movement further. Grenz and Olson view the steps of feminist theology in threes: first, feminist theologians critique the treatment of women in the past, second, they determine alternative biblical/religious texts that support feminist ideologies, and third, they claim the theology that adheres to such standards, through reclamation, abolishment, and/or revision. Grenz and Olson also mention that while all feminists agree there is a flaw in the system, there is disagreement over how far outside of the Bible and the Christian tradition women are willing to go to seek support for their ideals. This concept is also important when feminist theology is relating to other religions or spiritual connections outside of Chrisitanity.\nPrehistoric religion and archaeology.\nThe primacy of a monotheistic or near-monotheistic \"Great Goddess\" is advocated by some modern matriarchists as a female version of, preceding, or analogue to, the Abrahamic God associated with the historical rise of monotheism in the Mediterranean Axis Age.\nMother Nature (sometimes known as \"Mother Earth\") is a common representation of nature that focuses on the life-giving and nurturing features of nature by embodying it in the form of the mother. Images of women representing mother earth, and mother nature, are timeless. In prehistoric times, goddesses were worshipped for their association with fertility, fecundity, and agricultural bounty. Priestesses held dominion over aspects of Incan, Assyrian, Babylonian, Slavonic, Roman, Greek, Indian, and Iroquoian religions in the millennia prior to the inception of Patriarchal religion.\nGender and God.\nOthers who practice feminist spirituality may instead adhere to a feminist re-interpretation of Western monotheistic traditions. In those cases, the notion of God as having a male gender is rejected, and God is not referred to using male pronouns. Feminist spirituality may also object to images of God that they perceive as authoritarian, parental, or disciplinarian, instead emphasizing \"maternal\" attributes such as nurturing, acceptance, and creativity.\nCarol P. Christ is the author of the widely reprinted essay \"Why Women Need the Goddess\", which argues in favor of the concept of there having been an ancient religion of a supreme goddess. This essay was presented as the keynote address to an audience of over 500 at the \"Great Goddess Re-emerging\" conference at the University of Santa Cruz in the spring of 1978, and was first published in \"Heresies: The Great Goddess Issue\" (1978), pgs. 8-13. Carol P. Christ also co-edited the classic feminist religion anthologies \"Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality\" (1989) and \"Womanspirit Rising\" (1979/1989); the latter included her essay \"Why Women Need the Goddess\".\nNew Thought movement.\nNew Thought as a movement had no single origin, but was rather propelled along by a number of spiritual thinkers and philosophers and emerged through a variety of religious denominations and churches, particularly the Unity Church, Religious Science, and Church of Divine Science. It was a feminist movement in that most of its teachers and students were women; notable among the founders of the movement were Emma Curtis Hopkins, known as the \"teacher of teachers\" Myrtle Fillmore, Malinda Cramer, and Nona L. Brooks; with its churches and community centers mostly led by women, from the 1880s to today.\nWithin specific religions.\nJudaism.\nJewish feminism is a movement that seeks to make the religious, political, and social status of Jewish women equal to that of Jewish men. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major denominations of Judaism.\nThere are different approaches and versions of feminist theology that exist within the Jewish community.\nSome of these theologies promote the idea that it is important to have a feminine characterization of God within the siddur (Jewish prayerbook) and service. They challenge the male rabbi teachings that only emphasize God as a man with masculine traits only.\nIn 1976, Rita Gross published the article \"Female God Language in a Jewish Context\" (Davka Magazine 17), which Jewish scholar and feminist Judith Plaskow considers \"probably the first article to deal theoretically with the issue of female God-language in a Jewish context\". \u00a0Gross was Jewish herself at this time.\nReconstructionist Rabbi Rebecca Alpert (\"Reform Judaism\", Winter 1991) comments:\nIn 1990 Rabbi Margaret Wenig wrote the sermon, \"God Is a Woman and She Is Growing Older\", which as of 2011 has been published ten times (three times in German) and preached by rabbis from Australia to California.\nRabbi Paula Reimers (\"Feminism, Judaism, and God the Mother\", \"Conservative Judaism\" 46 (1993)) comments:\nAhuva Zache affirms that using both masculine and feminine language for God can be a positive thing, but reminds her Reform Jewish readership that God is beyond gender (\"Is God male, female, both or neither? How should we phrase our prayers in response to God\u2019s gender?\", in the Union for Reform Judaism's iTorah, ):\nThese views are highly controversial even within liberal Jewish movements. Orthodox Jews and many Conservative Jews\nhold that it is wrong to use English female pronouns for God, viewing such usage as an intrusion of modern, western feminist ideology into Jewish tradition. Liberal prayer books tend increasingly to also avoid male-specific words and pronouns, seeking that all references to God in translations be made in gender-neutral language. For example, the UK Liberal movement's \"Siddur Lev Chadash\" (1995) does so, as does the UK Reform Movement's \"Forms of Prayer\" (2008). In Mishkan T'filah, the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as \u201cHe\u201d have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.) In 2015 the Reform Jewish High Holy Days prayer book Mishkan HaNefesh was released; it is intended as a companion to Mishkan T'filah. It includes a version of the High Holy Days prayer Avinu Malkeinu that refers to God as both \"Loving Father\" and \"Compassionate Mother.\" Other notable changes are replacing a line from the Reform movement's earlier prayerbook, \"Gates of Repentance,\" that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line \"rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]\", and adding a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering \u201cmibeit,\u201d Hebrew for \u201cfrom the house of,\u201d in addition to the traditional \u201cson of\u201d or \u201cdaughter of.\u201d\nIn 2003 \"The Female Face of God in Auschwitz: A Jewish Feminist Theology of the Holocaust\", the first full-length feminist theology of the Holocaust, written by Melissa Raphael, was published. Judith Plaskow\u2019s \"Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective\" (1991), and Rachel Adler\u2019s \"Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics\" (1999) are the only two full-length Jewish feminist works to focus entirely on theology in general (rather than specific aspects such as Holocaust theology.) This work of feminist theology in regards to Judaism, also contextualizes the other goals of this movement, to re frame historical texts and how they are being taught. It is in addition to how God is being viewed but also the role of women historically and how they are being treated today in a new feminist light. \nWhile there is some opposition faced, Jewish communities believing feminism is too Western and does not validate Judaism, there is also the approval of an insider feminist perspective that takes into consideration traditions and modern thought.\nChristianity.\nChristian feminism is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Christian perspective. This is through reformation to be along the lines of feminist thought in regards to their religion. Christian feminists argue that contributions by women in that direction are necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity.\nThese theologians believe that God does not discriminate on the basis of biologically determined characteristics, such as sex and race. Their major issues include the ordination of women, male dominance in Christian marriage, recognition of equal spiritual and moral abilities, reproductive rights, and the search for a feminine or gender-transcendent divine. Christian feminists often draw on the teachings of more historical texts that reinforce that feminism does not go against Christianity but has always been in its texts.\nMary Daly grew up an Irish Catholic and all of her education was received through Catholic schools. She has three doctorate degrees, one from St. Mary's College in sacred theology then two from University of Fribourg, Switzerland in theology and philosophy. While in her early works Daly expressed a desire to reform Christianity from the inside, she would later come to the conclusion that Christianity is not able to enact the necessary changes as it is. According to Ford's The Modern Theologians, \u201cMary Daly has done more than anyone to clarify the problems women have concerning the central core symbolism of Christianity, and its effects on their self-understanding and their relationship to God.\u201d Daly is a prime example of how some feminist theologians come to the conclusion that reclamation and reform are no longer a viable option, that condemnation is the only way out.\nRosemary Radford Ruether writes about crucial additional interpretations of how Christian feminist theology is impacted by the world. Ruether grew up Roman Catholic and attended Catholic schools through her sophomore year of high school. She was a classics major at Scripps College, worked for the Delta Ministry in 1965 and taught at Howard University School of Religion from 1966 to 1976. \u201cRosemary Ruether has written on the question of Christian credibility, with particular attention to ecclesiology and its engagement with church-world conflicts; Jewish-Christian relations\u2026; politics and religion in America; and Feminism\". Ruether is said to be one of the major Christian feminist theologians of our time. Her book Sexism and God-Talk is the earliest feminist theological assessment of Christian theology.\nIn the 1970s Phyllis Trible pioneered a Christian feminist approach to biblical scholarship, using the approach of rhetorical criticism developed by her dissertation advisor, James Muilenburg.\nChristian feminist theology has consistently been critiqued as being focused on primarily white women. This has resulted in the development of movements such as womanist theology, focusing on African American women coined by the works of Alice Walker Asian feminist theology, and mujerista theology, introduced by Ada Maria Isasi-Dia concerning Latinas.\nThe term Christian egalitarianism is sometimes preferred by those advocating gender equality and equity among Christians who do not wish to associate themselves with the feminist movement.\nWomen apologists have become more visible in Christian academia. Their defense of the faith is differentiated by a more personal, cultural and listening approach \"driven by love\".\nSee also: Unity Church, Christian Science, Christian theological praxis and Postmodern Christianity.\nIslam.\nIslamic feminism is a form of feminism concerned with the role of women in Islam. It aims for the full equality of all Muslims, regardless of gender, in public and private life. Islamic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equality, and social justice grounded in an Islamic framework. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and European or non-Muslim feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement. Advocates of the movement seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Qur'an (holy book), \"hadith\" (sayings of Muhammad) and \"sharia\" (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society. This is done through the advocation of the female autonomy in line with the guideline of the Qur\u2019an. Feminist theologians like Azizah al-Hibri, professor of Law at University of Richmond, founded KARAMAH: Muslim Women Lawyers for Human Rights. Another form of claiming rights in power is that a few Muslim majority countries have produced more than seven female heads of state, including Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Mame Madior Boye of Senegal, Tansu \u00c7iller of Turkey, and Megawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia. Bangladesh was the first country in the world to have consecutive, elected, female heads of state: Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina.\nFeminist theology and Islam is also used to strengthen the spiritual connection to the women of Islam when they undergo severe trauma, to promote human rights especially those of women. Fatima Mernissi\u2019s book, \"The Forgotten Queens of Islam\", is a crucial piece in feminist theology for Islam and how it relates to a non western state.\nOther theologists include Riffat Hassan, Amina Wadud, and Asma Barlas. \nThis theology has been used to educate, re-frame religion, pose as a building block for peace, and the advancement of women\u2019s rights, in legislation and in society.\nSikhism.\nIn Sikhism women are equal to men. The verse from the Sikh scripture the Guru Granth Sahib states that:\nAccording to scholars such as Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh, feminist theology in Sikhism is also the feminization of rituals such as the ceremonial rite of who lights a funeral pyre. Singh further states that this is the reclamation of religion to inspire \u201cpersonal and social renewal of change\" and that these theologians are seen as gurus rather than simply women or scholars. The teachings of Guru Nanak focus on the singularity between men and women, with anything that differs denounced. He cites the example that origins and traditions stem from women as supervisors and in control, as well as engaged in history, such as Mai Bhago, who rallied men to fight against imperial forces alongside her in the battle at Muktsar in 1705.\nHinduism.\nWithin Ancient Hinduism, women have been held in equal honour as men. The Manusmriti for example states: \"The society that provides respect and dignity to women flourishes with nobility and prosperity. And a society that does not put women on such a high pedestal has to face miseries and failures regardless of how so much noble deeds they perform otherwise.\" Manusmrithi Chapter 3 Verse 56.\nWithin the Vedas the Hindu holy texts, women were given the highest possible respect and equality. The Vedic period was glorified by this tradition. Many rishis were women, indeed so that several of them authored many of the slokas, a poem, proverb or hymn, in the Vedas. For instance, in the Rigveda there is a list of women rishis. Some of them are: Ghosha, Godha, Gargi, Vishwawra, Apala, Upanishad, Brahmjaya, Aditi, Indrani, Sarma, Romsha, Maitreyi, Kathyayini, Urvashi, Lopamudra, Yami, Shashwati, Sri, Laksha and many others. In the Vedic period women were free to enter into brahmacharya just like men, and attain salvation.\nDuring Hindu marriage ceremonies, the following slokas are uttered by the grooms, yet in recent years their importance is understood less frequently with no actie desire to analyze them in depth to come to the conclusions that was being portrayed:\n\"O bride! I accept your hand to enhance our joint good fortune. I pray to you to accept me as your husband and live with me until our old age. ...\" \"Rigveda Samhita\" Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9702\n\"O bride! May you be like the empress of your mother-in-law, father-in-law, sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law (sisters and brothers of the groom). May your writ run in your house.\" \"Rigveda Samhita\" Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9712\nThis sloka from the Atharvaveda clearly states that the woman leads and the man follows: \"The Sun God follows the first illuminated and enlightened goddess Usha (dawn) in the same manner as men emulate and follow women.\" \"Athravaveda Samhita\", Part 2, Kanda 27, sukta 107, sloka 5705.\nWomen were considered to be the embodiment of great virtue and wisdom. Thus we have: \"O bride! May the knowledge of the Vedas be in front of you and behind you, in your center and in your ends. May you conduct your life after attaining the knowledge of the Vedas. May you be benevolent, the harbinger of good fortune and health and live in great dignity and indeed illuminate your husband's home.\" \"Atharva Veda\" 14-1-64. Women were allowed full freedom of worship. \"The wife should do agnihotra (yagna), sandhya (puja) and all other daily religious rituals. If, for some reason, her husband is not present, the woman alone has full rights to do yagna\". \"Rigveda Samhita\", part 1, sukta 79, sloka 872.\nMoving on towards the Monotheistic era of Hinduism when such ideals such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism, a specific deity for feministic worship was brought about under the Shaktism branch. From a Hinduism point of view women are equal in all measures to men in comparison, historical texts have stated this and is the basis of Hinduism, recognizing women as valuable and interconnected between men and women. Shakti, the name meaning power and referring to the female counterpart of Shiva, possesses connected powers that do not belong to just male or female but rather works together, equally dependent upon the other. Hindu feminist scholars also go beyond the reconstruction of texts but also the reestablishment of society and Hinduism in practice.\nNeopaganism.\nSome currents of Neopaganism, in particular Wicca, have a ditheistic concept of a single goddess and a single god, who in hieros gamos represent a united whole. Polytheistic reconstructionists focus on reconstructing polytheistic religions, including the various goddesses and figures associated with indigenous cultures.\nThe term \"thealogy\" is sometimes used in the context of the Neopagan Goddess movement, a pun on theology and \"thea\" \u03b8\u03b5\u03ac \"goddess\" intended to suggest a feminist approach to theism.\nThe Goddess movement is a loose grouping of social and religious phenomena that grew out of second-wave feminism, predominantly in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in the 1970s, and the metaphysical community as well. Spurred by the perception that women were not treated equitably in many religions, some women turned to a Female Deity as more in tune with their spiritual needs. Education in the Arts became a vehicle for the study of humanitarian philosophers like David Hume at that time. A unifying theme of this diverse movement is the femaleness of Deity (as opposed and contrasted to a patriarchal God).\nGoddess beliefs take many forms: some people in the Goddess movement recognize multiple goddesses, some also include gods, while others honour what they refer to as \"the Goddess,\" which is not necessarily seen as monotheistic, but is often understood to be an inclusive, encompassing term incorporating many goddesses in many different cultures. The term \"the Goddess\" may also be understood to include a multiplicity of ways to view deity personified as female, or as a metaphor, or as a process. (Christ 1997, 2003) The term \"The Goddess\" may also refer to the concept of The One Divine Power, or the traditionally worshiped \"Great Goddess\" of ancient times.\nIn the latter part of the 20th century, feminism was influential in the rise of Neopaganism in the United States, and particularly the Dianic tradition. Some feminists find the worship of a goddess, rather than a god, to be consonant with their views. Others are polytheists, and worship a number of goddesses. The collective set of beliefs associated with this is sometimes known as thealogy and sometimes referred to as the Goddess movement. See also Dianic Wicca.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhist feminism seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective and within Buddhism. While some core beliefs in Buddhism may cause friction with Western feminism, Buddhist feminist theology strives to find the common ground and balance between tradition and the goals of this movement. \nIn carrying the teachings of Buddhism, feminist theologians critique the common feminist ideology as \u201cother-ing\u201d males. This idea is in conflict with Buddhist beliefs of interconnections between all. The enemy is not the \u201cother\u201d but the idea that there is not a singular connection and being the same. \nBuddhist feminist theologies take into consideration religious ideologies, challenge Western feminist views, and reclaim what Buddhism is at its core, interconnected and accepting."}

{"id": "11592", "revid": "3174456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11592", "title": "Freeware", "text": "Freeware is software, most often proprietary, that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user. There is no agreed-upon set of rights, license, or EULA that defines \"freeware\" unambiguously; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers. For instance, modification, redistribution by third parties, and reverse engineering are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others. Unlike with free and open-source software, which are also often distributed free of charge, the source code for freeware is typically not made available. Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by, for example, encouraging sales of a more capable version, as in the freemium and shareware business models.\nHistory.\nThe term \"freeware\" was coined in 1982 by Andrew Fluegelman, who wanted to sell PC-Talk, the communications application he had created, outside of commercial distribution channels. Fluegelman distributed the program via a process now termed \"shareware\".\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the term \"freeware\" was often applied to software released without source code.\nDefinitions.\nSoftware license.\nSoftware classified as freeware may be used without payment and is typically either fully functional for an unlimited time or has limited functionality, with a more capable version available commercially or as shareware.\nIn contrast to what the Free Software Foundation calls free software, the author of freeware usually restricts the rights of the user to use, copy, distribute, modify, make derivative works, or reverse engineer the software. The software license may impose additional usage restrictions; for instance, the license may be \"free for private, non-commercial use\" only, or usage over a network, on a server, or in combination with certain other software packages may be prohibited. Restrictions may be required by license or enforced by the software itself; e.g., the package may fail to function over a network.\nRelation to other forms of software licensing.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) defines \"open source software\" (i.e., free software or free and open-source software), as distinct from \"freeware\" or \"shareware\"; it is software where \"the Government does not have access to the original source code\". The \"free\" in \"freeware\" refers to the price of the software, which is typically proprietary and distributed without source code. By contrast, the \"free\" in \"free software\" refers to freedoms granted users under the software license (for example, to run the program for any purpose, modify and redistribute the program to others), and such software may be sold at a price.\nAccording to the Free Software Foundation (FSF), \"freeware\" is a loosely defined category and it has no clear accepted definition, although FSF asks that free software (libre; unrestricted and with source code available) should not be called freeware.\nIn contrast the Oxford English Dictionary simply characterizes freeware as being \"available free of charge (sometimes with the suggestion that users should make a donation to the provider)\".\nSome freeware products are released alongside paid versions that either have more features or less restrictive licensing terms. This approach is known as freemium (\"free\" + \"premium\"), since the free version is intended as a promotion for the premium version. The two often share a code base, using a compiler flag to determine which is produced. For example, BBEdit has a BBEdit Lite edition which has fewer features. XnView is available free of charge for personal use but must be licensed for commercial use. The free version may be advertising supported, as was the case with the DivX.\nAd-supported software and free registerware also bear resemblances to freeware. Ad-supported software does not ask for payment for a license, but displays advertising to either compensate for development costs or as a means of income. Registerware forces the user to subscribe with the publisher before being able to use the product. While commercial products may require registration to ensure licensed use, free registerware do not.\nCreative Commons licenses.\nThe Creative Commons offer licenses, applicable to all by copyright governed works including software, which allow a developer to define \"freeware\" in a legal safe and internationally law domains respecting way. The typical freeware use case \"share\" can be further refined with Creative Commons restriction clauses like non-commerciality (CC BY-NC) or no-derivatives (CC BY-ND), see description of licenses. There are , for instance The White Chamber, Mari0 or Assault Cube, all freeware by being CC BY-NC-SA licensed: free sharing allowed, selling not.\nRestrictions.\nFreeware cannot economically rely on commercial promotion. In May 2015 advertising freeware on Google AdWords was restricted to \"authoritative source\"[s]. Thus web sites and blogs are the primary resource for information on which freeware is available, useful, and is not malware. However, there are also many computer magazines or newspapers that provide ratings for freeware and include compact discs or other storage media containing freeware. Freeware is also often bundled with other products such as digital cameras or scanners.\nFreeware has been criticized as \"unsustainable\" because it requires a single entity to be responsible for updating and enhancing the product, which is then given away without charge. Other freeware projects are simply released as one-off programs with no promise or expectation of further development. These may include source code, as does free software, so that users can make any required or desired changes themselves, but this code remains subject to the license of the compiled executable and does not constitute free software."}
{"id": "11593", "revid": "18010125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11593", "title": "Flat Earth", "text": "The flat Earth model is an archaic conception of Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period (323 BC), the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period (31 BC), India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD), and China until the 17th century.\nThe idea of a spherical Earth appeared in ancient Greek philosophy with Pythagoras (6th century BC), although most pre-Socratics (6th\u20135th century BC) retained the flat Earth model. In the early 4th century BC Plato wrote about a spherical Earth, and by about 330 BC his former student, Aristotle, had provided strong empirical evidence for this. Knowledge of the Earth's global shape then gradually began to spread beyond the Hellenistic world.\nDespite the scientific fact of Earth's sphericity, pseudoscientific flat Earth conspiracy theories are espoused by modern flat Earth societies and, increasingly, by unaffiliated individuals using social media.\nHistory.\nBelief in flat Earth.\nWest Asia.\nIn early Egyptian and Mesopotamian thought, the world was portrayed as a disk floating in the ocean. A similar model is found in the Homeric account from the 8th century BC in which \"Okeanos, the personified body of water surrounding the circular surface of the Earth, is the begetter of all life and possibly of all gods.\"\nThe Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts of ancient Egypt show a similar cosmography; Nun (the Ocean) encircled \"nbwt\" (\"dry lands\" or \"Islands\").\nThe Israelites also imagined the Earth to be a disc floating on water with an arched firmament above it that separated the Earth from the heavens. The sky was a solid dome with the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars embedded in it.\nGreece.\nPoets.\nBoth Homer and Hesiod described a disc cosmography on the Shield of Achilles.\nThis poetic tradition of an Earth-encircling (\"gaiaokhos\") sea (Oceanus) and a disc also appears in Stasinus of Cyprus, Mimnermus, Aeschylus, and Apollonius Rhodius.\nHomer's description of the disc cosmography on the shield of Achilles with the encircling ocean is repeated far later in Quintus Smyrnaeus' \"Posthomerica\" (4th century AD), which continues the narration of the Trojan War.\nPhilosophers.\nSeveral pre-Socratic philosophers believed that the world was flat: Thales (c. 550 BC) according to several sources, and Leucippus (c. 440 BC) and Democritus (c. 460\u2013370 BC) according to Aristotle.\nThales thought that the Earth floated in water like a log. It has been argued, however, that Thales actually believed in a round Earth. Anaximander (c. 550 BC) believed that the Earth was a short cylinder with a flat, circular top that remained stable because it was the same distance from all things. Anaximenes of Miletus believed that \"the Earth is flat and rides on air; in the same way the Sun and the Moon and the other heavenly bodies, which are all fiery, ride the air because of their flatness\". Xenophanes of Colophon (c. 500 BC) thought that the Earth was flat, with its upper side touching the air, and the lower side extending without limit.\nBelief in a flat Earth continued into the 5th century BC. Anaxagoras (c. 450 BC) agreed that the Earth was flat, and his pupil Archelaus believed that the flat Earth was depressed in the middle like a saucer, to allow for the fact that the Sun does not rise and set at the same time for everyone.\nHistorians.\nHecataeus of Miletus believed that the Earth was flat and surrounded by water. Herodotus in his \"Histories\" ridiculed the belief that water encircled the world, yet most classicists agree that he still believed Earth was flat because of his descriptions of literal \"ends\" or \"edges\" of the Earth.\nEurope.\nThe ancient Norse and Germanic peoples believed in a flat Earth cosmography with the Earth surrounded by an ocean, with the axis mundi, a world tree (Yggdrasil), or pillar (Irminsul) in the centre. In the world-encircling ocean sat a snake called Jormungandr. The Norse creation account preserved in Gylfaginning (VIII) states that during the creation of the Earth, an impassable sea was placed around it:\nThe late Norse Konungs skuggsj\u00e1, on the other hand, explains Earth's shape as a sphere:\nEast Asia.\nIn ancient China, the prevailing belief was that the Earth was flat and square, while the heavens were round, an assumption virtually unquestioned until the introduction of European astronomy in the 17th century. The English sinologist Cullen emphasizes the point that there was no concept of a round Earth in ancient Chinese astronomy:\nThe model of an egg was often used by Chinese astronomers such as Zhang Heng (78\u2013139 AD) to describe the heavens as spherical:\nThis analogy with a curved egg led some modern historians, notably Joseph Needham, to conjecture that Chinese astronomers were, after all, aware of the Earth's sphericity. The egg reference, however, was rather meant to clarify the relative position of the flat Earth to the heavens:\nFurther examples cited by Needham supposed to demonstrate dissenting voices from the ancient Chinese consensus actually refer without exception to the Earth being square, not to it being flat. Accordingly, the 13th-century scholar Li Ye, who argued that the movements of the round heaven would be hindered by a square Earth, did not advocate a spherical Earth, but rather that its edge should be rounded off so as to be circular. However, Needham disagrees, affirming that Li Ye believed the Earth to be spherical, similar in shape to the heavens but much smaller. This was preconceived by the 4th-century scholar Yu Xi, who argued for the infinity of outer space surrounding the Earth and that the latter could be either square or round, in accordance to the shape of the heavens. When Chinese geographers of the 17th century, influenced by European cartography and astronomy, showed the Earth as a sphere that could be circumnavigated by sailing around the globe, they did so with formulaic terminology previously used by Zhang Heng to describe the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon (i.e. that they were as round as a crossbow bullet).\nAs noted in the book \"Huainanzi\", in the 2nd century BC, Chinese astronomers effectively inverted Eratosthenes' calculation of the curvature of the Earth to calculate the height of the Sun above the Earth. By assuming the Earth was flat, they arrived at a distance of (approximately ). The \"Zhoubi Suanjing\" also discusses how to determine the distance of the Sun by measuring the length of noontime shadows at different latitudes, a method similar to Eratosthenes' measurement of the circumference of the Earth, but the \"Zhoubi Suanjing\" assumes that the Earth is flat.\nAlternate or mixed theories.\nGreece: spherical Earth.\nPythagoras in the 6th century BC and Parmenides in the 5th century stated that the Earth is spherical, and this view spread rapidly in the Greek world. Around 330 BC, Aristotle maintained on the basis of physical theory and observational evidence that the Earth was spherical, and reported an estimate of its circumference. The Earth's circumference was first determined around 240 BC by Eratosthenes. By the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy had derived his maps from a globe and developed the system of latitude, longitude, and climes. His \"Almagest\" was written in Greek and only translated into Latin in the 11th century from Arabic translations.\nLucretius (1st century BC) opposed the concept of a spherical Earth, because he considered that an infinite universe had no center towards which heavy bodies would tend. Thus, he thought the idea of animals walking around topsy-turvy under the Earth was absurd. By the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder was in a position to claim that everyone agreed on the spherical shape of Earth, though disputes continued regarding the nature of the antipodes, and how it is possible to keep the ocean in a curved shape.\nSouth Asia.\nThe Vedic texts depict the cosmos in many ways. One of the earliest Indian cosmological texts picture the Earth as one of a stack of flat disks.\nIn the Vedic texts, Dyaus (heaven) and Prithvi (Earth) are compared to wheels on an axle, yielding a flat model. They are also described as bowls or leather bags, yielding a concave model. According to Macdonell: \"the conception of the Earth being a disc surrounded by an ocean does not appear in the Samhitas. But it was naturally regarded as circular, being compared with a wheel (10.89) and expressly called circular (parimandala) in the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\".\"\nBy about the 5th century CE, the \"siddhanta\" astronomy texts of South Asia, particularly of Aryabhata, assume a spherical Earth as they develop mathematical methods for quantitative astronomy for calendar and time keeping.\nThe medieval Indian texts called the Puranas describe the Earth as a flat-bottomed, circular disk with concentric oceans and continents. This general scheme is present not only in the Hindu cosmologies, but also in Buddhist and Jain cosmologies of South Asia. However, some Puranas include other models. For example, the fifth canto of the \"Bhagavata Purana\", includes sections that describe the Earth both as flat and spherical.\nEarly Christian Church.\nDuring the early period of the Christian Church, the spherical view continued to be widely held, with some notable exceptions.\nAthenagoras, an eastern Christian writing around the year 175 CE, said that the Earth was spherical. Methodius (c.\u00a0290 AD), an eastern Christian writing against \"the theory of the Chaldeans and the Egyptians\" said: \"Let us first lay bare ... the theory of the Chaldeans and the Egyptians. They say that the circumference of the universe is likened to the turnings of a well-rounded globe, the Earth being a central point. They say that since its outline is spherical, ... the Earth should be the center of the universe, around which the heaven is whirling.\" Lactantius, a western Christian writer and advisor to the first Christian Roman Emperor, Constantine, writing sometime between 304\u2013313 CE, ridiculed the notion of \"antipodes\" and the philosophers who fancied that \"the universe is round like a ball. They also thought that heaven revolves in accordance with the motion of the heavenly bodies. ... For that reason, they constructed brass globes, as though after the figure of the universe.\" Arnobius, another eastern Christian writing sometime around 305 CE, described the round Earth: \"In the first place, indeed, the world itself is neither right nor left. It has neither upper nor lower regions, nor front nor back. For whatever is round and bounded on every side by the circumference of a solid sphere, has no beginning or end ...\"\nThe influential theologian and philosopher Saint Augustine, one of the four Great Church Fathers of the Western Church, similarly objected to the \"fable\" of antipodes:\nSome historians do not view Augustine's scriptural commentaries as endorsing any particular cosmological model, but while the view that Augustine shared the common view of his contemporaries that the Earth is spherical, in line with his endorsement of science in \"De Genesi ad litteram\", is still occasionally challenged, most scholars agree that \"Augustine\u2019s acceptance of the earth\u2019s spherical shape [is] a well-established fact\".\nDiodorus of Tarsus, a leading figure in the School of Antioch and mentor of John Chrysostom, may have argued for a flat Earth; however, Diodorus' opinion on the matter is known only from a later criticism. Chrysostom, one of the four Great Church Fathers of the Eastern Church and Archbishop of Constantinople, explicitly espoused the idea, based on scripture, that the Earth floats miraculously on the water beneath the firmament. Athanasius the Great, Church Father and Patriarch of Alexandria, expressed a similar view in \"Against the Heathen\".\n\"Christian Topography\" (547) by the Alexandrian monk Cosmas Indicopleustes, who had traveled as far as Sri Lanka and the source of the Blue Nile, is now widely considered the most valuable geographical document of the early medieval age, although it received relatively little attention from contemporaries. In it, the author repeatedly expounds the doctrine that the universe consists of only two places, the Earth below the firmament and heaven above it. Carefully drawing on arguments from scripture, he describes the Earth as a rectangle, 400 days' journey long by 200 wide, surrounded by four oceans and enclosed by four massive walls which support the firmament. The spherical Earth theory is contemptuously dismissed as \"pagan\".\nSeverian, Bishop of Gabala (d. 408), wrote that the Earth is flat and the Sun does not pass under it in the night, but \"travels through the northern parts as if hidden by a wall\". Basil of Caesarea (329\u2013379) argued that the matter was theologically irrelevant.\nEurope: Early Middle Ages.\nEarly medieval Christian writers in the early Middle Ages felt little urge to assume flatness of the Earth, though they had fuzzy impressions of the writings of Ptolemy and Aristotle, relying more on Pliny.\nWith the end of the Western Roman Empire, Western Europe entered the Middle Ages with great difficulties that affected the continent's intellectual production. Most scientific treatises of classical antiquity (in Greek) were unavailable, leaving only simplified summaries and compilations. In contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire did not fall, and it preserved the learning. Still, many textbooks of the Early Middle Ages supported the sphericity of the Earth in the western part of Europe.\nEurope's view of the shape of the Earth in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages may be best expressed by the writings of early Christian scholars:\nBishop Isidore of Seville (560\u2013636) taught in his widely read encyclopedia, the \"Etymologies\", diverse views such as that the Earth \"resembles a wheel\" resembling Anaximander in language and the map that he provided. This was widely interpreted as referring to a disc-shaped Earth. An illustration from Isidore's \"De Natura Rerum\" shows the five zones of the Earth as adjacent circles. Some have concluded that he thought the Arctic and Antarctic zones were adjacent to each other. He did not admit the possibility of antipodes, which he took to mean people dwelling on the opposite side of the Earth, considering them legendary and noting that there was no evidence for their existence. Isidore's T and O map, which was seen as representing a small part of a spherical Earth, continued to be used by authors through the Middle Ages, e.g. the 9th-century bishop Rabanus Maurus, who compared the habitable part of the northern hemisphere (Aristotle's northern temperate clime) with a wheel. At the same time, Isidore's works also gave the views of sphericity, for example, in chapter\u00a028 of \"De Natura Rerum\", Isidore claims that the Sun orbits the Earth and illuminates the other side when it is night on this side. See French translation of \"De Natura Rerum\". In his other work \"Etymologies\", there are also affirmations that the sphere of the sky has Earth in its center and the sky being equally distant on all sides. Other researchers have argued these points as well. \"The work remained unsurpassed until the thirteenth century and was regarded as the summit of all knowledge. It became an essential part of European medieval culture. Soon after the invention of typography it appeared many times in print.\" However, \"The Scholastics\u00a0\u2013 later medieval philosophers, theologians, and scientists\u00a0\u2013 were helped by the Arabic translators and commentaries, but they hardly needed to struggle against a flat-Earth legacy from the early middle ages (500\u20131050). Early medieval writers often had fuzzy and imprecise impressions of both Ptolemy and Aristotle and relied more on Pliny, but they felt (with one exception), little urge to assume flatness.\"\nSt Vergilius of Salzburg (c. 700\u2013784), in the middle of the 8th century, discussed or taught some geographical or cosmographical ideas that St Boniface found sufficiently objectionable that he complained about them to Pope Zachary. The only surviving record of the incident is contained in Zachary's reply, dated 748, where he wrote:\nSome authorities have suggested that the sphericity of the Earth was among the aspects of Vergilius's teachings that Boniface and Zachary considered objectionable. Others have considered this unlikely, and take the wording of Zachary's response to indicate at most an objection to belief in the existence of humans living in the antipodes. In any case, there is no record of any further action having been taken against Vergilius. He was later appointed bishop of Salzburg and was canonised in the 13th century.\nA possible non-literary but graphic indication that people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth (or perhaps the world) was a sphere is the use of the \"orb\" (globus cruciger) in the regalia of many kingdoms and of the Holy Roman Empire. It is attested from the time of the Christian late-Roman emperor Theodosius II (423) throughout the Middle Ages; the \"Reichsapfel\" was used in 1191 at the coronation of emperor Henry VI. However the word means \"circle\", and there is no record of a globe as a representation of the Earth since ancient times in the west until that of Martin Behaim in 1492. Additionally it could well be a representation of the entire \"world\" or cosmos.\nA recent study of medieval concepts of the sphericity of the Earth noted that \"since the eighth century, no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth\". However, the work of these intellectuals may not have had significant influence on public opinion, and it is difficult to tell what the wider population may have thought of the shape of the Earth, if they considered the question at all.\nEurope: Late Middle Ages.\nHermannus Contractus (1013\u20131054) was among the earliest Christian scholars to estimate the circumference of Earth with Eratosthenes' method. St. Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274), the most widely taught theologian of the Middle Ages, believed in a spherical Earth; and he even took for granted his readers also knew the Earth is round. Lectures in the medieval universities commonly advanced evidence in favor of the idea that the Earth was a sphere.\nTattersall shows that in many vernacular works in 12th- and 13th-century French texts the Earth was considered \"round like a table\" rather than \"round like an apple\". \"In virtually all the examples quoted ... from epics and from non-'historical' romances (that is, works of a less learned character) the actual form of words used suggests strongly a circle rather than a sphere\", though he notes that even in these works the language is ambiguous.\nPortuguese navigation down and around the coast of Africa in the latter half of the 1400s gave wide-scale observational evidence for Earth's sphericity. In these explorations, the Sun position moved more northward the further south the explorers travelled. Its position directly overhead at noon gave evidence for crossing the equator. These apparent solar motions in detail were more consistent with north\u2013south curvature and a distant Sun, than with any flat-Earth explanation. The ultimate demonstration came when Ferdinand Magellan's expedition completed the first global circumnavigation in 1521. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the few survivors of the voyage, recorded the loss of a day in the course of the voyage, giving evidence for east\u2013west curvature.\nMiddle East: Islamic scholars.\nThe Abbasid Caliphate saw a great flowering of astronomy and mathematics in the 9th century AD. Muslim scholars of the past believed in a spherical Earth.\nThe Quran mentions that the Earth (\"al-ar\u1e0d\") was \"spread out\". To this 12th-century commentary, the Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi) by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi states: \"If it is said: Do the words 'And the Earth We spread out' indicate that it is flat? We would respond: Yes, because the Earth, even though it is round, is an enormous sphere, and each little part of this enormous sphere, when it is looked at, appears to be flat. As that is the case, this will dispel what they mentioned of confusion. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 'And the mountains as pegs' [an-Naba' 78:7]. He called them \"awtaad\" (pegs) even though these mountains may have large flat surfaces. And the same is true in this case.\"\nThe 11th-century scholar Ibn Hazm stated: \"Evidence shows that the Earth is a sphere but public people say the opposite.\" He added: \"None of those who deserve being Imams for Muslims has denied that Earth is round. And we have not received anything indicates a denial, not even a single word.\"\nThe 13th-century scholar Ibn Taymiyyah stated that the Earth is spherical and not flat. He stated that the Arabic word \"falak\" () refers to that which is round. Ibn Abbas said that it is like that of a spinning wheel. The word is used in and . Unlike the previous scholars, scholar Al-Suyuti stated that the Earth is flat.\nMing Dynasty in China.\nA spherical terrestrial globe was introduced to Yuan-era Khanbaliq (i.e. Beijing) in 1267 by the Persian astronomer Jamal ad-Din, but it is not known to have made an impact on the traditional Chinese conception of the shape of the Earth. As late as 1595, an early Jesuit missionary to China, Matteo Ricci, recorded that the Ming-dynasty Chinese say: \"The Earth is flat and square, and the sky is a round canopy; they did not succeed in conceiving the possibility of the antipodes.\" The universal belief in a flat Earth is confirmed by a contemporary Chinese encyclopedia from 1609 illustrating a flat Earth extending over the horizontal diametral plane of a spherical heaven.\nIn the 17th century, the idea of a spherical Earth spread in China due to the influence of the Jesuits, who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court. Matteo Ricci, in collaboration with Chinese cartographers and translator Li Zhizao, published the \"Kunyu Wanguo Quantu\" in 1602, the first Chinese world map based on European discoveries. The astronomical and geographical treatise \"Gezhicao\" () written in 1648 by Xiong Mingyu () explained that the Earth was spherical, not flat or square, and could be circumnavigated.\nMyth of flat-Earth prevalence.\nBeginning in the 19th century, a historical myth arose which held that the predominant cosmological doctrine during the Middle Ages was that the Earth was flat. An early proponent of this myth was the American writer Washington Irving, who maintained that Christopher Columbus had to overcome the opposition of churchmen to gain sponsorship for his voyage of exploration. Later significant advocates of this view were John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White, who used it as a major element in their advocacy of the thesis that there was a long-lasting and essential conflict between science and religion. Some studies of the historical connections between science and religion have demonstrated that theories of their mutual antagonism ignore examples of their mutual support.\nSubsequent studies of medieval science have shown that most scholars in the Middle Ages, including those read by Christopher Columbus, maintained that the Earth was spherical.\nModern flat-Earthers.\nIn the modern era, the pseudoscientific belief in a flat Earth has been expressed by a variety of individuals and groups:\nFlat Earth Society.\nThe \"International Flat Earth Research Society\" (IFERS), better known as the Flat Earth Society, was set up by Samuel Shenton in 1956, in Dover, UK, as a direct descendant of the Universal Zetetic Society. This was just before the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik; he responded: \"Would sailing round the Isle of Wight prove that it were spherical? It is just the same for those satellites.\"\nHis primary aim was to reach children before they were convinced about a spherical Earth. Despite plenty of publicity, the space race eroded Shenton's support in Britain until 1967, when he started to become famous due to the Apollo program.\nIn 1972, Shenton's role was taken over by Charles K. Johnson, a correspondent from California, US. He incorporated the IFERS and steadily built it up to about 3000 members. He spent years examining the studies of flat- and round-Earth theories and proposed evidence of a conspiracy against flat Earth: \"The idea of a spinning globe is only a conspiracy of error that Moses, Columbus, and FDR all fought...\" His article was published in the magazine \"Science Digest\" in 1980. It goes on to state: \"If it is a sphere, the surface of a large body of water must be curved. The Johnsons have checked the surfaces of Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea without detecting any curvature.\"\nThe Society declined in the 1990s following a fire at its headquarters in California, and Johnson died in 2001. It was revived as a website in 2004 by Daniel Shenton (no relation to Samuel Shenton). He believes that no one has provided proof that the world is not flat.\nInternet-era resurgence.\nIn the Internet era, the proliferation of communications technology and social-media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have given individuals, famous or otherwise, a platform to spread pseudo-scientific ideas and build stronger followings. The flat-Earth conjecture has flourished in this environment. Social media and the internet, furthermore, have made it easier for like-minded theorists to connect with one another and mutually reinforce their beliefs. In other words, social media has had a \"levelling effect\", in that experts have less sway in the public mind than they used to.\nYouTube had faced criticism for allowing the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories through its platform. In 2019, YouTube stated that it was making changes in its software to reduce the distribution of videos based on conspiracy theories including flat Earth. \nOrganizations skeptical of fringe beliefs have occasionally performed tests to demonstrate the local curvature of the Earth. One of these, conducted by members of the Independent Investigations Group at the Salton Sea on June 10, 2018, was attended also by supporters of a flat Earth, and the encounter between the two groups was recorded by the National Geographic Explorer. This experiment successfully demonstrated the curvature of the Earth by the disappearance over distance of boat-based and shore-based targets.\nConspiracy theory.\nMembers of the Flat Earth Society and other flat-Earthers claim that NASA and other government agencies conspire to delude the public into believing the Earth is spherical. According to the most widely spread version of current flat-Earth theory, NASA is guarding the Antarctic ice wall that surrounds Earth. Flat-Earthers argue that NASA photoshops its satellite images, based on observations that the color of the oceans changes from image to image and that continents seem to be in different places. The publicly perpetuated image is kept up through a large-scale practice of \"compartmentalization\", according to which only a select number of individuals have knowledge about the truth.\nCultural references.\nThe term \"flat-earth-man\", used in a derogatory sense to mean anyone who holds ridiculously antiquated or impossible views, predates the more compact \"flat-earther\". It was recorded in 1908: \"Fewer votes than one would have thought possible for any human candidate, were he even a flat-earth-man.\" According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" \"flat-Earther's\" first use is in 1934 in \"Punch\" magazine: \"Without being a bigoted flat-earther, [Mercator] perceived the nuisance ... of fiddling about with globes ... in order to discover the South Seas.\""}

{"id": "11600", "revid": "14967932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11600", "title": "Persian language", "text": "Persian (), also known by its endonym Farsi (, \"\", ), is a Western Iranian language belonging to the Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian subdivision of the Indo-European languages. Persian is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties, namely Iranian Persian, Dari Persian (officially named \"Dari\" since 1958) and Tajiki Persian (officially named \"Tajik\" since the Soviet era). It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan, as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran. It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet, a derivation of the Arabic script, and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet, a derivation of Cyrillic.\nModern Persian is a continuation of Middle Persian, an official language of the Sasanian Empire (224\u2013651 CE), itself a continuation of Old Persian, which was used in the Achaemenid Empire (550\u2013330 BC). It originated in the region of Fars (Persia) in southwestern Iran. Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages.\nThroughout history, Persian was used as a prestigious language by various empires centered in Western Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. Old Persian is attested in Old Persian cuneiform on inscriptions from between the 6th and 4th century BC. Middle Persian is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts (Pahlavi and Manichaean) on inscriptions and in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD (\"See Middle Persian literature\"). New Persian literature was first recorded in the 9th century, after the Muslim conquest of Persia, since then adopting the Arabic script. Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world, with Persian poetry becoming a tradition in many eastern courts. It was used officially as a language of bureaucracy even by non-native speakers, such as the Ottomans in Asia Minor, the Mughals in South Asia, and the Pashtuns in Afghanistan. It influenced languages spoken in neighboring regions and beyond, including other Iranian languages, the Turkic languages, Armenian, Georgian, and the Indo-Aryan languages. It also exerted some influence on Arabic, while borrowing a lot of vocabulary from it in the Middle Ages.\nSome of the famous works of Persian literature from the Middle Ages are the \"Shahnameh\" of Ferdowsi, the works of Rumi, the \"Rubaiyat\" of Omar Khayyam, the \"Panj Ganj\" of Nizami Ganjavi, the \"Div\u0101n\" of Hafez, \"The Conference of the Birds\" by Attar of Nishapur, and the miscellanea of \"Gulistan\" and \"Bustan\" by Saadi Shirazi. Some of the prominent modern Persian poets were Nima Yooshij, Ahmad Shamlou, Simin Behbahani, Sohrab Sepehri, Rahi Mo'ayyeri, Mehdi Akhavan-Sales, and Forugh Farrokhzad.\nThere are approximately 110 million Persian speakers worldwide, including Persians, Tajiks, Hazaras, Caucasian Tats and Aimaqs. The term \"Persophone\" might also be used to refer to a speaker of Persian.\nClassification.\nPersian is a member of the Western Iranian group of the Iranian languages, which make up a branch of the Indo-European languages in their Indo-Iranian subdivision. The Western Iranian languages themselves are divided into two subgroups: Southwestern Iranian languages, of which Persian is the most widely spoken, and Northwestern Iranian languages, of which Kurdish is the most widely spoken.\nName.\nThe term \"Persian\" is an English derivation of Latin , the adjectival form of , itself deriving from Greek (), a Hellenized form of Old Persian (), which means \"Persia\" (a region in southwestern Iran, corresponding to modern-day Fars). According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the term \"Persian\" as a language name is first attested in English in the mid-16th century.\n\"Farsi\", which is the Persian word for the Persian language, has also been used widely in English in recent decades, more often to refer to Iran's standard Persian. However, the name \"Persian\" is still more widely used. The Academy of Persian Language and Literature has maintained that the endonym \"Farsi\" is to be avoided in foreign languages, and that \"Persian\" is the appropriate designation of the language in English, as it has the longer tradition in western languages and better expresses the role of the language as a mark of cultural and national continuity. Iranian historian and linguist Ehsan Yarshater, founder of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" and Columbia University's Center for Iranian Studies, mentions the same concern in an academic journal on Iranology, rejecting the use of \"Farsi\" in foreign languages.\nEtymologically, the Persian term derives from its earlier form ( in Middle Persian), which in turn comes from the same root as the English term \"Persian\". In the same process, the Middle Persian toponym (\"Persia\") evolved into the modern name Fars. The phonemic shift from to is due to the influence of Arabic in the Middle Ages, and is because of the lack of the phoneme in Standard Arabic.\nStandard varieties' names.\nIran's standard Persian has been called, apart from \"Persian\" and \"Farsi\", by names such as \"Iranian Persian\" and \"Western Persian\", exclusively. Officially, the official language of Iran is designated simply as \"Persian\" (, ).\nDari Persian (, ), that is the standard Persian of Afghanistan, has been officially named \"Dari\" (, ) since 1958. Also referred to as \"Afghan Persian\" in English, it is one of Afghanistan's two official languages, together with Pashto. The term \"Dari\", meaning \"of the court\", originally referred to the variety of Persian used in the court of the Sasanian Empire in capital Ctesiphon, which was spread to the northeast of the empire and gradually replaced the former Iranian dialects of Parthia (Parthian).\nTajik Persian (, ), that is the standard Persian of Tajikistan, has been officially designated as \"Tajik\" (, ) since the time of the Soviet Union. It is the name given to the varieties of Persian spoken in Central Asia, in general.\nISO codes.\nThe international language-encoding standard ISO 639-1 uses the code codice_1 for the Persian language, as its coding system is mostly based on the native-language designations. The more detailed standard ISO 639-3 uses the code codice_2 for the dialects spoken across Iran and Afghanistan. This consists of the individual languages Dari (codice_3) and Iranian Persian (codice_4). It uses codice_5 for Tajik, separately.\nHistory.\nIn general, the Iranian languages are known from three periods: namely Old, Middle, and New (Modern). These correspond to three historical eras of Iranian history; Old era being sometime around the Achaemenid Empire (i.e., 400\u2013300 BC), Middle era being the next period most officially around the Sasanian Empire, and New era being the period afterwards down to present day.\nAccording to available documents, the Persian language is \"the only Iranian language\" for which close philological relationships between all of its three stages are established and so that Old, Middle, and New Persian represent one and the same language of Persian; that is, New Persian is a direct descendant of Middle and Old Persian.\nThe known history of the Persian language can be divided into the following three distinct periods:\nOld Persian.\nAs a written language, Old Persian is attested in royal Achaemenid inscriptions. The oldest known text written in Old Persian is from the Behistun Inscription, dating to the time of King Darius I (reigned 522\u2013486 BC). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now Iran, Romania (Gherla), Armenia, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt. Old Persian is one of the oldest Indo-European languages which is attested in original texts.\nAccording to certain historical assumptions about the early history and origin of ancient Persians in Southwestern Iran (where Achaemenids hailed from), Old Persian was originally spoken by a tribe called \"Parsuwash\", who arrived in the Iranian Plateau early in the 1st millennium BCE and finally migrated down into the area of present-day F\u0101rs province. Their language, Old Persian, became the official language of the Achaemenid kings. Assyrian records, which in fact appear to provide the earliest evidence for ancient Iranian (Persian and Median) presence on the Iranian Plateau, give a good chronology but only an approximate geographical indication of what seem to be ancient Persians. In these records of the 9th century BCE, \"Parsuwash\" (along with \"Matai\", presumably Medians) are first mentioned in the area of Lake Urmia in the records of Shalmaneser III. The exact identity of the Parsuwash is not known for certain, but from a linguistic viewpoint the word matches Old Persian \"p\u0101rsa\" itself coming directly from the older word \"*p\u0101r\u0107wa\". Also, as Old Persian contains many words from another extinct Iranian language, Median, according to P. O. Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8 it is probable that Old Persian had already been spoken before the formation of the Achaemenid Empire and was spoken during most of the first half of the first millennium BCE. Xenophon, a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions, describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BCE, which is when Old Persian was still spoken and extensively used. He relates that the Armenian people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians.\nRelated to Old Persian, but from a different branch of the Iranian language family, was Avestan, the language of the Zoroastrian liturgical texts.\nMiddle Persian.\nThe complex grammatical conjugation and declension of Old Persian yielded to the structure of Middle Persian in which the dual number disappeared, leaving only singular and plural, as did gender. Middle Persian developed the ez\u0101fe construction, expressed through \"\u012b\" (modern \"ye\"), to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system.\nAlthough the \"middle period\" of the Iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the transition from Old to Middle Persian had probably already begun before the 4th century BC. However, Middle Persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the Sassanid era (224\u2013651 AD) inscriptions, so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty. Moreover, as a literary language, Middle Persian is not attested until much later, in the 6th or 7th century. From the 8th century onward, Middle Persian gradually began yielding to New Persian, with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of Zoroastrianism.\nMiddle Persian is considered to be a later form of the same dialect as Old Persian. The native name of Middle Persian was \"Parsig\" or \"Parsik\", after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest, that is, \"of \"Pars\"\", Old Persian \"Parsa\", New Persian \"Fars\". This is the origin of the name \"Farsi\" as it is today used to signify New Persian. Following the collapse of the Sassanid state, \"Parsik\" came to be applied exclusively to (either Middle or New) Persian that was written in the Arabic script. From about the 9th century onward, as Middle Persian was on the threshold of becoming New Persian, the older form of the language came to be erroneously called \"Pahlavi\", which was actually but one of the \"writing systems\" used to render both Middle Persian as well as various other Middle Iranian languages. That writing system had previously been adopted by the Sassanids (who were Persians, i.e. from the southwest) from the preceding Arsacids (who were Parthians, i.e. from the northeast). While Ibn al-Muqaffa' (eighth century) still distinguished between \"Pahlavi\" (i.e. Parthian) and \"Persian\" (in Arabic text: al-Farisiyah) (i.e. Middle Persian), this distinction is not evident in Arab commentaries written after that date.\nGernot Windfuhr considers new Persian as an evolution of the Old Persian language and the Middle Persian language but also states that none of the known Middle Persian dialects is the direct predecessor of Modern Persian. Ludwig Paul states: \"The language of the Shahnameh should be seen as one instance of continuous historical development from Middle to New Persian.\"\nNew Persian.\n\"New Persian\" (also referred to as Modern Persian) is conventionally divided into three stages:\nEarly New Persian remains largely intelligible to speakers of Contemporary Persian, as the morphology and, to a lesser extent, the lexicon of the language have remained relatively stable.\nEarly New Persian.\n\"New Persian\" is taken to replace Middle Persian in the course of the 8th to 9th centuries, under Abbasid rule.\nWith the decline of the Abbasids began the re-establishment of Persian national life and Persians laid the foundations for a renaissance in the realm of letters. New Persian as an independent literary language first emerges in Bactria through the adaptation of the spoken form of Sassanian Middle Persian court language called \"P\u0101rsi-ye Dari\". The cradle of the Persian literary renaissance lay in the east of Greater Iran in Greater Khorasan and Transoxiana close to the Amu Darya (modern day Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan). The vocabulary of the New Persian language was thus heavily influenced by other Eastern Iranian languages, particularly Sogdian.\nThe mastery of the newer speech having now been transformed from Middle into New Persian was already complete by the era of the three princely dynasties of Iranian origin, the Tahirid dynasty (820\u2013872), Saffarid dynasty (860\u2013903) and Samanid Empire (874\u2013999), and could develop only in range and power of expression.\nAbbas of Merv is mentioned as being the earliest minstrel to chant verse in the newer Persian tongue and after him the poems of Hanzala Badghisi were among the most famous between the Persian-speakers of the time.\nThe first poems of the Persian language, a language historically called Dari, emerged in Afghanistan. The first significant Persian poet was Rudaki. He flourished in the 10th century, when the Samanids were at the height of their power. His reputation as a court poet and as an accomplished musician and singer has survived, although little of his poetry has been preserved. Among his lost works is versified fables collected in the \"Kalila wa Dimna\".\nThe language spread geographically from the 11th century on and was the medium through which among others, Central Asian Turks became familiar with Islam and urban culture. New Persian was widely used as a trans-regional lingua franca, a task for which it was particularly suitable due to its relatively simple morphological structure and this situation persisted until at least the 19th century. In the late Middle Ages, new Islamic literary languages were created on the Persian model: Ottoman Turkish, Chagatai, Dobhashi and Urdu, which are regarded as \"structural daughter languages\" of Persian.\nClassical Persian.\n\"Classical Persian\" loosely refers to the standardized language of medieval Persia used in literature and poetry.\nThis is the language of the 10th to 12th centuries, which continued to be used as literary language and lingua franca under the \"Persianized\" Turko-Mongol dynasties during the 12th to 15th centuries, and under restored Persian rule during the 16th to 19th centuries.\nPersian during this time served as lingua franca of Greater Persia and of much of the Indian subcontinent.\nIt was also the official and cultural language of many Islamic dynasties, including the Samanids, Buyids, Tahirids, Ziyarids, the Mughal Empire, Timurids, Ghaznavids, Karakhanids, Seljuqs, Khwarazmians, the Sultanate of Rum, Delhi Sultanate, the Shirvanshahs, Safavids, Afsharids, Zands, Qajars, Khanate of Bukhara, Khanate of Kokand, Emirate of Bukhara, Khanate of Khiva, Ottomans and also many Mughal successors such as the Nizam of Hyderabad.\nPersian was the only non-European language known and used by Marco Polo at the Court of Kublai Khan and in his journeys through China.\nA branch of the Seljuks, the Sultanate of Rum, took Persian language, art and letters to Anatolia. They adopted Persian language as the official language of the empire. The Ottomans, who can roughly be seen as their eventual successors, took this tradition over. Persian was the official court language of the empire, and for some time, the official language of the empire. The educated and noble class of the Ottoman Empire all spoke Persian, such as Sultan Selim I, despite being Safavid Iran's archrival and a staunch opposer of Shia Islam. It was a major literary language in the empire. Some of the noted earlier Persian works during the Ottoman rule are Idris Bidlisi's \"Hasht Bihisht\", which began in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight Ottoman rulers, and the \"Salim-Namah\", a glorification of Selim I. After a period of several centuries, Ottoman Turkish (which was highly Persianised itself) had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature, which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation. However, the number of Persian and Arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88%. In the Ottoman Empire, Persian was used for diplomacy, poetry, historiographical works, literary works, and was taught in state schools.\nThe Persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages in West Asia, Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia. Following the Turko-Persian Ghaznavid conquest of South Asia, Persian was firstly introduced in the region by Turkic Central Asians. The basis in general for the introduction of Persian language into the subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties. For five centuries prior to the British colonization, Persian was widely used as a second language in the Indian subcontinent, due to the admiration the Mughals (who were of Turco-Mongol origin) had for the foreign language. It took prominence as the language of culture and education in several Muslim courts on the subcontinent and became the sole \"official language\" under the Mughal emperors.\nThe Bengal Sultanate witnessed an influx of Persian scholars, lawyers, teachers and clerics. Thousands of Persian books and manuscripts were published in Bengal. The period of the reign of Sultan Ghiyathuddin Azam Shah, is described as the \"golden age of Persian literature in Bengal\". Its stature was illustrated by the Sultan's own correspondence and collaboration with the Persian poet Hafez; a poem which can be found in the \"Divan of Hafez\" today. A Bengali dialect emerged amongst the common Bengali Muslim folk, based on a Persian model and known as Dobhashi; meaning \"mixed language\". Dobhashi Bengali was patronised and given official status under the Sultans of Bengal; whose first language was Persian, and was the most popular literary form used by Bengalis during the pre-colonial period, irrespective of their religion. \nFollowing the defeat of the Hindu Shahi dynasty, classical Persian was established as a courtly language in the region during the late 10th century under Ghaznavid rule over the northwestern frontier of the subcontinent. Employed by Punjabis in literature, Persian achieved prominence in the region during the following centuries. Persian continued to act as a courtly language for various empires in Punjab through the early 19th century serving finally as the official state language of the Sikh Empire, preceding British conquest and the decline of Persian in South Asia.\nBeginning in 1843, though, English and Hindustani gradually replaced Persian in importance on the subcontinent. Evidence of Persian's historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on certain languages of the Indian subcontinent. Words borrowed from Persian are still quite commonly used in certain Indo-Aryan languages, especially Urdu (also historically known as Hindustani), Punjabi, Kashmiri and Sindhi. There is also a small population of Zoroastrian Iranis in India, who migrated in the 19th century to escape religious execution in Qajar Iran and speak a Dari dialect.\nContemporary Persian.\nIn the 19th century, under the Qajar dynasty, the dialect that is spoken in Tehran rose to prominence. There was still substantial Arabic vocabulary, but many of these words have been integrated into Persian phonology and grammar. In addition, under the Qajar rule numerous Russian, French, and English terms entered the Persian language, especially vocabulary related to technology.\nThe first official attentions to the necessity of protecting the Persian language against foreign words, and to the standardization of Persian orthography, were under the reign of Naser ed Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty in 1871. After Naser ed Din Shah, Mozaffar ed Din Shah ordered the establishment of the first Persian association in 1903. This association officially declared that it used Persian and Arabic as acceptable sources for coining words. The ultimate goal was to prevent books from being printed with wrong use of words. According to the executive guarantee of this association, the government was responsible for wrongfully printed books. Words coined by this association, such as \"r\u0101h-\u0101han\" () for \"railway\", were printed in \"Soltani Newspaper\"; but the association was eventually closed due to inattention.\nA scientific association was founded in 1911, resulting in a dictionary called \"Words of Scientific Association\" (), which was completed in the future and renamed \"Katouzian Dictionary\" ().\nThe first academy for the Persian language was founded on 20 May 1935, under the name \"Academy of Iran\". It was established by the initiative of Reza Shah Pahlavi, and mainly by Hekmat e Shirazi and Mohammad Ali Foroughi, all prominent names in the nationalist movement of the time. \nThe academy was a key institution in the struggle to re-build Iran as a nation-state after the collapse of the Qajar dynasty. During the 1930s and 1940s, the academy led massive campaigns to replace the many Arabic, Russian, French, and Greek loanwords whose widespread use in Persian during the centuries preceding the foundation of the Pahlavi dynasty had created a literary language considerably different from the spoken Persian of the time. This became the basis of what is now known as \"Contemporary Standard Persian\".\nVarieties.\nThere are three standard varieties of modern Persian:\nAll these three varieties are based on the classic Persian literature and its literary tradition. There are also several local dialects from Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard Persian. The Hazaragi dialect (in Central Afghanistan and Pakistan), Herati (in Western Afghanistan), Darwazi (in Afghanistan and Tajikistan), Basseri (in Southern Iran), and the Tehrani accent (in Iran, the basis of standard Iranian Persian) are examples of these dialects. Persian-speaking peoples of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibility. Nevertheless, the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" notes that the Iranian, Afghan and Tajiki varieties comprise distinct branches of the Persian language, and within each branch a wide variety of local dialects exist.\nThe following are some languages closely related to Persian, or in some cases are considered dialects:\nMore distantly related branches of the Iranian language family include Kurdish and Balochi.\nPhonology.\nIranian Persian has six vowels and twenty-three consonants.\nVowels.\nHistorically, Persian distinguished length. Early New Persian had a series of five long vowels (, , , and ) along with three short vowels , and . At some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern Iran, and merged into , and and merged into . Thus, older contrasts such as \"sh\u0113r\" \"lion\" vs. \"sh\u012br\" \"milk\", and \"z\u016bd\" \"quick\" vs \"z\u014dr\" \"strong\" were lost. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and in some words, \"\u0113\" and \"\u014d\" are merged into the diphthongs and (which are descendants of the diphthongs and in Early New Persian), instead of merging into and . Examples of the exception can be found in words such as (bright). Numerous other instances exist.\nHowever, in Dari, the archaic distinction of and (respectively known as \"Y\u0101-ye majh\u016bl\" and \"Y\u0101-ye ma'r\u016bf\") is still preserved as well as the distinction of and (known as \"W\u0101w-e majh\u016bl\" and \"W\u0101w-e ma'r\u016bf\"). On the other hand, in standard Tajik, the length distinction has disappeared, and merged with and with . Therefore, contemporary Afghan Dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of Early New Persian.\nAccording to most studies on the subject (e.g. Samareh 1977, Pisowicz 1985, Najafi 2001), the three vowels traditionally considered long (, , ) are currently distinguished from their short counterparts (, , ) by position of articulation rather than by length. However, there are studies (e.g. Hayes 1979, Windfuhr 1979) that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system, with , , and phonologically long or bimoraic and , , and phonologically short or monomoraic.\nThere are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the Iranian system (such as Toosarvandani 2004). That offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity, which often suggests that Modern Persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of Classical Persian and a hypothetical future Iranian language, which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature.\nThe length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties (including Tajik).\nConsonants.\nNotes:\nGrammar.\nMorphology.\nSuffixes predominate Persian morphology, though there are a small number of prefixes. Verbs can express tense and aspect, and they agree with the subject in person and number. There is no grammatical gender in modern Persian, and pronouns are not marked for natural gender. In other words, in Persian, pronouns are gender neutral. When referring to a masculine or a feminine subject the same pronoun is used (pronounced \"ou\", \u016b).\nSyntax.\nNormal declarative sentences are structured as \"(S) (PP) (O) V\": sentences have optional subjects, prepositional phrases, and objects followed by a compulsory verb. If the object is specific, the object is followed by the word \"r\u0101\" and precedes prepositional phrases: \"(S) (O + \"r\u0101\") (PP) V\".\nVocabulary.\nNative word formation.\nPersian makes extensive use of word building and combining affixes, stems, nouns and adjectives. Persian frequently uses derivational agglutination to form new words from nouns, adjectives, and verbal stems. New words are extensively formed by compounding \u2013 two existing words combining into a new one.\nInfluences.\nWhile having a lesser influence on Arabic and other languages of Mesopotamia and its core vocabulary being of Middle Persian origin, New Persian contains a considerable number of Arabic lexical items, which were Persianized and often took a different meaning and usage than the Arabic original. Persian loanwords of Arabic origin especially include Islamic terms. The Arabic vocabulary in other Iranian, Turkic and Indic languages is generally understood to have been copied from New Persian, not from Arabic itself.\nJohn R. Perry, in his article \"Lexical Areas and Semantic Fields of Arabic\", estimates that about 24 percent of an everyday vocabulary of 20,000 words in current Persian, and more than 25 percent of the vocabulary of classical and modern Persian literature, are of Arabic origin. The text frequency of these loan words is generally lower and varies by style and topic area. It may approach 25 percent of a text in literature. According to another source, about 40% of everyday Persian literary vocabulary is of Arabic origin. Among the Arabic loan words, relatively few (14 percent) are from the semantic domain of material culture, while a larger number are from domains of intellectual and spiritual life. Most of the Arabic words used in Persian are either synonyms of native terms or could be glossed in Persian.\nThe inclusion of Mongolic and Turkic elements in the Persian language should also be mentioned, not only because of the political role a succession of Turkic dynasties played in Iranian history, but also because of the immense prestige Persian language and literature enjoyed in the wider (non-Arab) Islamic world, which was often ruled by sultans and emirs with a Turkic background. The Turkish and Mongolian vocabulary in Persian is minor in comparison to that of Arabic and these words were mainly confined to military, pastoral terms and political sector (titles, administration, etc.). New military and political titles were coined based partially on Middle Persian (e.g. \"arte\u0161\" for \"army\", instead of the Uzbek \"qo\u02bbshin\"; \"sarla\u0161kar\"; \"dary\u0101b\u0101n\"; etc.) in the 20th century.\nPersian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially other Indo-European languages such as Armenian, Urdu, Bengali and (to a lesser extent) Hindi; the latter three through conquests of Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan invaders; Turkic languages such as Ottoman Turkish, Chagatai, Tatar, Turkish, Turkmen, Azeri, Uzbek, and Karachay-Balkar; Caucasian languages such as Georgian, and to a lesser extent, Avar and Lezgin; Afro-Asiatic languages like Assyrian (List of loanwords in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic) and Arabic, particularly Bahrani Arabic; and even Dravidian languages indirectly especially Tamil, Telugu and Brahui; as well as Austronesian languages such as Indonesian and Malay. Persian has also had a significant lexical influence, via Turkish, on Albanian, Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbo-Croatian, particularly as spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nUse of occasional foreign synonyms instead of Persian words can be a common practice in everyday communications as an alternative expression. In some instances in addition to the Persian vocabulary, the equivalent synonyms from multiple foreign languages can be used. For example, in Iranian colloquial Persian (not in Afghanistan or Tajikistan), the phrase \"thank you\" may be expressed using the French word \"merci\" (stressed, however, on the first syllable), the hybrid Persian-Arabic phrase \"mote\u0161akkeram\" ( \"mote\u0161akker\" being \"thankful\" in Arabic, commonly pronounced \"mo\u010d\u010dakker\" in Persian, and the verb \"am\" meaning \"I am\" in Persian), or by the pure Persian phrase \"sep\u0101s-goz\u0101ram\".\nOrthography.\nThe vast majority of modern Iranian Persian and Dari text is written with the Arabic script. Tajiki, which is considered by some linguists to be a Persian dialect influenced by Russian and the Turkic languages of Central Asia, is written with the Cyrillic script in Tajikistan (see Tajik alphabet). There also exist several romanization systems for Persian.\nPersian alphabet.\nModern Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian are written using the Persian alphabet which is a modified variant of the Arabic alphabet, which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in Arabic language. After the Arab conquest of Persia, it took approximately 200 years, which is referred to as Two Centuries of Silence in Iran, before Persians adopted the Arabic script in place of the older alphabet. Previously, two different scripts were used, Pahlavi, used for Middle Persian, and the Avestan alphabet (in Persian, D\u012bndapirak or Din Dabire\u2014literally: religion script), used for religious purposes, primarily for the Avestan but sometimes for Middle Persian.\nIn the modern Persian script, historically short vowels are usually not written, only the historically long ones are represented in the text, so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing: Iranian Persian ' \"worm\", ' \"generosity\", ' \"cream\", and ' \"chrome\" are all spelled \"\" () in Persian. The reader must determine the word from context. The Arabic system of vocalization marks known as \"harakat\" is also used in Persian, although some of the symbols have different pronunciations. For example, a \"\u1e0dammah\" is pronounced , while in Iranian Persian it is pronounced . This system is not used in mainstream Persian literature; it is primarily used for teaching and in some (but not all) dictionaries.\nThere are several letters generally only used in Arabic loanwords. These letters are pronounced the same as similar Persian letters. For example, there are four functionally identical letters for (), three letters for (), two letters for (), two letters for ().\nOn the other hand, there are four letters that don't exist in Arabic .\nAdditions.\nThe Persian alphabet adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet:\nHistorically, there was also a special letter for the sound . This letter is no longer used, as the /\u03b2/-sound changed to /b/, e.g. archaic /za\u03b2\u0101n/ &gt; /z\u00e6b\u0252n/ 'language'\nVariations.\nThe Persian alphabet also modifies some letters of the Arabic alphabet. For example, \"alef with hamza below\" ( ) changes to \"alef\" ( ); words using various hamzas get spelled with yet another kind of hamza (so that becomes ) even though the latter is also correct in Arabic; and \"teh marbuta\" ( ) changes to \"heh\" ( ) or \"teh\" ( ).\nThe letters different in shape are:\nLatin alphabet.\nThe International Organization for Standardization has published a standard for simplified transliteration of Persian into Latin, ISO 233-3, titled \"Information and documentation \u2013 Transliteration of Arabic characters into Latin characters \u2013 Part 3: Persian language \u2013 Simplified transliteration\" but the transliteration scheme is not in widespread use.\nAnother Latin alphabet, based on the Common Turkic Alphabet, was used in Tajikistan in the 1920s and 1930s. The alphabet was phased out in favor of Cyrillic in the late 1930s.\nFingilish is Persian using ISO basic Latin alphabet. It is most commonly used in chat, emails and SMS applications. The orthography is not standardized, and varies among writers and even media (for example, typing 'aa' for the phoneme is easier on computer keyboards than on cellphone keyboards, resulting in smaller usage of the combination on cellphones).\nTajik alphabet.\nThe Cyrillic script was introduced for writing the Tajik language under the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in the late 1930s, replacing the Latin alphabet that had been used since the October Revolution and the Persian script that had been used earlier. After 1939, materials published in Persian in the Persian script were banned from the country.\nExamples.\nThe following text is from Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."}

She began her career as a flower girl and a street singer. It was also rumoured that she recited Shakespeare in taverns at the age of 12, along with being a prostitute for a short period to help her family with economical problems. Later, she became a servant to a French milliner. During that time, she learnt about costume and learnt French. Her early nickname, Nosegay Fan, came from her time as a flower girl. Her first appearance on stage was at Haymarket in 1755 as Miranda in Mrs Centlivre's play, \"Busybody\".\nIn 1755, she was recommended by Samuel Foote and joined the Drury Lane company, although being overshadowed by Hannah Pritchard and Kitty Clive. Her first success was in Ireland as Lady Townley (in \"The Provoked Husband\" by Vanbrugh and Cibber), and it was only after five years, on the pressing invitation of David Garrick, that she returned to Drury Lane. In 1759, after an unhappy marriage to her music teacher, the royal trumpeter James Abington, she was mentioned in the bills as \"Mrs. Abington\". She remained at the Drury Lane for 18 years, being the first to play more than 30 important characters, notably Lady Teazle (1777).\nIn April 1772, when James Northcote saw her as Miss Notable in Cibber's \"The Lady's Last Stake\", he remarked to his brother \nHer Shakespeare heroines \u2013 Beatrice, Portia, Desdemona and Ophelia \u2013 were no less successful than her comic characters \u2013 Miss Hoyden, Biddy Tipkin, Lucy Lockit and Miss Prue. Mrs. Abington's Kitty in \"High Life Below Stairs\" put her in the foremost rank of comic actresses, making the mob cap she wore in the role the reigning fashion. It was soon being referred to as the \"Abington Cap\" \u2013 on stage and at hatters' shops across Ireland and England. Abington soon became known for her avant-garde fashion and even came up with a way of making the female figure appear taller by wearing a tall hat called a ziggurat, complete with long flowing feathers, and following the French custom of putting red powder on her hair (Richards).\nIt was as the last character in Congreve's \"Love for Love\" that Sir Joshua Reynolds painted the best-known of his half-dozen or more portraits of her (\"illustration, left\"). In 1782 she left Drury Lane for Covent Garden. After an absence from the stage from 1790 until 1797, she reappeared, quitting finally in 1799."}
