It was discovered in 1874 by Henry John Stephen Smith and introduced by German mathematician Georg Cantor in 1883.\nThrough consideration of this set, Cantor and others helped lay the foundations of modern point-set topology. Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the Cantor ternary set, built by removing the middle third of a line segment and then repeating the process with the remaining shorter segments. Cantor himself mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense.\nConstruction and formula of the ternary set.\nThe Cantor ternary set formula_1 is created by iteratively deleting the \"open\" middle third from a set of line segments. One starts by deleting the open middle third (,\u00a0) from the interval [0,\u00a01], leaving two line segments: [0,\u00a0]\u00a0\u222a\u00a0[,\u00a01]. Next, the open middle third of each of these remaining segments is deleted, leaving four line segments: [0,\u00a0]\u00a0\u222a\u00a0[,\u00a0]\u00a0\u222a\u00a0[,\u00a0]\u00a0\u222a\u00a0[,\u00a01]. This process is continued ad infinitum, where the \"n\"th set is\nThe Cantor ternary set contains all points in the interval [0,\u00a01] that are not deleted at any step in this infinite process:\nThe first six steps of this process are illustrated below.\nUsing the idea of self-similar transformations, formula_4 and formula_5 the explicit closed formulas for the Cantor set are\nwhere every middle third is removed as the open interval formula_7 from the closed interval formula_8 surrounding it, or\nwhere the middle third formula_10 of the foregoing closed interval formula_11 is removed by intersecting with formula_12\nThis process of removing middle thirds is a simple example of a finite subdivision rule. The Cantor ternary set is an example of a fractal string.\nIn arithmetical terms, the Cantor set consists of all real numbers of the unit interval formula_13 that do not require the digit 1 in order to be expressed as a ternary (base 3) fraction. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point.\nComposition.\nSince the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., measure) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed. This total is the geometric progression\nSo that the proportion left is 1 \u2013 1 = 0.\nThis calculation suggests that the Cantor set cannot contain any interval of non-zero length. It may seem surprising that there should be anything left\u2014after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the \"middle third\" of each interval involved removing open sets (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (, ) from the original interval [0,\u00a01] leaves behind the points and . Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining. So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).\nIt may appear that \"only\" the endpoints of the construction segments are left, but that is not the case either. The number , for example, has the unique ternary form 0.020202... = . It is in the bottom third, and the top third of that third, and the bottom third of that top third, and so on. Since it is never in one of the middle segments, it is never removed. Yet it is also not an endpoint of any middle segment, because it is not a multiple of any power of 1/3.\nAll endpoints of segments are \"terminating\" ternary fractions and are contained in the set\nwhich is a countably infinite set.\nAs to cardinality, almost all elements of the Cantor set are not endpoints of intervals,\nand the whole Cantor set is not countable.\nProperties.\nCardinality.\nIt can be shown that there are as many points left behind in this process as there were to begin with, and that therefore, the Cantor set is uncountable. To see this, we show that there is a function \"f\" from the Cantor set formula_1 to the closed interval [0,1] that is surjective (i.e. \"f\" maps from formula_1 onto [0,1]) so that the cardinality of formula_1 is no less than that of [0,1]. Since formula_1 is a subset of [0,1], its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem.\nTo construct this function, consider the points in the [0,\u00a01] interval in terms of base 3 (or ternary) notation. \nRecall that the proper ternary fractions, more precisely: the elements of formula_20, admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example , that can be written as 0.13 = 3, but also as 0.0222...3 = 3, and , that can be written as 0.23 = 3 but also as 0.1222...3 = 3.\nWhen we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx...3 where xxxxx...3 is strictly between 00000...3 and 22222...3. So the numbers remaining after the first step consist of\nThis can be summarized by saying that those numbers with a ternary representation such that the first digit after the radix point is not 1 are the ones remaining after the first step.\nThe second step removes numbers of the form 0.01xxxx...3 and 0.21xxxx...3, and (with appropriate care for the endpoints) it can be concluded that the remaining numbers are those with a ternary numeral where neither of the first \"two\" digits is 1.\nContinuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded at step \"n\", it must have a ternary representation whose \"n\"th digit is not 1. For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s.\nIt is worth emphasizing that numbers like 1, = 0.13 and = 0.213 are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 = 0.222...3 = 3, = 0.0222...3 = 3 and = 0.20222...3 = 3.\nAll the latter numbers are \u201cendpoints\u201d, and these examples are right limit points of formula_1. The same is true for the left limit points of formula_1, e.g. = 0.1222...3 = 3 = 3 and = 0.21222...3 = 3 = 3. All these endpoints are \"proper ternary\" fractions (elements of formula_23) of the form , where denominator \"q\" is a power of 3 when the fraction is in its irreducible form. The ternary representation of these fractions terminates (i.\u00a0e. is finite) or \u2014 recall from above that proper ternary fractions each have 2 representations \u2014 is infinite and \u201cends\u201d in either infinitely many recurring 0s or infinitely many recurring 2s. Such a fraction is a left limit point of formula_1 if its ternary representation contains no 1's and \u201cends\u201d in infinitely many recurring 0s. Similarly, a proper ternary fraction is a right limit point of formula_1 if it again its ternary expansion contains no 1's and \u201cends\u201d in infinitely many recurring 2s.\nThis set of endpoints is dense in formula_1 (but not dense in [0, 1]) and makes up a countably infinite set. The numbers in formula_1 which are \"not\" endpoints also have only 0s and 2s in their ternary representation, but they cannot end in an infinite repetition of the digit 0, nor of the digit 2, because then it would be an endpoint.\nThe function from formula_1 to [0,1] is defined by taking the ternary numerals that do consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a binary representation of a real number. In a formula,\nFor any number \"y\" in [0,1], its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number \"x\" in formula_1 by replacing all the 1s by 2s. With this, \"f\"(\"x\") = \"y\" so that \"y\" is in the range of \"f\". For instance if \"y\" = 3\u20445 = 0.100110011001...2 = , we write \"x\" = = 0.200220022002...3 = 7\u204410. Consequently, \"f\" is surjective. However, \"f\" is \"not\" injective \u2014 the values for which \"f\"(\"x\") coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the \"middle thirds\" removed. For instance, take\nso\nThus there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in the interval [0,\u00a01] (which has the uncountable cardinality However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is 1\u20444, which can be written as 0.020202...3 = in ternary notation. In fact, given any formula_35, there exist formula_36 such that formula_37. This was first demonstrated by Steinhaus in 1917, who proved, via a geometric argument, the equivalent assertion that formula_38 for every formula_35. Since this construction provides an injection from formula_40 to formula_41, we have formula_42 as an immediate corollary. Assuming that formula_43 for any infinite set formula_44 (a statement shown to be equivalent to the axiom of choice by Tarski), this provides another demonstration that formula_45.\nThe Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even dense in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.\nIt has been conjectured that all algebraic irrational numbers are normal. Since members of the Cantor set are not normal, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or transcendental.\nSelf-similarity.\nThe Cantor set is the prototype of a fractal. It is self-similar, because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, the Cantor set is equal to the union of two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations of itself, formula_46 and formula_47, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to homeomorphism: formula_48\nRepeated iteration of formula_49 and formula_50 can be visualized as an infinite binary tree. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set formula_51 together with function composition forms a monoid, the dyadic monoid.\nThe automorphisms of the binary tree are its hyperbolic rotations, and are given by the modular group. Thus, the Cantor set is a homogeneous space in the sense that for any two points formula_52 and formula_53 in the Cantor set formula_1, there exists a homeomorphism formula_55 with formula_56. An explicit construction of formula_57 can be described more easily if we see the Cantor set as a product space of countably many copies of the discrete space formula_58. Then the map formula_59 defined by formula_60 is an involutive homeomorphism exchanging formula_52 and formula_53.\nConservation law.\nIt has been found that some form of conservation law is always responsible behind scaling and self-similarity. In the case of Cantor set it can be seen that the formula_63th moment (where formula_64 is the fractal dimension) of all the surviving intervals at any stage of the construction process is equal to constant which is equal to one in the case of Cantor set \n. We know that there are formula_65 intervals of size formula_66\npresent in the system at the formula_67th step of its construction. Then if we label the surviving intervals\nas formula_68 then the formula_63th moment is formula_70 since formula_71.\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is equal to ln(2)/ln(3)\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.631.\nTopological and analytical properties.\nAlthough \"the\" Cantor set typically refers to the original, middle-thirds Cantor described above, topologists often talk about \"a\" Cantor set, which means any topological space that is homeomorphic (topologically equivalent) to it.\nAs the above summation argument shows, the Cantor set is uncountable but has Lebesgue measure 0. Since the Cantor set is the complement of a union of open sets, it itself is a closed subset of the reals, and therefore a complete metric space. Since it is also totally bounded, the Heine\u2013Borel theorem says that it must be compact.\nFor any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s. Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an accumulation point (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an interior point. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a perfect set in topology, while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is nowhere dense in the interval.\nEvery point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the complement of the Cantor set.\nFor any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ \u2014 one will have 0 and the other 2. By splitting the Cantor set into \"halves\" depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points. In the relative topology on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a clopen set. Consequently, the Cantor set is totally disconnected. As a compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space, the Cantor set is an example of a Stone space.\nAs a topological space, the Cantor set is naturally homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the space formula_72, where each copy carries the discrete topology. This is the space of all sequences in two digits \nwhich can also be identified with the set of 2-adic integers. The basis for the open sets of the product topology are cylinder sets; the homeomorphism maps these to the subspace topology that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real number line. This characterization of the Cantor space as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via Tychonoff's theorem.\nFrom the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the p-adic integers, and, if one point is removed from it, to the p-adic numbers.\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a metric space with respect to the ordinary distance metric; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the p-adic metric on formula_74: given two sequences formula_75, the distance between them is formula_76, where formula_77 is the smallest index such that formula_78; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same topology on the Cantor set.\nWe have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See Cantor space for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.\nThe Cantor set is sometimes regarded as \"universal\" in the category of compact metric spaces, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not universal in the precise categorical sense. The \"universal\" property has important applications in functional analysis, where it is sometimes known as the \"representation theorem for compact metric spaces\".\nFor any integer \"q\" \u2265 2, the topology on the group G=Z\"q\"\u03c9 (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the Pontrjagin dual \u0393 is also Z\"q\"\u03c9, the topology of \u0393 is compact. One can see that \u0393 is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case \"q\"=2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)\nThe geometric mean of the Cantor set is approximately 0.274974.\nMeasure and probability.\nThe Cantor set can be seen as the compact group of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural Haar measure. When normalized so that the measure of the set is 1, it is a model of an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual Lebesgue measure on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a singular measure. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any probability, making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.\nIn Lebesgue measure theory, the Cantor set is an example of a set which is uncountable and has zero measure.\nCantor numbers.\nIf we define a Cantor number as a member of the Cantor set, then\nDescriptive set theory.\nThe Cantor set is a meager set (or a set of first category) as a subset of [0,1] (although not as a subset of itself, since it is a Baire space). The Cantor set thus demonstrates that notions of \"size\" in terms of cardinality, measure, and (Baire) category need not coincide. Like the set formula_79, the Cantor set formula_1 is \"small\" in the sense that it is a null set (a set of measure zero) and it is a meager subset of [0,1]. However, unlike formula_79, which is countable and has a \"small\" cardinality, formula_82, the cardinality of formula_1 is the same as that of [0,1], the continuum formula_84, and is \"large\" in the sense of cardinality. In fact, it is also possible to construct a subset of [0,1] that is meager but of positive measure and a subset that is non-meager but of measure zero: By taking the countable union of \"fat\" Cantor sets formula_85 of measure formula_86 (see Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set below for the construction), we obtain a set formula_87which has a positive measure (equal to 1) but is meager in [0,1], since each formula_85 is nowhere dense. Then consider the set formula_89. Since formula_90, formula_91 cannot be meager, but since formula_92, formula_91 must have measure zero.\nVariants.\nSmith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set.\nInstead of repeatedly removing the middle third of every piece as in the Cantor set, we could also keep removing any other fixed percentage (other than 0% and 100%) from the middle. In the case where the middle 8\u204410 of the interval is removed, we get a remarkably accessible case \u2014 the set consists of all numbers in [0,1] that can be written as a decimal consisting entirely of 0s and 9s. If a fixed percentage is removed at each stage, then the limiting set will have measure zero, since the length of the remainder formula_94 as formula_95 for any \"f\" such that formula_96.\nOn the other hand, \"fat Cantor sets\" of positive measure can be generated by removal of smaller fractions of the middle of the segment in each iteration. Thus, one can construct sets homeomorphic to the Cantor set that have positive Lebesgue measure while still being nowhere dense. If an interval of length formula_97 (formula_98) is removed from the middle of each segment at the \"n\"th iteration, then the total length removed is formula_99, and the limiting set will have a Lebesgue measure of formula_100. Thus, in a sense, the middle-thirds Cantor set is a limiting case with formula_101. If formula_102, then the remainder will have positive measure with formula_103. The case formula_104 is known as the Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set, which has a Lebesgue measure of formula_105.\nStochastic Cantor set.\nOne can modify the construction of the Cantor set by dividing randomly instead of equally. Besides, to incorporate time we can divide only one of the available intervals at each step instead of dividing all the available intervals. In the case of stochastic triadic Cantor set the resulting process can be described by the following rate equation\nand for the stochastic dyadic Cantor set\nwhere formula_108 is the number of intervals of size between formula_52 and formula_110. In the case of triadic Cantor set the fractal dimension is formula_111 which is \nless than its deterministic counterpart formula_112. In the case of stochastic dyadic Cantor set\nthe fractal dimension is formula_113 which is again less than that of its deterministic counterpart formula_114. In the case of stochastic dyadic Cantor set the solution for formula_115 exhibits dynamic scaling as its solution in the long-time limit is formula_116 where the fractal dimension of the stochastic dyadic Cantor set formula_117. In either case, like triadic Cantor set, the formula_63th moment (formula_119) of stochastic triadic and dyadic Cantor set too are conserved quantities.\nCantor dust.\nCantor dust is a multi-dimensional version of the Cantor set. It can be formed by taking a finite Cartesian product of the Cantor set with itself, making it a Cantor space. Like the Cantor set, Cantor dust has zero measure.\nA different 2D analogue of the Cantor set is the Sierpinski carpet, where a square is divided up into nine smaller squares, and the middle one removed. The remaining squares are then further divided into nine each and the middle removed, and so on ad infinitum. One 3D analogue of this is the Menger sponge.\nChristopher Domas presented a interactive binary visualization tool based on cantor dust at Black Hat USA 2012.\nHistorical remarks.\nCantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, and mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense. The original paper provides several different constructions of the abstract concept.\nThis set would have been considered abstract at the time when Cantor devised it. Cantor himself was led to it by practical concerns about the set of points where a trigonometric series might fail to converge. The discovery did much to set him on the course for developing an abstract, general theory of infinite sets."}
{"id": "6173", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6173", "title": "Cardinal number", "text": "In mathematics, cardinal numbers, or cardinals for short, are a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets. The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number: the number of elements in the set. The \"transfinite\" cardinal numbers, often denoted using the Hebrew symbol formula_1 (aleph) followed by a subscript, describe the sizes of infinite sets.\nCardinality is defined in terms of bijective functions. Two sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the two sets. In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of size. In the case of infinite sets, the behavior is more complex. A fundamental theorem due to Georg Cantor shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities, and in particular the cardinality of the set of real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. It is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set\u2014something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets.\nThere is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers:\nThis sequence starts with the natural numbers including zero (finite cardinals), which are followed by the aleph numbers (infinite cardinals of well-ordered sets). The aleph numbers are indexed by ordinal numbers. Under the assumption of the axiom of choice, this transfinite sequence includes every cardinal number. If one rejects that axiom, the situation is more complicated, with additional infinite cardinals that are not alephs.\nCardinality is studied for its own sake as part of set theory. It is also a tool used in branches of mathematics including model theory, combinatorics, abstract algebra and mathematical analysis. In category theory, the cardinal numbers form a skeleton of the category of sets.\nHistory.\nThe notion of cardinality, as now understood, was formulated by Georg Cantor, the originator of set theory, in 1874\u20131884. Cardinality can be used to compare an aspect of finite sets. For example, the sets {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} are not \"equal\", but have the \"same cardinality\", namely three. This is established by the existence of a bijection (i.e., a one-to-one correspondence) between the two sets, such as the correspondence {1\u21924, 2\u21925, 3\u21926}.\nCantor applied his concept of bijection to infinite sets (for example the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}). Thus, he called all sets having a bijection with N denumerable (countably infinite) sets, which all share the same cardinal number. This cardinal number is called formula_3, aleph-null. He called the cardinal numbers of these infinite sets transfinite cardinal numbers.\nCantor proved that any unbounded subset of N has the same cardinality as N, even though this might appear to run contrary to intuition. He also proved that the set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers is denumerable; this implies that the set of all rational numbers is also denumerable, since every rational can be represented by a pair of integers. He later proved that the set of all real algebraic numbers is also denumerable. Each real algebraic number \"z\" may be encoded as a finite sequence of integers, which are the coefficients in the polynomial equation of which it is a solution, i.e. the ordered n-tuple (\"a\"0, \"a\"1, ..., \"an\"), \"ai\" \u2208 Z together with a pair of rationals (\"b\"0, \"b\"1) such that \"z\" is the unique root of the polynomial with coefficients (\"a\"0, \"a\"1, ..., \"an\") that lies in the interval (\"b\"0, \"b\"1).\nIn his 1874 paper \"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\", Cantor proved that there exist higher-order cardinal numbers, by showing that the set of real numbers has cardinality greater than that of N. His proof used an argument with nested intervals, but in an 1891 paper, he proved the same result using his ingenious but simpler diagonal argument. The new cardinal number of the set of real numbers is called the cardinality of the continuum and Cantor used the symbol formula_4 for it.\nCantor also developed a large portion of the general theory of cardinal numbers; he proved that there is a smallest transfinite cardinal number (formula_3, aleph-null), and that for every cardinal number there is a next-larger cardinal\nHis continuum hypothesis is the proposition that formula_4 is the same as formula_8. This hypothesis has been found to be independent of the standard axioms of mathematical set theory; it can neither be proved nor disproved from the standard assumptions.\nMotivation.\nIn informal use, a cardinal number is what is normally referred to as a \"counting number\", provided that 0 is included: 0, 1, 2, ... They may be identified with the natural numbers beginning with 0. The counting numbers are exactly what can be defined formally as the finite cardinal numbers. Infinite cardinals only occur in higher-level mathematics and logic.\nMore formally, a non-zero number can be used for two purposes: to describe the size of a set, or to describe the position of an element in a sequence. For finite sets and sequences it is easy to see that these two notions coincide, since for every number describing a position in a sequence we can construct a set which has exactly the right size. For example, 3 describes the position of 'c' in the sequence &lt;'a','b','c','d'...&gt;, and we can construct the set {a,b,c} which has 3 elements.\nHowever, when dealing with infinite sets, it is essential to distinguish between the two, since the two notions are in fact different for infinite sets. Considering the position aspect leads to ordinal numbers, while the size aspect is generalized by the cardinal numbers described here.\nThe intuition behind the formal definition of cardinal is the construction of a notion of the relative size or \"bigness\" of a set, without reference to the kind of members which it has. For finite sets this is easy; one simply counts the number of elements a set has. In order to compare the sizes of larger sets, it is necessary to appeal to more refined notions.\nA set \"Y\" is at least as big as a set \"X\" if there is an injective mapping from the elements of \"X\" to the elements of \"Y\". An injective mapping identifies each element of the set \"X\" with a unique element of the set \"Y\". This is most easily understood by an example; suppose we have the sets \"X\" = {1,2,3} and \"Y\" = {a,b,c,d}, then using this notion of size, we would observe that there is a mapping:\nwhich is injective, and hence conclude that \"Y\" has cardinality greater than or equal to \"X\". The element d has no element mapping to it, but this is permitted as we only require an injective mapping, and not necessarily an injective and onto mapping. The advantage of this notion is that it can be extended to infinite sets.\nWe can then extend this to an equality-style relation. Two sets \"X\" and \"Y\" are said to have the same \"cardinality\" if there exists a bijection between \"X\" and \"Y\". By the Schroeder\u2013Bernstein theorem, this is equivalent to there being \"both\" an injective mapping from \"X\" to \"Y\", \"and\" an injective mapping from \"Y\" to \"X\". We then write |\"X\"| = |\"Y\"|. The cardinal number of \"X\" itself is often defined as the least ordinal \"a\" with |\"a\"| = |\"X\"|. This is called the von Neumann cardinal assignment; for this definition to make sense, it must be proved that every set has the same cardinality as \"some\" ordinal; this statement is the well-ordering principle. It is however possible to discuss the relative cardinality of sets without explicitly assigning names to objects.\nThe classic example used is that of the infinite hotel paradox, also called Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel. Supposing there is an innkeeper at a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. The hotel is full, and then a new guest arrives. It is possible to fit the extra guest in by asking the guest who was in room 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on, leaving room 1 vacant. We can explicitly write a segment of this mapping:\nWith this assignment, we can see that the set {1,2,3...} has the same cardinality as the set {2,3,4...}, since a bijection between the first and the second has been shown. This motivates the definition of an infinite set being any set which has a proper subset of the same cardinality (i.e., a Dedekind-infinite set); in this case {2,3,4...} is a proper subset of {1,2,3...}.\nWhen considering these large objects, one might also want to see if the notion of counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets. It happens that it does not; by considering the above example we can see that if some object \"one greater than infinity\" exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set we started out with. It is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called ordinals, based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.\nIt can be proved that the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than that of the natural numbers just described. This can be visualized using Cantor's diagonal argument;\nclassic questions of cardinality (for instance the continuum hypothesis) are concerned with discovering whether there is some cardinal between some pair of other infinite cardinals. In more recent times, mathematicians have been describing the properties of larger and larger cardinals.\nSince cardinality is such a common concept in mathematics, a variety of names are in use. Sameness of cardinality is sometimes referred to as \"equipotence\", \"equipollence\", or \"equinumerosity\". It is thus said that two sets with the same cardinality are, respectively, \"equipotent\", \"equipollent\", or \"equinumerous\".\nFormal definition.\nFormally, assuming the axiom of choice, the cardinality of a set \"X\" is the least ordinal number \u03b1 such that there is a bijection between \"X\" and \u03b1. This definition is known as the von Neumann cardinal assignment. If the axiom of choice is not assumed, then a different approach is needed. The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set \"X\" (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and Principia Mathematica) is as the class [\"X\"] of all sets that are equinumerous with \"X\". This does not work in ZFC or other related systems of axiomatic set theory because if \"X\" is non-empty, this collection is too large to be a set. In fact, for \"X\" \u2260 \u2205 there is an injection from the universe into [\"X\"] by mapping a set \"m\" to {\"m\"} \u00d7 \"X\", and so by the axiom of limitation of size, [\"X\"] is a proper class. The definition does work however in type theory and in New Foundations and related systems. However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with \"X\" that have the least rank, then it will work (this is a trick due to Dana Scott: it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).\nFormally, the order among cardinal numbers is defined as follows: |\"X\"| \u2264 |\"Y\"| means that there exists an injective function from \"X\" to \"Y\". The Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schroeder theorem states that if |\"X\"| \u2264 |\"Y\"| and |\"Y\"| \u2264 |\"X\"| then |\"X\"| = |\"Y\"|. The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that given two sets \"X\" and \"Y\", either |\"X\"| \u2264 |\"Y\"| or |\"Y\"| \u2264 |\"X\"|.\nA set \"X\" is Dedekind-infinite if there exists a proper subset \"Y\" of \"X\" with |\"X\"| = |\"Y\"|, and Dedekind-finite if such a subset doesn't exist. The finite cardinals are just the natural numbers, in the sense that a set \"X\" is finite if and only if |\"X\"| = |\"n\"| = \"n\" for some natural number \"n\". Any other set is infinite.\nAssuming the axiom of choice, it can be proved that the Dedekind notions correspond to the standard ones. It can also be proved that the cardinal formula_3 (aleph null or aleph-0, where aleph is the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet, represented formula_1) of the set of natural numbers is the smallest infinite cardinal (i.e., any infinite set has a subset of cardinality formula_3). The next larger cardinal is denoted by formula_8, and so on. For every ordinal \u03b1, there is a cardinal number formula_13 and this list exhausts all infinite cardinal numbers.\nCardinal arithmetic.\nWe can define arithmetic operations on cardinal numbers that generalize the ordinary operations for natural numbers. It can be shown that for finite cardinals, these operations coincide with the usual operations for natural numbers. Furthermore, these operations share many properties with ordinary arithmetic.\nSuccessor cardinal.\nIf the axiom of choice holds, then every cardinal \u03ba has a successor, denoted \u03ba+, where \u03ba+ &gt; \u03ba and there are no cardinals between \u03ba and its successor. (Without the axiom of choice, using Hartogs' theorem, it can be shown that for any cardinal number \u03ba, there is a minimal cardinal \u03ba+ such that formula_14) For finite cardinals, the successor is simply \u03ba + 1. For infinite cardinals, the successor cardinal differs from the successor ordinal.\nCardinal addition.\nIf \"X\" and \"Y\" are disjoint, addition is given by the union of \"X\" and \"Y\". If the two sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by disjoint sets of the same cardinality (e.g., replace \"X\" by \"X\"\u00d7{0} and \"Y\" by \"Y\"\u00d7{1}).\nZero is an additive identity \"\u03ba\" + 0 = 0 + \"\u03ba\" = \"\u03ba\".\nAddition is associative (\"\u03ba\" + \"\u03bc\") + \"\u03bd\" = \"\u03ba\" + (\"\u03bc\" + \"\u03bd\").\nAddition is commutative \"\u03ba\" + \"\u03bc\" = \"\u03bc\" + \"\u03ba\".\nAddition is non-decreasing in both arguments:\nAssuming the axiom of choice, addition of infinite cardinal numbers is easy. If either \u03ba or \u03bc is infinite, then\nSubtraction.\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \u03c3 and a cardinal \u03bc, there exists a cardinal \u03ba such that \u03bc + \u03ba = \u03c3 if and only if \u03bc \u2264 \u03c3. It will be unique (and equal to \u03c3) if and only if \u03bc &lt; \u03c3.\nCardinal multiplication.\nThe product of cardinals comes from the Cartesian product.\n\"\u03ba\"\u00b70 = 0\u00b7\"\u03ba\" = 0.\n\"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\" = 0 \u2192 (\"\u03ba\" = 0 or \"\u03bc\" = 0).\nOne is a multiplicative identity \"\u03ba\"\u00b71 = 1\u00b7\"\u03ba\" = \"\u03ba\".\nMultiplication is associative (\"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\")\u00b7\"\u03bd\" = \"\u03ba\"\u00b7(\"\u03bc\"\u00b7\"\u03bd\").\nMultiplication is commutative \"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\" = \"\u03bc\"\u00b7\"\u03ba\".\nMultiplication is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n\"\u03ba\" \u2264 \"\u03bc\" \u2192 (\"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bd\" \u2264 \"\u03bc\"\u00b7\"\u03bd\" and \"\u03bd\"\u00b7\"\u03ba\" \u2264 \"\u03bd\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\").\nMultiplication distributes over addition:\n\"\u03ba\"\u00b7(\"\u03bc\" + \"\u03bd\") = \"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\" + \"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bd\" and\n(\"\u03bc\" + \"\u03bd\")\u00b7\"\u03ba\" = \"\u03bc\"\u00b7\"\u03ba\" + \"\u03bd\"\u00b7\"\u03ba\".\nAssuming the axiom of choice, multiplication of infinite cardinal numbers is also easy. If either \"\u03ba\" or \"\u03bc\" is infinite and both are non-zero, then\nDivision.\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \"\u03c0\" and a non-zero cardinal \u03bc, there exists a cardinal \u03ba such that \u03bc \u00b7 \u03ba = \"\u03c0\" if and only if \u03bc \u2264 \"\u03c0\". It will be unique (and equal to \"\u03c0\") if and only if \u03bc &lt; \"\u03c0\".\nCardinal exponentiation.\nExponentiation is given by\nwhere \"XY\" is the set of all functions from \"Y\" to \"X\".\nExponentiation is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n2|\"X\"| is the cardinality of the power set of the set \"X\" and Cantor's diagonal argument shows that 2|\"X\"| &gt; |\"X\"| for any set \"X\". This proves that no largest cardinal exists (because for any cardinal \"\u03ba\", we can always find a larger cardinal 2\u03ba). In fact, the class of cardinals is a proper class. (This proof fails in some set theories, notably New Foundations.)\nAll the remaining propositions in this section assume the axiom of choice:\nIf 2 \u2264 \u03ba and 1 \u2264 \u03bc and at least one of them is infinite, then:\nUsing K\u00f6nig's theorem, one can prove \u03ba &lt; \u03bacf(\u03ba) and \u03ba &lt; cf(2\u03ba) for any infinite cardinal \u03ba, where cf(\u03ba) is the cofinality of \u03ba.\nRoots.\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \u03ba and a finite cardinal \u03bc greater than 0, the cardinal \u03bd satisfying formula_21 will be formula_22.\nLogarithms.\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \u03ba and a finite cardinal \u03bc greater than 1, there may or may not be a cardinal \u03bb satisfying formula_23. However, if such a cardinal exists, it is infinite and less than \u03ba, and any finite cardinality \u03bd greater than 1 will also satisfy formula_24.\nThe logarithm of an infinite cardinal number \u03ba is defined as the least cardinal number \u03bc such that \u03ba \u2264 2\u03bc. Logarithms of infinite cardinals are useful in some fields of mathematics, for example in the study of cardinal invariants of topological spaces, though they lack some of the properties that logarithms of positive real numbers possess.\nThe continuum hypothesis.\nThe continuum hypothesis (CH) states that there are no cardinals strictly between formula_3 and formula_26 The latter cardinal number is also often denoted by formula_4; it is the cardinality of the continuum (the set of real numbers). In this case formula_28 The generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) states that for every infinite set \"X\", there are no cardinals strictly between |\u00a0\"X\"\u00a0| and 2|\u00a0\"X\"\u00a0|. The continuum hypothesis is independent of the usual axioms of set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms together with the axiom of choice (ZFC).\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography"}

For example, the set formula_1 contains 3 elements, and therefore formula_2 has a cardinality of 3. Beginning in the late 19th century, this concept was generalized to infinite sets, which allows one to distinguish between the different types of infinity, and to perform arithmetic on them. There are two approaches to cardinality: one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers.\nThe cardinality of a set is also called its size, when no confusion with other notions of size is possible.\nThe cardinality of a set formula_2 is usually denoted formula_4, with a vertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value, and the meaning depends on context. The cardinality of a set formula_2 may alternatively be denoted by formula_6, formula_2, formula_8, or formula_9.\nComparing sets.\nWhile the cardinality of a finite set is just the number of its elements, extending the notion to infinite sets usually starts with defining the notion of comparison of arbitrary sets (some of which are possibly infinite).\nDefinition 3: &lt;.\nIf \u2264 and \u2264 , then = (a fact known as Schr\u00f6der\u2013Bernstein theorem). The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that \u2264 or \u2264 for every \"A\", \"B\".\nCardinal numbers.\nIn the above section, \"cardinality\" of a set was defined functionally. In other words, it was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.\nThe relation of having the same cardinality is called equinumerosity, and this is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets. The equivalence class of a set \"A\" under this relation, then, consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as \"A\". There are two ways to define the \"cardinality of a set\":\nAssuming the axiom of choice, the cardinalities of the infinite sets are denoted\nFor each ordinal formula_11, formula_12 is the least cardinal number greater than formula_13.\nThe cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph-null (formula_14), while the cardinality of the real numbers is denoted by \"formula_15\" (a lowercase fraktur script \"c\"), and is also referred to as the cardinality of the continuum. Cantor showed, using the diagonal argument, that formula_16. We can show that formula_17, this also being the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers.\nThe continuum hypothesis says that formula_18, i.e. formula_19 is the smallest cardinal number bigger than formula_14, i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers. The continuum hypothesis is independent of ZFC, a standard axiomatization of set theory; that is, it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC\u2014provided that ZFC is consistent. For more detail, see \u00a7 Cardinality of the continuum below.\nFinite, countable and uncountable sets.\nIf the axiom of choice holds, the law of trichotomy holds for cardinality. Thus we can make the following definitions:\nInfinite sets.\nOur intuition gained from finite sets breaks down when dealing with infinite sets. In the late nineteenth century Georg Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others rejected the view that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. One example of this is Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel.\nIndeed, Dedekind defined an infinite set as one that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with a strict subset (that is, having the same size in Cantor's sense); this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite. Cantor introduced the cardinal numbers, and showed\u2014according to his bijection-based definition of size\u2014that some infinite sets are greater than others. The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers (formula_14).\nCardinality of the continuum.\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum (formula_24) is greater than that of the natural numbers (formula_14); that is, there are more real numbers R than natural numbers N. Namely, Cantor showed that formula_26 (see Beth one) satisfies:\nThe continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,\nHowever, this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted ZFC axiomatic set theory, if ZFC is consistent.\nCardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. These results are highly counterintuitive, because they imply that there exist proper subsets and proper supersets of an infinite set \"S\" that have the same size as \"S\", although \"S\" contains elements that do not belong to its subsets, and the supersets of \"S\" contain elements that are not included in it.\nThe first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (\u2212\u00bd\u03c0, \u00bd\u03c0) and R (see also Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel).\nThe second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in 1878, but it became more apparent in 1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite-dimensional space, but they can be used to obtain such a proof.\nCantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than formula_15 exist (see his generalized diagonal argument and theorem). They include, for instance:\nBoth have cardinality\nThe cardinal equalities formula_31 formula_32 and formula_33 can be demonstrated using cardinal arithmetic:\nUnion and intersection.\nIf \"A\" and \"B\" are disjoint sets, then\nFrom this, one can show that in general, the cardinalities of unions and intersections are related by the following equation:"}

DeMille", "text": "Cecil Blount DeMille (; August 12, 1881January 21, 1959) was an American film director and producer. Between 1914 and 1958, he made 70 features, both silent and sound films. He is acknowledged as a founding father of the American cinema and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. His silent films included social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants.\nDeMille was born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, and grew up in New York City. He began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved to writing and directing stage productions, some with Jesse Lasky, who was then a vaudeville producer. DeMille's first film, \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), was also the first full-length feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story made it commercially successful and it first publicized Hollywood as the home of the U.S. film industry. The continued success of his productions led to the founding of Paramount Pictures with Lasky and Adolph Zukor. His first biblical epic, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1923), was both a critical and commercial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for twenty-five years.\nDeMille directed \"The King of Kings\" (1927), a biography of Jesus, which gained approval for its sensitivity and reached more than 800\u00a0million viewers. \"The Sign of the Cross\" (1932) is said to be the first sound film to integrate all aspects of cinematic technique. \"Cleopatra\" (1934) was his first film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. After more than thirty years in film production, DeMille reached a pinnacle in his career with \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), a biblical epic which became the highest-grossing film of 1950. Along with biblical and historical narratives, he also directed films oriented toward \"neo-naturalism\", which tried to portray the laws of man fighting the forces of nature.\nHe received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director for his circus drama \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), which won both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. His last and best known film, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), also a Best Picture Academy Award nominee, is currently the eighth-highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. In addition to his Best Picture Awards, he received an Academy Honorary Award for his film contributions, the Palme d'Or (posthumously) for \"Union Pacific\" (1939), a DGA Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. He was the first recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, which was named in his honor. DeMille's reputation as a filmmaker has grown over time and his work has influenced many other films and directors.\nBiography.\n1881\u20131899: Early years.\nCecil Blount DeMille was born on August 12, 1881, in a boarding house on Main Street in Ashfield, Massachusetts, where his parents had been vacationing for the summer. On September 1, 1881, the family returned with newborn DeMille to their flat in New York. DeMille was named after his grandmothers Cecelia Wolff and Margarete Blount. He was the second of three children of Henry Churchill de Mille (September 4, 1853 \u2013 February 10, 1893) and his wife Matilda Beatrice deMille (n\u00e9e Samuel; January 30, 1853 \u2013 October 8, 1923), known as Beatrice. His brother, William C. DeMille, was born on July 25, 1878. Henry deMille, whose ancestors were of Dutch-Belgian descent, was a North Carolina-born dramatist, actor, and lay reader in the Episcopal Church. DeMille's father was also an English teacher at Columbia College (now Columbia University). He worked as a playwright, administrator, and faculty member during the early years of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, established in New York City in 1884.\nHenry deMille frequently collaborated with David Belasco when playwriting. Their most well known collaborations include \"The Wife\", \"Lord Chumley\", \"The Charity Ball\", and \"Men and Women\". DeMille's mother Beatrice, a literary agent and scriptwriter, whose parents were both of German Jewish heritage, married Henry deMille July 1, 1876, despite her parents' dissent due to their differing religions. She emigrated from England with her parents in 1871 when she was 18, and they settled in Brooklyn. Beatrice grew up in a middle-class English household. DeMille's parents met as members of a music and literary society in New York. Henry was a tall, red-headed student. Beatrice was intelligent, educated, forthright, and strong-willed. When they married, Beatrice converted to Episcopalianism.\nDeMille was a brave and confident child. He gained his love of theater while watching his father and Belasco rehearse their plays and a lasting memory for DeMille was a lunch with his father and actor Edwin Booth. As a child, DeMille created an alter-ego called \"Champion Driver\", a Robin Hood-like character, evidence of his creativity and imagination. The family lived in Washington, North Carolina, until Henry built a three-story Victorian-style house for his family in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey; they named this estate \"Pamlico\". John Philip Sousa was a friend of the family and DeMille recalled throwing mud balls in the air so neighbor Annie Oakley could practice her shooting. DeMille's sister Agnes was born on April 23, 1891; his mother nearly did not survive the birth. Agnes would die on February 11, 1894, at the age of three from spinal meningitis. DeMille's parents operated a private school in town and attended Christ Episcopal Church. DeMille recalled that this church was the place where he visualized the story of his 1923 version of \"The Ten Commandments\".\nOn January 8, 1893, at the age of forty, Henry de Mille died suddenly from typhoid fever, leaving Beatrice with three children. To provide for her family, she opened the Henry C. DeMille School for Girls in her home in February 1893. The aim of the school was to teach young women to properly understand and fulfill the women's duty to herself, her home, and her country. Before Henry deMille's death, Beatrice had \"enthusiastically supported\" her husband's theatrical aspirations. She later became the second female play broker on Broadway. On Henry DeMille's deathbed, he told his wife that he did not want his sons to become playwrights due to its uncertainty and disappointment as a career. In order to cultivate DeMille's education and life skills, DeMille's mother sent him to Pennsylvania Military College (now Widener University) in Chester, Pennsylvania, at the age of fifteen. He fled school to join the Spanish\u2013American War, but failed to meet the age requirement. DeMille was a neat, intelligent, athletic, and determined adolescent. At the military college, even though his grades were average, he reportedly excelled in personal conduct. DeMille (Class of 1900) attended and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he attended for free due to his father's service to the Academy. His graduation performance was the play \"The Arcady Trail\". In the audience was Charles Frohman who would cast DeMille in his play \"Hearts are Trumps\", DeMille's Broadway debut.\n1900\u20131912: Theater.\nCharles Frohman, Constance Adams, and David Belasco.\nCecil B. DeMille began his career as an actor on the stage in the theatrical company of Charles Frohman in 1900. He debuted as an actor on February 21, 1900, in the play \"Hearts Are Trumps\" at New York's Garden Theater. In 1901, DeMille starred in productions of \"A Repentance\", \"To Have and to Hold\", and \"Are You a Mason?\" At the age of twenty-one, Cecil B. DeMille married Constance Adams on August 16, 1902 at Adams's father's home in East Orange, New Jersey. The wedding party was small and Beatrice deMille's family was not in attendance. It was suggested by Simon Louvish that this was to conceal DeMille's Jewish heritage. Adams was 29 years old at the time of their marriage, eight years older than DeMille. They had met in a theater in Washington D.C. while they were both acting in \"Hearts Are Trumps\".\nTheir age difference led to their sexual incompatibility; according to DeMille, Adams was too \"pure\" to \"feel such violent and evil passions\". DeMille had more violent sexual preferences and fetishes than his wife and Adams allowed DeMille to have several long term mistresses during their marriage as an outlet for his particular sexual kinks, while maintaining an outward appearance of a faithful marriage. Adams did not want to have sexual relations with DeMille, but did not mind his affairs because she felt that sex and love were unrelated; she knew that she was the sole Mrs. DeMille. One of DeMille's affairs was with his screenwriter Jeanie MacPherson. Despite his reputation for extramarital affairs, DeMille did not like to have affairs with his stars, as he believed it would cause him to lose control as a director. He related a story that he maintained his self-control when Gloria Swanson sat on his lap, refusing to touch her.\nIn 1902, he played a small part in \"Hamlet\". Publicists wrote that he became an actor in order to learn how direct and produce, but DeMille admitted that he became an actor in order to pay the bills. \nFrom 1904 to 1905, DeMille attempted to make a living as a stock theatre actor with his wife Constance. DeMille made a 1905 reprise in \"Hamlet\" as Osric. In the summer of 1905 DeMille joined the stock cast at the Elitch Theatre in Denver, Colorado. He appeared in eleven of the fifteen plays presented that season, although all were minor roles. Maude Fealy would appear as the featured actress in several productions that summer and would develop a lasting friendship with DeMille. (He would later cast her in The Ten Commandments.) \nHis brother William was establishing himself as a playwright and sometimes invited him to collaborate. DeMille and William collaborated on \"The Genius\", \"The Royal Mounted\", and \"After Five\". However, none of these were very successful; William deMille was most successful when he worked alone. DeMille and his brother at times worked with the legendary impresario David Belasco, who had been a friend and collaborator of their father. DeMille would later adapt Belasco's \"The Girl of the Golden West\" and \"Rose of the Rancho\", and \"The Warrens of Virginia\" into films. DeMille was credited with creating the premise of Belasco's \"The Return of Peter Grimm\". \"The Return of Peter Grimm\" sparked controversy; however, because Belasco had taken DeMille's unnamed screenplay, changed the characters and named it \"The Return of Peter Grimm\", producing and presenting it as his own work. DeMille was credited in small print as \"based on an idea by Cecil DeMille\". The play was successful and DeMille was distraught that his childhood idol had plagiarized his work.\nLosing interest in theatre.\nDeMille performed on stage with actors whom he would later direct in films: Charlotte Walker, Mary Pickford, and Pedro de Cordoba. DeMille also produced and directed plays. His 1905 performance in \"The Prince Chap\" as the Earl of Huntington was well received by audiences. DeMille wrote a few of his own plays in-between stage performances, but his playwriting was not as successful. His first play was \"The Pretender-A Play in a Prologue and 4 Acts\" set in the seventeenth century Russia. Another unperformed play he wrote was \"Son of the Winds\", a mythological Native American story. Life was difficult for DeMille and his wife as traveling actors; however, traveling allowed him to experience part of the United States he had not yet seen. DeMille sometimes worked with the director E.H. Sothern, who influenced DeMille's later perfectionism in his work. In 1907, due to a scandal with one of Beatrice's students, Evelyn Nesbit, the Henry deMille School lost students. The school closed and Beatrice filed for bankruptcy. DeMille wrote another play originally called \"Sergeant Devil May Care\" which was renamed \"The Royal Mounted\". He also toured with the Standard Opera Company, but there are few records to indicate DeMille's singing ability. DeMille had a daughter, Cecilia, on November 5, 1908, who would be his only biological child. In the 1910s, DeMille began directing and producing other writer's plays.\nDeMille was poor and struggled to find work. Consequently, his mother hired him for her agency The DeMille Play Company and taught him how to be an agent and a playwright. Eventually, he became manager of the agency and later, a junior partner with his mother. In 1911, DeMille became acquainted with vaudeville producer Jesse Lasky when Lasky was searching for a writer for his new musical. He initially sought out William deMille. William had been a successful playwright, but DeMille was suffering from the failure of his plays \"The Royal Mounted\" and \"The Genius\". However, Beatrice introduced Lasky to DeMille instead. The collaboration of DeMille and Lasky produced a successful musical called \"California\" which opened in New York in January 1912. Another DeMille-Lasky production that opened in January 1912 was \"The Antique Girl\". DeMille found success in the spring of 1913 producing \"Reckless Age\" by Lee Wilson, a play about a high society girl wrongly accused of manslaughter starring Frederick Burton and Sydney Shields. However, changes in the theater rendered DeMille's melodramas obsolete before they were produced, and true theatrical success eluded him. He produced many flops. Having become disinterested in working in theatre, DeMille's passion for film was ignited when he watched the 1912 French film \"Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth\".\n1913\u20131914: Entering films.\nDesiring a change of scene, Cecil B. DeMille, Jesse Lasky, Sam Goldfish (later Samuel Goldwyn), and a group of East Coast businessmen created the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company in 1913 over which DeMille became director-general. Lasky and DeMille were said to have sketched out the organization of the company on the back of a restaurant menu. As director-general, DeMille's job was to make the films. In addition to directing, DeMille was the supervisor and consultant for the first year of films made by the Lasky Feature Play Company. Sometimes, he directed scenes for other directors at the Feature Play Company in order to release films on time. Moreover, when he was busy directing other films, he would co-author other Lasky Company scripts as well as create screen adaptations that others directed.\nThe Lasky Play Company sought out William DeMille to join the company, but he rejected the offer because he did not believe there was any promise in a film career. When William found out that DeMille had begun working in the motion picture industry, he wrote DeMille a letter, disappointed that he was willing \"to throw away [his] future\" when he was \"born and raised in the finest traditions of the theater\". The Lasky Company wanted to attract high-class audiences to their films so they began producing films from literary works. The Lasky Company bought the rights to the play \"The Squaw Man\" by Edwin Milton Royle and cast Dustin Farnum in the lead role. They offered Farnum a choice to have a quarter stock in the company (similar to William deMille) or $250 per week as salary. Farnum chose $250 per week. Already $15,000 in debt to Royle for the screenplay of \"The Squaw Man\", Lasky's relatives bought the $5,000 stock to save the Lasky Company from bankruptcy. With no knowledge of filmmaking, DeMille was introduced to observe the process at film studios. He was eventually introduced to Oscar Apfel, a stage director turned movie director.\nOn December 12, 1913, DeMille, his cast, and crew boarded a Southern Pacific train bound for Flagstaff via New Orleans. His tentative plan was to shoot a film in Arizona, but he felt that Arizona did not typify the Western look they were searching for. They also learned that other filmmakers were successfully shooting in Los Angeles, even in winter. He continued to Los Angeles. Once there, he chose not to shoot in Edendale, where many studios were, but in Hollywood. DeMille rented a barn to function as their film studio. Filming began on December 29, 1913, and lasted three weeks. Apfel filmed most of \"The Squaw Man\" due to DeMille's inexperience; however, DeMille learned quickly and was particularly adept at impromptu screenwriting as necessary. He made his first film run sixty minutes, as long as a short play. \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), co-directed by Oscar Apfel, was a sensation and it established the Lasky Company. This was the first feature-length film made in Hollywood. There were problems; however, with the perforation of the film stock and it was discovered the DeMille had brought a cheap British film projector. DeMille would later need to be sure to punch in sixty-five holes per foot instead of the industry-standard sixty-four. This was also the first American feature film; however, only by release date, as D. W. Griffith's \"Judith of Bethulia\" was filmed earlier than \"The Squaw Man\", but released later. Additionally, this was the only film in which DeMille shared director's credit with Oscar C. Apfel.\n\"The Squaw Man\" was a success, which led to the eventual founding of Paramount Pictures and Hollywood becoming the \"film capital of the world\". The film grossed over ten times its budget after its New York premiere in February 1914. DeMille's next project was to aid Oscar Apfel and directing \"Brewster's Millions\", which was wildly successful. In December 1914, Constance Adams brought home John DeMille, a fifteen-month-old, whom the couple legally adopted three years later. Biographer Scott Eyman suggested that this may have been a result of Adams's recent miscarriage.\n1915\u20131928: Silent era.\nWesterns, Paradise, and World War I.\nCecil B. DeMille's second film credited exclusively to him was \"The Virginian\". This is the earliest of DeMille's films available in a quality, color-tinted video format. However, this version is actually a 1918 re-release. The first few years of the Lasky Company were spent in making films nonstop, literally writing the language of film. DeMille himself directed twenty films by 1915. The most successful films during the beginning of the Lasky Company were \"Brewster's Millions\" (co-directed by DeMille), \"Rose of the Rancho\", and \"The Ghost Breaker\". DeMille adapted Belasco's dramatic lighting techniques to film technology, mimicking moonlight with U.S. cinema's first attempts at \"motivated lighting\" in \"The Warrens of Virginia\". This was the first of few film collaborations with his brother William. They struggled to adapt the play from the stage to the set. After the film was shown, viewers complained that the shadows and lighting prevented the audience from seeing the actors' full faces, complaining that they would only pay half price. However, Sam Goldwyn realized that if they called it \"Rembrandt\" lighting, the audience would pay double the price. Additionally, because of DeMille's cordiality after the \"Peter Grimm\" incident, DeMille was able to rekindle his partnership with Belasco. He adapted several of Belasco's screenplays into film.\nDeMille's most successful film was \"The Cheat\"; DeMille's direction in the film was acclaimed. In 1916, exhausted from three years of nonstop filmmaking, DeMille purchased land in the Angeles National Forest for a ranch which would become his getaway. He called this place, \"Paradise\", declaring it a wildlife sanctuary; no shooting of animals was allowed besides snakes. His wife did not like Paradise, so DeMille often brought his mistresses there with him including actress Julia Faye. In addition to his Paradise, DeMille purchased a yacht in 1921 which he called \"The Seaward\".\nWhile filming \"The Captive\" in 1915, an extra, Bob Fleming, died on set when another extra failed to heed to DeMille's orders to unload all guns for rehearsal. DeMille instructed the guilty man to leave town and would never reveal his name. Lasky and DeMille maintained the widow Fleming on the payroll; however, according to leading actor House Peters Sr. DeMille refused to stop production for the funeral of Fleming. Peters claimed that he encouraged the cast to attend the funeral with him anyway since DeMille would not be able to shoot the film without him. On July 19, 1916, the Jesse Lasky Feature Play Company merged with Adolph Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, becoming Famous Players-Lasky. Zukor became president with Lasky as the vice president. DeMille was maintained as director-general and Goldwyn became chairman of the board. Goldwyn was later fired from Famous Players-Lasky due to frequent clashes with Lasky, DeMille, and finally Zukor. While on a European vacation in 1921, DeMille contracted rheumatic fever in Paris. He was confined to bed and unable to eat. His poor physical condition upon his return home affected the production of his 1922 film \"Manslaughter\". According to Richard Birchard, DeMille's weakened state during production may have led to the film being received as uncharacteristically substandard.\nDuring World War I, the Famous Players-Lasky organized a military company underneath the National Guard called the \"Home Guard\" made up of film studio employees with DeMille as captain. Eventually, the Guard was promoted to a battalion and recruited soldiers from other film studios. They took time off weekly from film production to practice military drills. Additionally, during the war, DeMille volunteered for the Justice Department's Intelligence Office, investigating friends, neighbors, and others he came in contact with in connection with the Famous Players-Lasky. He volunteered for the Intelligence Office during World War II as well. Although DeMille considered enlisting in World War I, he stayed in the United States and made films. However, he did take a few months to set up a movie theater for the French front. Famous Players-Lasky donated the films. DeMille and Adams adopted Katherine Lester in 1920 whom Adams had found in the orphanage over which she was the director. In 1922, the couple adopted Richard deMille.\nScandalous dramas, Biblical epics, and departure from Paramount.\nFilm started becoming more sophisticated and the subsequent films of the Lasky company were criticized for primitive and unrealistic set design. Consequently, Beatrice deMille introduced the Famous Players-Lasky to Wilfred Buckland, who DeMille had known from his time at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and he became DeMille's art director. William deMille reluctantly became a story editor. William deMille would later convert from theater to Hollywood and would spend the rest of his career as a film director. Throughout his career, DeMille would frequently remake his own films. In his first instance, in 1917, he remade \"The Squaw Man\" (1918), only waiting four years from the 1914 original. Despite its quick turnaround, the film was fairly successful. However, DeMille's second remake at MGM in 1931 would be a failure.\nAfter five years and thirty hit films, DeMille became the American film industry's most successful director. In the silent era, he was renowned for \"Male and Female\" (1919), \"Manslaughter\" (1922), \"The Volga Boatman\" (1926), and \"The Godless Girl\" (1928). DeMille's trademark scenes included bathtubs, lion attacks, and Roman orgies. Many of his films featured scenes in two-color Technicolor. In 1923, DeMille released a modern melodrama \"The Ten Commandments\" which was a significant change from his previous stint of irreligious films. The film was produced on a large budget of $600,000, the most expensive production at Paramount. This concerned the executives at Paramount; however, the film turned out to be the studio's highest-grossing film. It held the Paramount record for twenty-five years until DeMille broke the record again himself.\nIn the early 1920s, scandal surrounded Paramount. Several Paramount contractees were accused of rape, murder, and drug addiction. Outcry intensified from religious groups and the media were appalled by immorality in the film industry on and off screen. A censorship board called the Hays Code was established. DeMille's depiction of on screen immorality came under fire, likely due to the scandalous film \"The Affairs of Anatol\". Furthermore, DeMille argued with Zukor over his extravagant and over-budget production costs. Consequently, DeMille left Paramount in 1924 despite having helped establish it. Instead, he joined the Producers Distributing Corporation.\nHis first film from his new production company, DeMille Pictures Corporation, was \"The Road to Yesterday\" in 1925. He directed and produced four films on his own, working with Producers Distributing Corporation because he found front office supervision too restricting. Aside from \"The King of Kings\" (which was said to be DeMille's favorite film), none of DeMille's films away from Paramount were successful. \"The King of Kings\" established DeMille as \"master of the grandiose and of biblical sagas\". The most successful Christian film of the silent era. DeMille calculated that the film had been viewed over 800\u00a0million times around the world. After the release of DeMille's \"The Godless Girl\", silent films in America became obsolete and DeMille was forced to shoot a shoddy final reel with the new sound production technique. Although this final reel looked so different from the previous eleven reels that it appeared to be from another movie, according to Simon Louvish, the film is one of DeMille's strangest and most \"DeMillean\" film.\nThe immense popularity of DeMille's silent films enabled him to branch out into other areas. The Roaring Twenties were the boom years and DeMille took full advantage, opening the Mercury Aviation Company, one of America's first commercial airlines. He was also a real estate speculator, an underwriter of political campaigns, and vice president of Bank of America. He was additionally vice president of the Commercial National Trust and Savings Bank in Los Angeles where he approved loans for other filmmakers. In 1916, DeMille purchased a mansion in Hollywood. Charlie Chaplin lived next door for a time, and after he moved, DeMille purchased the other house and combined the estates.\n1929\u20131956: Sound era.\nMGM and return to Paramount.\nWhen \"talking pictures\" were invented in 1928, Cecil B. DeMille made a successful transition, offering his own innovations to the painful process; he devised a microphone boom and a soundproof camera blimp. He also popularized the camera crane. His first three sound films were produced at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. These three films, \"Dynamite\", \"Madame Satan\", and his 1931 remake of \"The Squaw Man\" were both critically and financially unsuccessful. He had completely adapted to the production of sound film besides despite the film's poor dialogue. After his contract ended at MGM, he left, but no production studios would hire him. He attempted to create a guild of a half a dozen directors with the same creative desires called the Director's Guild. However, the idea failed due to lack of funding and commitment. Moreover, DeMille was audited by the Internal Revenue Service due to issues with his production company. This was, according to DeMille, the lowest point of his career. DeMille traveled abroad to find employment until he was offered a deal at Paramount.\nIn 1932, DeMille returned to Paramount at the request of Lasky, bringing with him his own production unit. His first film back at Paramount, \"The Sign of the Cross\", was also his first success since leaving Paramount besides \"The King of Kings\". DeMille's return was approved by Zukor under the condition that DeMille not exceed his production budget of $650,000 for \"The Sign of the Cross\". Produced in eight weeks without exceeding budget, the film was financially successful. \"The Sign of the Cross\" was the first film to integrate all cinematic techniques. The film was considered a \"masterpiece\" and surpassed the quality of other sound films of the time. DeMille followed this epic uncharacteristically with two dramas released in 1933 and 1934. \"This Day and Age\" and \"Four Frightened People\" were box office disappointments, though \"Four Frightened People\" received good reviews. DeMille would stick to his large-budget spectaculars for the rest of his career.\nPolitics and Lux Radio Theatre.\nCecil B. DeMille was a conservative Republican activist. He became more conservative as he aged, DeMille lived a life of strong Christian ethics, as exemplified through his wife and children. On the other hand, DeMille's private life, which included mistresses and adultery, conflicted with the Episcopalian integrity he portrayed. Additionally, he frequently contradicted his staunchly conservative viewpoints. His film \"The Volga Boatman\" gave a sympathetic portrayal of the Russian Revolution and he was fascinated by a trip to the Soviet Union in the 1930s. More in line with his conservative views, he was known as anti-union and worked to prevent unionizing of film production studios. However, according to DeMille himself, he was not anti-union and belonged to a few unions himself. He said he was rather against union leaders such as Walter Reuther and Harry Bridges whom he compared to dictators. He supported Herbert Hoover and in 1928 made his largest campaign donation to Hoover. However, in a contradiction, DeMille liked Franklin D. Roosevelt, finding him charismatic, tenacious, and intelligent. He agreed with Roosevelt's abhorrence of Prohibition. DeMille lent Roosevelt a car for his campaign for the 1932 United States presidential election and voted for him. However, he would never again vote for a Democratic candidate in a presidential election.\nFrom June 1, 1936, until January 22, 1945, Cecil B. DeMille hosted and directed \"Lux Radio Theater\", a weekly digest of current feature films. Broadcast on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) from 1935 to 1954, the Lux Radio show was one of the most popular weekly shows in the history of radio. While DeMille was host, the show had forty million weekly listeners, gaining DeMille an annual salary of $100,000. From 1936 to 1945, he produced, hosted, and directed all shows with the occasional exception of a guest director. He resigned from the Lux Radio Show because he refused to pay a dollar to the American Federation of Radio Artists (AFRA) because he did not believe that any organization had the right to \"levy a compulsory assessment upon any member.\" Consequently, he had to resign from the radio show.\nDeMille sued the union for reinstatement but lost. He then appealed to the California Supreme Court and lost again. When the AFRA expanded to television, DeMille was banned from television appearances. Consequently, he formed the DeMille Foundation for Political Freedom in order to campaign for the right to work. He began presenting speeches across the United States for the next few years. DeMille's primary criticism was of closed shops, but later included criticism of communism and unions in general. The United States Supreme Court declined to review his case. Despite his loss, DeMille continued to lobby for the Taft\u2013Hartley Act, which passed. This prohibited denying anyone the right to work if they refuse to pay a political assessment, however, the law did not apply retroactively. Consequently, DeMille's television and radio appearance ban lasted for the remainder of his life, though he was permitted to appear on radio or television to publicize a movie. William Keighley was his replacement. DeMille would never again work on radio. \nAdventure films and dramatic spectacles.\nIn 1939, DeMille's \"Union Pacific\" was successful through DeMille's collaboration with the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific gave DeMille access to historical data, early period trains, and expert crews, adding to the authenticity of the film. During pre-production of \"Union Pacific\", DeMille was dealing with his first serious health issue. In March 1938, He underwent a major emergency prostatectomy. He suffered from a post-surgery infection from which he nearly did not recover, citing streptomycin as his saving grace. The surgery caused him to suffer from sexual dysfunction for the rest of his life, according to some family members. Following his surgery and the success of \"Union Pacific\", in 1940, DeMille first used three-strip Technicolor in \"North West Mounted Police\". DeMille wanted to film in Canada; however, due to budget constraints, the film was instead shot in Oregon and Hollywood. Critics were impressed with the visuals but found the scripts dull, calling it DeMille's \"poorest Western\". Despite the criticism, it was Paramount's highest-grossing film of the year. Audiences liked its highly saturated color, so DeMille made no further black-and-white features. DeMille was anti-communist and abandoned a project in 1940 to film Ernest Hemingway's \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" due to its communist themes despite the fact he had already paid $100,000 for the rights to the novel. He was so eager to produce the film, that he hadn't yet read the novel. He claimed he abandoned the project in order to complete a different project, but in reality, it was to preserve his reputation and avoid appearing reactionary. While concurrently filmmaking, he served in World War II at the age of sixty as his neighborhood air-raid warden.\nIn 1942, DeMille worked with Jeanie MacPherson and brother William deMille in order to produce a film called \"Queen of Queens\" which was intended to be about Mary, mother of Jesus. After reading the screenplay, Daniel A. Lord warned DeMille that Catholics would find the film too irreverent, while non-Catholics would have considered the film Catholic propaganda. Consequently, the film was never made. Jeanie MacPherson would work as a scriptwriter for many of DeMille's films. In 1938, DeMille supervised the compilation of film \"Land of Liberty\" to represent the contribution of the American film industry to the 1939 New York World's Fair. DeMille used clips from his own films in \"Land of Liberty\". Though the film was not high-grossing, it was well-received and DeMille was asked to shorten its running time to allow for more showings per day. MGM distributed the film in 1941 and donated profits to World War II relief charities.\nIn 1942, DeMille released Paramount's most successful film, \"Reap the Wild Wind\". It was produced with a large budget and contained many special effects including an electronically operated giant squid. After working on \"Reap the Wild Wind\", in 1944, he was the master of ceremonies at the massive rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey\u2013Bricker ticket as well as Governor Earl Warren of California. DeMille's subsequent film \"Unconquered\" (1947) had the longest running time (146 minutes), longest filming schedule (102 days) and largest budget of $5\u00a0million. The sets and effects were so realistic that 30 extras needed to be hospitalized due to a scene with fireballs and flaming arrows. It was commercially very successful.\nDeMille's next film, \"Samson and Delilah\" in 1949, became Paramount's highest-grossing film up to that time. A Biblical epic with sex, it was a characteristically DeMille film. Again, 1952's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" became Paramount's highest-grossing film to that point. Furthermore, DeMille's film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Academy Award for Best Story. The film began production in 1949, Ringling Brothers-Barnum and Bailey were paid $250,000 for use of the title and facilities. DeMille toured with the circus while helping write the script. Noisy and bright, it was not well-liked by critics, but was a favorite among audiences. DeMille signed a contract with Prentice Hall publishers in August 1953 to publish an autobiography. DeMille would reminisce into a voice recorder, the recording would be transcribed, and the information would be organized in the biography based on the topic. Art Arthur also interviewed people for the autobiography. DeMille did not like the first draft of the biography, saying that he thought the person portrayed in the biography was an \"SOB\"; he said it made him sound too egotistical. Besides filmmaking and finishing his autobiography, DeMille was involved in other projects. In the early 1950s, DeMille was recruited by Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner to serve on the board of the anti-communist National Committee for a Free Europe, the public face of the organization that oversaw the Radio Free Europe service. In 1954, Secretary of the Air Force Harold E. Talbott asked DeMille for help in designing the cadet uniforms at the newly established United States Air Force Academy. DeMille's designs, most notably his design of the distinctive cadet parade uniform, won praise from Air Force and Academy leadership, were ultimately adopted, and are still worn by cadets.\nFinal works and unrealized projects.\nIn 1952, DeMille sought approval for a lavish remake of his 1923 silent film \"The Ten Commandments\". He went before the Paramount board of directors, which was mostly Jewish-American. The members rejected his proposal, even though his last two films, \"Samson and Delilah\" and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", had been record-breaking hits. Adolph Zukor convinced the board to change their minds on the grounds of morality. DeMille did not have an exact budget proposal for the project, and it promised to be the most costly in U.S. film history. Still, the members unanimously approved it. \"The Ten Commandments\", released in 1956, was DeMille's final film. It was the longest (3 hours, 39 minutes) and most expensive ($13\u00a0million) film in Paramount history. Production of \"The Ten Commandments\" began in October 1954. The Exodus scene was filmed on-site in Egypt with the use of four Technicolor-VistaVision camera filming 12,000 people. They continued filming in 1955 in Paris and Hollywood on 30 different sound stages. They were even required to expand to RKO sound studios for filming. Post-production lasted a year and the film premiered in Salt Lake City. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, it grossed over $80\u00a0million, which surpassed the gross of \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" and every other film in history, except for \"Gone with the Wind\". A unique practice at the time, DeMille offered ten percent of his profit to the crew.\nOn November 7, 1954, while in Egypt filming the Exodus sequence for \"The Ten Commandments\", DeMille (who was seventy-three) climbed a ladder to the top of the massive Per Rameses set and suffered a serious heart attack. Despite the urging of his associate producer, DeMille wanted to return to the set right away. DeMille developed a plan with his doctor to allow him to continue directing while reducing his physical stress. Although DeMille completed the film, his health was diminished by several more heart attacks. His daughter Cecilia took over as director as DeMille sat behind the camera with Loyal Griggs as the cinematographer. This film would be his last. \nDue to his frequent heart attacks, DeMille asked his son-in-law, actor Anthony Quinn, to direct a remake of his 1938 film \"The Buccaneer\". DeMille served as executive producer, overseeing producer Henry Wilcoxon. Despite a cast led by Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner, the 1958 film \"The Buccaneer\" was a disappointment. DeMille attended the Santa Barbara premiere of \"The Buccaneer\" in December 1958. DeMille was unable to attend the Los Angeles premiere of \"The Buccaneer\". In the months before his death, DeMille was researching a film biography of Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement. DeMille asked David Niven to star in the film, but it was never made. DeMille also was planning a film about the space race as well as another biblical epic about the Book of Revelation. DeMille's autobiography was mostly completed by the time DeMille died and was published in November 1959.\nDeath.\n Cecil B. DeMille suffered a series of heart attacks from June 1958 to January 1959, and died on January 21, 1959, following an attack. DeMille's funeral was held on January 23 at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. He was entombed at the Hollywood Memorial Cemetery (now known as Hollywood Forever). After his death, notable news outlets such as \"The New York Times\", \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Guardian\" honored DeMille as \"pioneer of movies\", \"the greatest creator and showman of our industry\", and \"the founder of Hollywood\". DeMille left his multi-million dollar estate in Los Feliz, Los Angeles in Laughlin Park to his daughter Cecilia because his wife had dementia and was unable to care for an estate. She would die one year later. His personal will drew a line between Cecilia and his three adopted children, with Cecilia receiving a majority of DeMille's inheritance and estate. The other three children were surprised by this, as DeMille did not treat the children differently in life. Cecilia lived in the house for many years but auctioned the house in the late 1980s.\nFilmmaking.\nInfluences.\nDeMille believed his first influences to be his parents, Henry and Beatrice DeMille. His playwright father introduced him to the theater at a young age. Henry was heavily influenced by the work of Charles Kingsley whose ideas trickled down to DeMille. DeMille noted that his mother had a \"high sense of the dramatic\" and was determined to continue the artistic legacy of her husband after he died. Beatrice became a play broker and author's agent, influencing DeMille's early life and career. DeMille's father worked with David Belasco theatrical producer, impresario, and playwright. Belasco was known for adding realistic elements in his plays such as real flowers, food, and aromas that could transport his audiences into the scenes. While working in theatre, DeMille used real fruit trees in his play \"California\" as influenced by Belasco. Similar to Belasco, DeMille's theatre was revolved around entertainment, rather than artistry. Generally, Belasco's influence of DeMille's career can be seen in DeMille's showmanship and narration. E.H. Sothern's early influence on DeMille's work can be seen in DeMille's perfectionism. DeMille recalled that one of the most influential plays he saw was \"Hamlet\", directed by Sothern.\nMethod.\nDeMille's filmmaking process always began with extensive research. Next, he would work with writers to develop the story that he was envisioning. Then, he would help writers construct a script. Finally, he would leave the script with artists and allow them to create artistic depictions and renderings of each scene. Plot and dialogue was not a strong point of DeMille's films. Consequently, he focused his efforts on his films' visuals. He worked with visual technicians, editors, art directors, costume designers, cinematographers, and set carpenters in order to perfect the visual aspects of his films. With his editor, Anne Bauchens, DeMille used editing techniques to allow the visual images to bring the plot to climax rather than dialogue. DeMille had large and frequent office conferences to discuss and examine all aspects of the working film including story-boards, props, and special effects.\nDeMille rarely gave direction to actors; he preferred to \"office-direct\" where he would work with actors in his office, going over characters and reading through scripts. Any problems on the set were often fixed by writers in the office rather than on the set. DeMille did not believe a large movie set was the place to discuss minor character or line issues. DeMille was particularly adept at directing and managing large crowds in his films. Martin Scorsese recalled that DeMille had the skill to maintain control of not only the lead actors in a frame but the many extras in the frame as well. DeMille was adept at directing \"thousands of extras\", and many of his pictures include spectacular set pieces: the toppling of the pagan temple in \"Samson and Delilah\"; train wrecks in \"The Road to Yesterday\", \"Union Pacific\" and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\"; the destruction of an airship in \"Madam Satan\"; and the parting of the Red Sea in both versions of \"The Ten Commandments\".\nDeMille experimented in his early films with photographic light and shade which created dramatic shadows instead of glare. His specific use of lighting, influenced by his mentor David Belasco, was for the purpose of creating \"striking images\" and heightening \"dramatic situations\". DeMille was unique in using this technique. In addition to his use of volatile and abrupt film editing, his lighting and composition were innovative for the time period as filmmakers were primarily concerned with a clear, realistic image. Another important aspect of DeMille's editing technique was to put the film away for a week or two after an initial edit in order to re-edit the picture with a fresh mind. This allowed for the rapid production of his films in the early years of the Lasky Company. The cuts were sometimes rough, but the movies were always interesting.\nDeMille often edited in a manner that favored psychological space rather than physical space through his cuts. In this way, the characters' thoughts and desires are the visual focus rather than the circumstances regarding the physical scene. As DeMille's career progressed, he increasingly relied on artist Dan Sayre Groesbeck's concept, costume, and storyboard art. Groesbeck's art was circulated on set to give actors and crew members a better understanding of DeMille's vision. His art was even shown at Paramount meetings when pitching new films. DeMille adored the art of Groesbeck, even hanging it above his fireplace, but film staff found it difficult to convert his art into three-dimensional sets. As DeMille continued to rely on Groesbeck, the nervous energy of his early films transformed into more steady compositions of his later films. While visually appealing, this made the films appear more old-fashioned.\nComposer Elmer Bernstein described DeMille as, \"sparing no effort\", when filmmaking. Bernstein recalled that DeMille would scream, yell, or flatter, whatever it took to achieve the perfection he required in his films. DeMille was painstakingly attentive to details on set and was as critical of himself as he was of his crew. Costume designer Dorothy Jeakins, who worked with DeMille on \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), described that DeMille was skilled in humiliating people. Jeakins admitted that she received quality training from DeMille, but that it was necessary to become a perfectionist on a DeMille set to avoid being fired. DeMille had an authoritarian persona on set; he required absolute attention from the cast and crew. He had a band of assistants who catered to his needs. He would speak to the entire set, sometimes enormous with countless numbers of crew members and extras, via a microphone to maintain control of the set. He was disliked by many inside and outside of the film industry due to his cold and controlling reputation.\nDeMille was known for autocratic behavior on the set, singling out and berating extras who were not paying attention. Many of these displays were thought to be staged, however, as an exercise in discipline. He despised actors who were unwilling to take physical risks, especially when he had first demonstrated that the required stunt would not harm them. This occurred with Victor Mature in \"Samson and Delilah\". Mature refused to wrestle Jackie the Lion, even though DeMille had just tussled with the lion, proving that he was tame. DeMille told the actor that he was \"one hundred percent yellow\". Paulette Goddard's refusal to risk personal injury in a scene involving fire in \"Unconquered\" cost her DeMille's favor and a role in \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". DeMille did receive help in his films, notably from Alvin Wyckoff who shot forty-three of DeMille's films; brother William deMille who would occasionally serve as his screenwriter; and Jeanie Macpherson, who served as DeMille's exclusive screenwriter for fifteen years; and Eddie Salven, DeMille's favorite assistant director.\nDeMille made stars of unknown actors: Gloria Swanson, Bebe Daniels, Rod La Rocque, William Boyd, Claudette Colbert, and Charlton Heston. He also cast established stars such as Gary Cooper, Robert Preston, Paulette Goddard and Fredric March in multiple pictures. DeMille displayed a loyalty to his performers, casting them repeatedly including: Henry Wilcoxon, Julia Faye, Joseph Schildkraut, Ian Keith, Charles Bickford, Theodore Roberts, Akim Tamiroff and William Boyd. DeMille was credited by actor Edward G. Robinson with saving his career following his eclipse in the Hollywood blacklist.\nStyle and themes.\nCecil B. DeMille's film production career evolved from critically significant silent films to financially significant sound films. He began his career with reserved yet brilliant melodramas. From there, DeMille's style developed into marital comedies with outrageously melodramatic plots. In order to attract a high-class audience, DeMille based many of his early films on stage melodramas, novels, and short stories. He began the production of epics earlier in his career until they began to solidify his career in the 1920s. By 1930, DeMille had perfected his film style of mass-interest spectacle films with Western, Roman, or Biblical themes. DeMille was often criticized for making his spectacles too colorful and for being too occupied with entertaining the audience rather than accessing the artistic and auteur possibilities that film could provide. However, others interpreted DeMille's work as visually impressive, thrilling, and nostalgic. Along the same lines, critics of DeMille often qualify him by his later spectacles and fail to consider several decades of ingenuity and energy that defined him during his generation. Throughout his career, he did not alter his films to better adhere to contemporary or popular styles. Actor Charlton Heston admitted DeMille was, \"terribly unfashionable\" and Sidney Lumet called Demille, \"the cheap version of D.W. Griffith,\" adding that DeMille, \"[didn't have]...an original thought in his head,\" though Heston added that DeMille was much more than that.\nAccording to Scott Eyman, DeMille's films were at the same time masculine and feminine due to his thematic adventurousness and his eye for the extravagant. DeMille's distinctive style can be seen through camera and lighting effects as early as \"The Squaw Man\" with the use of daydream images; moonlight and sunset on a mountain; and side-lighting through a tent flap. In the early age of cinema, DeMille differentiated the Lasky Company from other production companies due to the use of dramatic, low-key lighting they called \"Lasky lighting\" and marketed as \"Rembrandt lighting\" to appeal to the public. DeMille achieved international recognition for his unique use of lighting and color tint in his film \"The Cheat\". DeMille's 1956 version of \"The Ten Commandments\", according to director Martin Scorsese, is renowned for its level of production and the care and detail that went into creating the film. He stated that \"The Ten Commandments\" was the final culmination of DeMille's style.\nDeMille was interested in art and his favorite artist was Gustave Dor\u00e9; DeMille based some of his most well-known scenes on the work of Dor\u00e9. DeMille was the first director to connect art to filmmaking; he created the title of \"art director\" on the film set. DeMille was also known for his use of special effects without the use of digital technology. Notably, DeMille had cinematographer John P. Fulton create the parting of the Red Sea scene in his 1956 film \"The Ten Commandments\", which was one of the most expensive special effects in film history, and has been called by Steven Spielberg \"the greatest special effect in film history\". The actual parting of the sea was created by releasing 360,000 gallons of water into a huge water tank split by a U-shaped trough, overlaying it with film of a giant waterfall that was built on the Paramount backlot, and playing the clip backwards.\nAside from his Biblical and historical epics which are concerned with how man relates to God, some of DeMille's films contained themes of \"neo-naturalism\" which portray the conflict between the laws of man and the laws of nature. Although he is known for his later \"spectacular\" films, his early films are held in high regard by critics and film historians. DeMille discovered the possibilities of the \"bathroom\" or \"boudoir\" in film without being \"vulgar\" or \"cheap\". DeMille's films \"Male and Female\", \"Why Change Your Wife?\", and \"The Affairs of Anatol\" can be retrospectively described as high camp and are categorized as \"early DeMille films\" due to their particular style of production and costume and set design. However, his earlier films \"The Captive\", \"Kindling\", \"Carmen\", and \"The Whispering Chorus\" are more serious films. It is difficult to typify DeMille's films into one specific genre. His first three films were Westerns, and he filmed many Westerns throughout his career. However, throughout his career, he filmed comedies, periodic and contemporary romances, dramas, fantasies, propaganda, Biblical spectacles, musical comedies, suspense, and war films. At least one DeMille film can represent each film genre. DeMille produced the majority of his films before the 1930s, and by the time sound films were invented, film critics saw DeMille as antiquated, with his best filmmaking years behind him.\nDeMille's films contained many similar themes throughout his career. However, the films of his silent era were often thematically different than the films of his sound era. His silent era films often included the \"battle of the sexes\" theme due to the era of women's suffrage and the enlarging role of women in society. Moreover, before his religious-themed films, many of his silent era films revolved around \"husband-and-wife-divorce-and-remarry satires\", considerably more adult-themed. According to Simon Louvish, these films reflected DeMille's inner thoughts and opinions about marriage and human sexuality. Religion was a theme that DeMille returned to throughout his career. Of his seventy films, five revolved around stories of the Bible and the New Testament; however many others, while not direct retellings of Biblical stories, had themes of faith and religious fanaticism in films such as \"The Crusades\" and \"The Road to Yesterday\". Western and frontier American were also themes that DeMille returned to throughout his career. His first several films were westerns and he produced a chain of westerns during the sound era. Instead of portraying the danger and anarchy of the West, he portrayed the opportunity and redemption found in Western America. Another common theme in DeMille's films is the reversal of fortune and the portrayal of the rich and the poor, including the war of the classes and man versus society conflicts such as in \"The Golden Chance\" and \"The Cheat\". In relation to his own interests and sexual preferences, sadomasochism was a minor theme present in some of his films. Another minor characteristic of DeMille's films include train crashes which can be found in several of his films.\nLegacy.\nKnown as the father of the Hollywood motion picture industry, Cecil B. DeMille made 70 films including several box-office hits. DeMille is one of the more commercially successful film directors in history with his films before the release of \"The Ten Commandments\" estimated to have grossed $650\u00a0million worldwide. Adjusted for inflation, DeMille's remake of \"The Ten Commandments\" is the eighth highest-grossing film in the world.\nAccording to Sam Goldwyn, critics did not like DeMille's films, but the audiences did and \"they have the final word\". Similarly, scholar David Blanke, argued that DeMille had lost the respect of his colleagues and film critics by his late film career. However, his final films maintained that DeMille was still respected by his audiences. Five of DeMille's film were the highest-grossing films at the year of their release, with only Spielberg topping him with six of his films as the highest-grossing films of the year. DeMille's highest-grossing films include: \"The Sign of the Cross\" (1932), \"Unconquered\" (1947), \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), and \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956). Director Ridley Scott has been called \"the Cecil B. DeMille of the digital era\" due to his classical and medieval epics.\nDespite his box-office success, awards, and artistic achievements, DeMille has been dismissed and ignored by critics both during his life and posthumously. He consistently was criticized for producing shallow films without talent or artistic care. Compared to other directors, few film scholars have taken the time to academically analyze his films and style. During the French New Wave, critics began to categorize certain filmmakers as auteurs such as Howard Hawks, John Ford, and Raoul Walsh. DeMille was left off the list, determined to be too unsophisticated and antiquated to be considered an auteur. However, Simon Louvish wrote \"he was the complete master and auteur of his films\" and Anton Kozlovic called him the \"unsung American auteur\". Andrew Sarris, a leading proponent of the auteur theory, ranked DeMille highly as an auteur in the \"Far Side of Paradise\", just below the \"Pantheon\". Sarris added that despite the influence of styles of contemporary directors throughout his career, DeMille's style remained unchanged. Robert Birchard wrote one could argue auteurship of DeMille on the basis that DeMille's thematic and visual style remained consistent throughout his career. However, Birchard acknowledged that Sarris's point was more likely that DeMille's style was behind the development of film as an art form. Meanwhile, Sumiko Higashi sees DeMille as \"not only a figure who was shaped and influenced by the forces of his era but as a filmmaker who left his own signature on the culture industry.\" The critic Camille Paglia has called \"The Ten Commandments\" one of the ten greatest films of all time.\nDeMille was one of the first directors to become a celebrity in his own right. He cultivated the image of the omnipotent director, complete with megaphone, riding crop, and jodhpurs. He was known for his unique, working wardrobe which included riding boots, riding pants, and soft, open necked shirts. Joseph Henabery recalled that DeMille looked like \"a king on a throne surrounded by his court\" while directing films on a camera platform.\nDeMille was respected by his peers, yet his individual films were sometimes criticized. \"Directorially, I think his pictures were the most horrible things I've ever seen in my life\", said director William Wellman. \"But he put on pictures that made a fortune. In that respect, he was better than any of us\", Wellman added. Producer David O. Selznick wrote: \"There has appeared only one Cecil B. DeMille. He is one of the most extraordinarily able showmen of modern times. However much I may dislike some of his pictures, it would be very silly of me, as a producer of commercial motion pictures, to demean for an instant his unparalleled skill as a maker of mass entertainment.\" Salvador Dal\u00ed wrote that DeMille, Walt Disney and the Marx Brothers were \"the three great American Surrealists\". DeMille appeared as himself in numerous films, including the MGM comedy \"Free and Easy\". He often appeared in his coming-attraction trailers and narrated many of his later films, even stepping on screen to introduce \"The Ten Commandments\". DeMille was immortalized in Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\" when Gloria Swanson spoke the line: \"All right, Mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my close-up.\" DeMille plays himself in the film. DeMille's reputation had a renaissance in the 2010s.\nAs a filmmaker, DeMille was the aesthetic inspiration of many directors and films due to his early influence during the crucial development of the film industry. DeMille's early silent comedies influenced the comedies of Ernst Lubitsch and Charlie Chaplin's \"A Woman of Paris\". Additionally, DeMille's epics such as \"The Crusades\" influenced Sergei Eisenstein's \"Alexander Nevsky\". Moreover, DeMille's epics inspired directors such as Howard Hawks, Nicholas Ray, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and George Stevens to try producing epics. Cecil B. DeMille has influenced the work of several well-known directors. Alfred Hitchcock cited DeMille's 1921 film \"Forbidden Fruit\" as an influence of his work and one of his top ten favorite films. DeMille has influenced the careers of many modern directors. Martin Scorsese cited \"Unconquered\", \"Samson and Delilah\", and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" as DeMille films that have imparted lasting memories on him. Scorsese said he had viewed \"The Ten Commandments\" forty or fifty times. Famed director Steven Spielberg stated that DeMille's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" was one of the films that influenced him to become a filmmaker. Furthermore, DeMille influenced about half of Spielberg's films, including \"War of the Worlds\". \"The Ten Commandments\" inspired DreamWorks Animation's later film about Moses, \"The Prince of Egypt\". As one of the establishing members of the Paramount Pictures and co-founder of Hollywood, DeMille had a role in the development of the film industry. Consequently, the name \"DeMille\" has become synonymous with filmmaking.\nPublicly Episcopalian, DeMille drew on his Christian and Jewish heritage to convey a message of tolerance. DeMille received more than a dozen awards from Jewish religious and cultural groups, including B'nai B'rith. However, not everyone received DeMille's religious films favorably. DeMille was accused of antisemitism after the release of \"The King of Kings\", and director John Ford despised DeMille for what he saw as \"hollow\" biblical epics meant to promote DeMille's reputation during the politically turbulent 1950s. In response to the claims, DeMille donated some of the profits from \"The King of Kings\" to charity. In the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" poll, both DeMille's \"Samson and Delilah\" and 1923 version of \"The Ten Commandments\" received votes, but did not make the top 100 films. Although many of DeMille's films are available on DVD and Blu-ray release, only 20 of his silent films are commercially available on DVD \nCommemoration and tributes.\nThe original Lasky-DeMille Barn in which \"The Squaw Man\" was filmed was converted into a museum named the \"Hollywood Heritage Museum\". It opened on December 13, 1985 and features some of DeMille's personal artifacts. The Lasky-DeMille Barn was dedicated as a California historical landmark in a ceremony on December 27, 1956; DeMille was the keynote speaker. and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The Dunes Center in Guadalupe, California contains an exhibition of artifacts uncovered in the desert near Guadalupe from DeMille's set of his 1923 version of \"The Ten Commandments\", known as the \"Lost City of Cecil B. DeMille\". Donated by the Cecil B. DeMille Foundation in 2004, the moving image collection of Cecil B. DeMille is held at the Academy Film Archive and includes home movies, outtakes, and never-before-seen test footage.\nIn summer 2019, The Friends of the Pompton Lakes Library hosted a Cecil B DeMille film festival to celebrate DeMille's achievements and connection to Pompton Lakes. They screened four of his films at Christ Church, where DeMille and his family attended church when they lived there. Two schools have been named after him: Cecil B. DeMille Middle School, in Long Beach, California, which was closed and demolished in 2010 to make way for a new high school; and Cecil B. DeMille Elementary School in Midway City, California. The former film building at Chapman University in Orange, California, is named in honor of DeMille. During the Apollo 11 mission, Buzz Aldrin refers to himself in one instance as \"Cecil B. DeAldrin\", as a humorous nod to DeMille. The title of the 2000 John Waters film \"Cecil B. Demented\" alludes to DeMille.\nDeMille's legacy is maintained by his granddaughter Cecilia DeMille Presley who serves as the president of the Cecil B. DeMille Foundation, which strives to support higher education, child welfare, and film in Southern California. In 1963, the Cecil B. DeMille Foundation donated the \"Paradise\" ranch to the Hathaway Foundation, which cares for emotionally disturbed and abused children. A large collection of DeMille's materials including scripts, storyboards, and films resides at Brigham Young University in L. Tom Perry Special Collections.\nAwards and recognition.\nCecil B. DeMille received many awards and honors, especially later in his career. The American Academy of Dramatic Arts honored DeMille with an Alumni Achievement Award in 1958. In 1957, DeMille gave the commencement address for the graduation ceremony of Brigham Young University wherein he received an honorary Doctorate of Letter degree. Additionally, in 1958, he received an honorary Doctorate of Law degree from Temple University. From the film industry, DeMille received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the Academy Awards in 1953, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of America Award the same year. In the same ceremony, DeMille received a nomination from Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures for \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". In 1952, DeMille was awarded the first Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes. An annual award, the Golden Globe's Cecil B. DeMille Award recognizes lifetime achievement in the film industry. For his contribution to the motion picture and radio industry, DeMille has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The first, for radio contributions, is located at 6240 Hollywood Blvd. The second star is located at 1725 Vine Street.\nDeMille received two Academy Awards: an Honorary Award for \"37 years of brilliant showmanship\" in 1950 and a Best Picture award in 1953 for \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". DeMille received a Golden Globe Award for Best Director and was additionally nominated for the Best Director category at the 1953 Academy Awards for the same film. He was further nominated in the Best Picture category for \"The Ten Commandments\" at the 1957 Academy Awards. DeMille's \"Union Pacific\" received a Palme d'Or in retrospect at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.\nTwo of DeMille's films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: \"The Cheat\" (1915) and \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956).\nFilmography.\nCecil B. DeMille made 70 features. Fifty-two of his features are silent films. The first 24 of his silent films were made in the first three years of his career (1913-1916). Eight of his films were \"epics\" with five of those classified as \"Biblical\". Six of DeMille's films including \"The Arab\", \"The Wild Goose Chase\", \"The Dream Girl\", \"The Devil-Stone\", \"We Can't Have Everything\", and \"The Squaw Man\" (1918) were destroyed due to nitrate decomposition and are considered lost. \"The Ten Commandments\" is broadcast every Saturday at Passover in the United States on the ABC Television Network.\nDirected features.\nFilmography obtained from \"Fifty Hollywood Directors\".\nSilent films\nSound films\nDirecting or producing credit.\nThese films represent those which DeMille produced or assisted in directing, credited or uncredited.\nActing and cameos.\nDeMille frequently made cameos as himself in other Paramount films. Additionally, he often starred in prologues and special trailers that he created for his films, having an opportunity to personally address the audience."}

{"id": "6181", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6181", "title": "Chinese Islamic cuisine", "text": "Cuisine of Chinese Muslims (, Dungan: \u0427\u044b\u04a3\u0436\u04d9\u043d \u0446\u0430\u044b or , Dungan: \u04b2\u0443\u044d\u0439\u0437\u045e \u0446\u0430\u044b) is the cuisine of the Hui (ethnic Chinese Muslims) and other Muslims living in China such as Bonan, Dongxiang, Salar and Uyghurs as well as Dungans of Central Asia.\nHistory.\nDue to the large Muslim population in Western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to or are run by, Muslims. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in China proper. It is heavily influenced by Beijing cuisine, with nearly all cooking methods identical and differs only in material due to religious restrictions. As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home Beijing cuisine though seldom in east coast restaurants.\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, halal and kosher methods of slaughtering animals and preparing food was banned and forbidden by the Mongol emperors, starting with Genghis Khan who banned Muslims and Jews from slaughtering their animals their own way and made them follow the Mongol method.\nAmong all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say \u201cwe do not eat Mongol food\u201d. [Cinggis Qa\u2019an replied:] \u201cBy the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?\u201d He thereupon made them eat. \u201cIf you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.\u201d He issued a regulation to that effect ... [In 1279/1280 under Qubilai] all the Muslims say: \u201cif someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat\u201d. Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.\nTraditionally, there is a distinction between Northern and Southern Chinese Islamic cuisine despite both using lamb and mutton. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine relies heavily on beef, but rarely ducks, geese, shrimp or seafood, while southern Islamic cuisine is the reverse. The reason for this difference is due to availability of the ingredients. Oxen have been long used for farming and Chinese governments have frequently strictly prohibited the slaughter of oxen for food. However, due to the geographic proximity of the northern part of China to minority-dominated regions that were not subjected to such restrictions, beef could be easily purchased and transported to Northern China. At the same time, ducks, geese and shrimp are rare in comparison to Southern China due to the arid climate of Northern China.\nA Chinese Islamic restaurant () can be similar to a Mandarin restaurant with the exception that there is no pork on the menu and is primarily noodle/soup based.\nIn most major eastern cities in China, there are very limited Islamic/Halal restaurants, which are typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g., Uyghurs). They primarily offer inexpensive noodle soups only. These restaurants are typically decorated with Islamic motifs such as pictures of Islamic rugs and Arabic writing.\nAnother difference is that lamb and mutton dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of Western Chinese regions. (Refer to image 1.)\nOther Muslim ethnic minorities like the Bonan, Dongxiang, Salar and Tibetan Muslims have their own cuisines as well. Dongxiang people operate their own restaurants serving their cuisine.\nMany cafeterias (canteens) at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students (Hui or Western Chinese minorities), typically labeled \"qingzhen.\" Student ID cards sometimes indicate whether a student is Muslim and will allow access to these dining areas or will allow access on special occasions such as the Eid feast following Ramadan.\nSeveral Hui restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine exist in Los Angeles. San Francisco, despite its huge number of Chinese restaurants, appears to have only one whose cuisine would qualify as halal.\nMany Chinese Hui Muslims who moved from Yunnan to Burma (Myanmar) are known as Panthays operate restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine such as noodles. Chinese Hui Muslims from Yunnan who moved to Thailand are known as Chin Haw and they also own restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic food.\nIn Central Asia, Dungan people, descendants of Hui, operate restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine which is respectively referred to as \"Dungan cuisine\" there. They cater to Chinese businessmen. Chopsticks are used by Dungans. The cuisine of the Dungan resembles northwestern Chinese cuisine.\nMost Chinese regard Hui halal food as cleaner than food made by non-Muslims so their restaurants are popular in China. Hui who migrated to Northeast China (Manchuria) after the Chuang Guandong opened many new inns and restaurants to cater to travelers, which were regarded as clean.\nThe Hui who migrated to Taiwan operate Qingzhen restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine in Taipei and other big cities.\nThe Thai Department of Export Promotion claims that \"China's halal food producers are small-scale entrepreneurs whose products have little value added and lack branding and technology to push their goods to international standards\" to encourage Thai private sector halal producers to market their products in China.\nA 1903 started franchise which serves Muslim food is Dong Lai Shun in Hankou.\n400 meters have to be kept as a distance from each restaurant serving beef noodles to another of its type if they belong to Hui Muslims, since Hui have a pact between each other in Ningxia, Gansu and Shaanxi.\nHalal restaurants are checked up upon by clerics from mosques.\nHalal food manufacture has been sanctioned by the government of the Ningxia Autonomous Region.\nFamous dishes.\nLamian.\nLamian (, Dungan: \u041b\u0430\u043c\u044f\u043d) is a Chinese dish of hand-made noodles, usually served in a beef or mutton-flavored soup (\u6e6f\u9eaa, \u0434\u0430\u04a3\u043c\u044f\u043d, t\u0101ngmi\u00e0n), but sometimes stir-fried (\u7092\u9eaa, \u0427\u0430\u043e\u043c\u044f\u043d, ch\u01ceomi\u00e0n) and served with a tomato-based sauce. Literally, \u62c9, \u043b\u0430 (l\u0101) means to pull or stretch, while \u9eaa, \u043c\u044f\u043d (mi\u00e0n) means noodle. The hand-making process involves taking a lump of dough and repeatedly stretching it to produce a single very long noodle.\nWords that begin with L are not native to Turkic \u2014 l\u00e4ghm\u00e4n is a loanword as stated by Uyghur linguist Abdlikim: It is of Chinese derivation and not originally Uyghur.\nBeef noodle soup.\nBeef noodle soup is a noodle soup dish composed of stewed beef, beef broth, vegetables and wheat noodles. It exists in various forms throughout East and Southeast Asia. It was created by the Hui people during the Tang dynasty of China.\nIn the west, this food may be served in a small portion as a soup. In China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish.\nChuanr.\nChuanr (Chinese: \u4e32\u513f, Dungan: \u0427\u045e\u0430\u043d\u0440, Pinyin: chu\u00e0nr (shortened from \"chuan er\"), \"kebab\"), originating in the Xinjiang (\u65b0\u7586) province of China and in recent years has been disseminated throughout the rest of that country, most notably in Beijing. It is a product of the Chinese Islamic cuisine of the Uyghur (\u7ef4\u543e\u5c14) people and other Chinese Muslims. Yang rou chuan or lamb kebabs, is particularly popular.\nSuan cai.\nSuan cai is a traditional fermented vegetable dish, similar to Korean kimchi and German sauerkraut, used in a variety of ways. It consists of pickled Chinese cabbage. Suan cai is a unique form of pao cai due to the material used and the method of production. Although \"suan cai\" is not exclusive to Chinese Islamic cuisine, it is used in Chinese Islamic cuisine to top off noodle soups, especially beef noodle soup.\nNang.\n\"Nang\" (Chinese: \u9995, Dungan: \u041d\u04d9\u04a3) is a type of round unleavened bread, topped with sesame. It is similar to South and Central Asia naan."}
{"id": "6182", "revid": "1362799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6182", "title": "Cantonese cuisine", "text": "Cantonese or Yue cuisine is the cuisine of the Guangdong province of China, particularly the provincial capital, Guangzhou and the surrounding regions in the Pearl River Delta, including Hong Kong and Macau. Strictly speaking, Cantonese cuisine is the cuisine of Guangzhou or of Cantonese speakers, but it often includes the cooking styles of all the speakers of Yue Chinese languages in Guangdong. On the other hand, the Teochew cuisine and Hakka cuisine of Guangdong are considered their own styles, as is neighbouring Guangxi's cuisine despite eastern Guangxi being considered culturally Cantonese due to the presence of ethnic Zhuang influences in the rest of the province. Cantonese cuisine is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of Chinese cuisine. Its prominence outside China is due to the large number of Cantonese emigrants. Chefs trained in Cantonese cuisine are highly sought after throughout China. Until the late 20th century, most Chinese restaurants in the West served largely Cantonese dishes.\nBackground.\nGuangzhou (Canton) City, the provincial capital of Guangdong and the centre of Cantonese culture, has long been a trading hub and many imported foods and ingredients are used in Cantonese cuisine. Besides pork, beef and chicken, Cantonese cuisine incorporates almost all edible meats, including offal, chicken feet, duck's tongue, frog legs, snakes and snails. However, lamb and goat are less commonly used than in the cuisines of northern or western China. Many cooking methods are used, with steaming and stir frying being the most favoured due to their convenience and rapidity. Other techniques include shallow frying, double steaming, braising and deep frying.\nFor a lot of traditional Cantonese cooks, the flavours of a dish should be well balanced and not greasy. Apart from that, spices should be used in modest amounts to avoid overwhelming the flavours of the primary ingredients, and these ingredients in turn should be at the peak of their freshness and quality. There is no widespread use of fresh herbs in Cantonese cooking, in contrast with their liberal use in other cuisines such as Sichuanese, Vietnamese, Lao, Thai and European. Garlic chives and coriander leaves are notable exceptions, although the former are often used as a vegetable and the latter are usually used as mere garnish in most dishes.\nFoods.\nSauces and condiments.\nIn Cantonese cuisine, a number of ingredients such as sugar, salt, soy sauce, rice wine, cornstarch, vinegar, scallion and sesame oil, suffice to enhance flavour, although garlic is heavily used in some dishes, especially those in which internal organs, such as entrails, may emit unpleasant odours. Ginger, chili peppers, five-spice powder, powdered black pepper, star anise and a few other spices are also used, but often sparingly.\nDried and preserved ingredients.\nAlthough Cantonese cooks pay much attention to the freshness of their primary ingredients, Cantonese cuisine also uses a long list of preserved food items to add flavour to a dish. This may be influenced by Hakka cuisine, since the Hakkas were once a dominant group occupying imperial Hong Kong and other southern territories.\nSome items gain very intense flavours during the drying/preservation/oxidation process and some foods are preserved to increase their shelf life. Some chefs combine both dried and fresh varieties of the same items in a dish. Dried items are usually soaked in water to rehydrate before cooking. These ingredients are generally not served \"a la carte\", but rather with vegetables or other Cantonese dishes.\nTraditional dishes.\nA number of dishes have been part of Cantonese cuisine since the earliest territorial establishments of Guangdong. While many of these are on the menus of typical Cantonese restaurants, some simpler ones are more commonly found in Cantonese homes. Home-made Cantonese dishes are usually served with plain white rice.\nDeep fried dishes.\nThere are a small number of deep-fried dishes in Cantonese cuisine, which can often be found as street food. They have been extensively documented in colonial Hong Kong records of the 19th and 20th centuries. A few are synonymous with Cantonese breakfast and lunch, even though these are also part of other cuisines.\nSoups.\nOld fire soup, or \"lou fo tong\" (), is a clear broth prepared by simmering meat and other ingredients over a low heat for several hours. Chinese herbs are often used as ingredients. There are basically two ways to make old fire soup \u2013 put ingredients and water in the pot and heat it directly on fire, which is called \"bou tong\" (); or put the ingredients in a small stew pot, and put it in a bigger pot filled with water, then heat the bigger pot on fire directly, which is called \"dun tong\" (). The latter way can keep the most original taste of the soup.\nSoup chain stores or delivery outlets in cities with significant Cantonese populations, such as Hong Kong, serve this dish due to the long preparation time required of slow-simmered soup.\nSeafood.\nDue to Guangdong's location along the South China Sea coast, fresh seafood is prominent in Cantonese cuisine, and many Cantonese restaurants keep aquariums or seafood tanks on the premises. In Cantonese cuisine, as in cuisines from other parts of Asia, if seafood has a repugnant odour, strong spices and marinating juices are added; the freshest seafood is odourless and, in Cantonese culinary arts, is best cooked by steaming. For instance, in some recipes, only a small amount of soy sauce, ginger and spring onion is added to steamed fish. In Cantonese cuisine, the light seasoning is used only to bring out the natural sweetness of the seafood. As a rule of thumb, the spiciness of a dish is usually inversely proportionate to the freshness of the ingredients.\nNoodle dishes.\nNoodles are served either in soup broth or fried. These are available as home-cooked meals, on dim sum side menus, or as street food at dai pai dongs, where they can be served with a variety of toppings such as fish balls, beef balls, or fish slices.\nSiu mei.\n\"Siu mei\" () is essentially the Chinese rotisserie style of cooking. Unlike most other Cantonese dishes, \"siu mei\" solely consists of meat, with no vegetables.\nLou mei.\nLou mei () is the name given to dishes made from internal organs, entrails and other left-over parts of animals. It is widely available in southern Chinese regions.\nSiu laap.\nAll Cantonese-style cooked meats, including siu mei, lou mei and preserved meat can be classified as siu laap (). \"Siu laap\" also includes dishes such as:\nA typical dish may consist of offal and half an order of multiple varieties of roasted meat. The majority of siu laap is white meat.\nLittle pot rice.\nLittle pot rice () are dishes cooked and served in a flat-bottomed pot (as opposed to a round-bottomed wok). Usually this is a saucepan or braising pan (see clay pot cooking). Such dishes are cooked by covering and steaming, making the rice and ingredients very hot and soft. Usually the ingredients are layered on top of the rice with little or no mixing in between. Many standard combinations exist.\nBanquet/dinner dishes.\nA number of dishes are traditionally served in Cantonese restaurants only at dinner time. Dim sum restaurants stop serving bamboo-basket dishes after the yum cha period (equivalent to afternoon tea) and begin offering an entirely different menu in the evening. Some dishes are standard while others are regional. Some are customised for special purposes such as Chinese marriages or banquets. Salt and pepper dishes are one of the few spicy dishes.\nDessert.\nAfter the evening meal, most Cantonese restaurants offer \"tong sui\" (), a sweet soup. Many varieties of \"tong sui\" are also found in other Chinese cuisines. Some desserts are traditional, while others are recent innovations. The more expensive restaurants usually offer their specialty desserts. Sugar water is the general name of dessert in Guangdong province. It is cooked by adding water and sugar to some other cooking ingredients. It is said that Huazhou sugar water is the famous and popular one in Guangdong. There is a saying that Chinese sugar water is in Guangdong, and Cantonese sugar water in Huazhou. And the booming of Huazhou sugar water stores prove it.\nDelicacies.\nCertain Cantonese delicacies consist of parts taken from rare or endangered animals, which raises controversy over animal rights and environmental issues. This is often due to alleged health benefits of certain animal products. For example, the continued spreading of the idea that shark cartilage can cure cancer has led to decreased shark populations even though scientific research has found no evidence to support the credibility of shark cartilage as a cancer cure."}

Teochew cuisine bears more similarities to that of Fujian cuisine, particularly Southern Min cuisine, due to the similarity of Chaoshan's and Fujian's culture, language, and their geographic proximity to each other. However, Teochew cuisine is also influenced by Cantonese cuisine in its style and technique.\nBackground.\nTeochew cuisine is well known for its seafood and vegetarian dishes. Its use of flavouring is much less heavy-handed than most other Chinese cuisines and depends much on the freshness and quality of the ingredients for taste and flavour. As a delicate cuisine, oil is not often used in large quantities and there is a relatively heavy emphasis on poaching, steaming and braising, as well as the common Chinese method of stir-frying. Teochew cuisine is also known for serving congee (; or \"mue\"), in addition to steamed rice or noodles with meals. The Teochew \"\" is rather different from the Cantonese counterpart, being very watery with the rice sitting loosely at the bottom of the bowl, while the Cantonese dish is more a thin gruel.\nAuthentic Teochew restaurants serve very strong oolong tea called Tieguanyin in very tiny cups before and after the meal. Presented as \"gongfu\" tea, the tea has a thickly bittersweet taste, colloquially known as \"gam gam\" ().\nA condiment that is popular in Fujian and Taiwanese cuisine and commonly associated with cuisine of certain Teochew groups is shacha sauce (). It is made from soybean oil, garlic, shallots, chilies, brill fish and dried shrimp. The paste has a savoury and slightly spicy taste. As an ingredient, it has multiple uses: as a base for soups, as a rub for barbecued meats, as a seasoning for stir-fried dishes, or as a component for dipping sauces.\nIn addition to soy sauce (widely used in all Chinese cuisines), the Teochew diaspora in Southeast Asia use fish sauce in their cooking. It is used as a flavouring agent in soups and sometimes as a dipping sauce, as in Vietnamese spring rolls.\nTeochew chefs often use a special stock called superior broth (). This stock remains on the stove and is continuously replenished. Portrayed in popular media, some Hong Kong chefs allegedly use the same superior broth that is preserved for decades. This stock can as well be seen on Chaozhou TV's cooking programmes.\nThere is a notable feast in Teochew cuisine called \"\" (). A myriad of dishes are often served, which include shark fin soup, bird's nest soup, lobster, steamed fish, roasted suckling pig and braised goose.\nTeochew chefs take pride in their skills of vegetable carving, and carved vegetables are used as garnishes on cold dishes and on the banquet table.\nTeochew cuisine is also known for a late night meal known as \"meh siao\" () or \"daa laang\" () among the Cantonese. Teochew people enjoy eating out close to midnight in restaurants or at roadside food stalls. Some dai pai dong-like eateries stay open till dawn.\nUnlike the typical menu selections of many other Chinese cuisines, Teochew restaurant menus often have a dessert section.\nMany people of Chaoshan origin, also known as Teochiu or Teochew people, have settled in Hong Kong and places in Southeast Asia like Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand. Influences they bring can be noted in Singaporean cuisine and that of other settlements. A large number of Teochew people have also settled in Taiwan, evident in Taiwanese cuisine. Other notable Teochew diaspora communities are in Vietnam, Cambodia and France. A popular noodle soup in both Vietnam and Cambodia, known as hu tieu, originated from the Teochew. There is also a large diaspora of Teochew people (most were from Southeast Asia) in the United States - particularly in California. There is a Teochew Chinese Association in Paris called L'Amicale des Teochews en France."}

A decision problem is a member of co-NP if and only if its complement is in the complexity class NP. The class can be defined as follows: a decision problem is in co-NP precisely if for any \"no\"-instance \"x\" there is a \"certificate\" which a polynomial-time algorithm can use to verify that \"x\" is a \"no\"-instance.\nEquivalently, co-NP is the set of decision problems where there exists a polynomial \"p(n)\" and a polynomial-time bounded Turing machine such that for every instance \"x\", \"x\" is a yes instance if and only if: for every possible certificate \"c\" of length bounded by \"p(n)\", the Turing machine accepts the pair (\"x\", \"c\").\nProblems.\nThe complement of any problem in NP is a problem in co-NP. An example of an NP-complete problem is the circuit satisfiability problem: given a Boolean circuit, is there a possible input for which the circuit outputs true? The complementary problem asks: \"given a Boolean circuit, do all possible inputs to the circuit output false?\". This is in co-NP because a polynomial-time certificate of a \"no\"-instance is a set of inputs which make the output true.\nAn example of a problem that is known to belong to both NP and co-NP (but not known to be in P) is integer factorization: given positive integers \"m\" and \"n\", determine if \"m\" has a factor less than \"n\" and greater than one. Membership in NP is clear; if \"m\" does have such a factor, then the factor itself is a certificate. Membership in co-NP is also straightforward: one can just list the prime factors of \"m\", all greater or equal to n, which the verifier can confirm to be valid by multiplication and the AKS primality test. It is presently not known whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm for factorization, equivalently that integer factorization is in P, and hence this example is interesting as one of the most natural problems known to be in NP and co-NP but not known to be in P.\nA problem \"L\" is co-NP-complete if and only if \"L\" is in co-NP and for any problem in co-NP, there exists a polynomial-time reduction from that problem to \"L\". An example of such problem is that of determining if a formula in propositional logic is a tautology: that is, if the formula evaluates to true under every possible assignment to its variables.\nRelationship to other classes.\nP, the class of polynomial time solvable problems, is a subset of both NP and co-NP. P is thought to be a strict subset in both cases (and demonstrably cannot be strict in one case and not strict in the other).\nNP and co-NP are also thought to be unequal. If so, then no NP-complete problem can be in co-NP and no co-NP-complete problem can be in NP. This can be shown as follows. Suppose for the sake of contradiction there exists an NP-complete problem that is in co-NP. Since all problems in NP can be reduced to , it follows that for every problem in NP, we can construct a non-deterministic Turing machine that decides its complement in polynomial time; i.e., NP \u2286 co-NP. From this, it follows that the set of complements of the problems in NP is a subset of the set of complements of the problems in co-NP; i.e., co-NP \u2286 NP. Thus co-NP = NP. The proof that no co-NP-complete problem can be in NP if NP \u2260 co-NP is symmetrical."}
{"id": "6185", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6185", "title": "Chuck Yeager", "text": "Charles Elwood Yeager ( , February 13, 1923December 7, 2020) was a United States Air Force officer, flying ace, and record-setting test pilot who in 1947 became the first pilot in history confirmed to have exceeded the speed of sound in level flight.\nYeager's career began in World War II as a private in the United States Army, assigned to the Army Air Forces in 1941. After serving as an aircraft mechanic, in September 1942, he entered enlisted pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of flight officer (the World War II Army Air Force version of the Army's warrant officer), later achieving most of his aerial victories as a P-51 Mustang fighter pilot on the Western Front, where he was credited with shooting down 11.5 enemy aircraft (the half credit is from a second pilot assisting him in a single shootdown). On October 12, 1944, he attained \"ace in a day\" status, shooting down five enemy aircraft in one mission.\nAfter the war, Yeager became a test pilot and flew many types of aircraft, including experimental rocket-powered aircraft for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). Through the NACA program, he became the first human to officially break the sound barrier on October 14, 1947 when he flew the experimental Bell X-1 at Mach 1 at an altitude of , for which he won both the Collier and Mackay trophies in 1948. He then went on to break several other speed and altitude records in the following years.\nYeager later commanded fighter squadrons and wings in Germany, as well as in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. In recognition of his achievements and the outstanding performance ratings of those units, he was promoted to brigadier general in 1969 and inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1973, retiring on March 1, 1975. Yeager's three-war active-duty flying career spanned more than 30 years and took him to many parts of the world, including the Korean War zone and the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War. Throughout his life, he flew more than 360 different types of aircraft.\nEarly life and education.\nYeager was born February 13, 1923, to farming parents Susie Mae (\"n\u00e9e\" Sizemore; 1898\u20131987) and Albert Hal Yeager (1896\u20131963) in Myra, West Virginia. When he was five years old, his family moved to Hamlin, West Virginia. Yeager had two brothers, Roy and Hal Jr., and two sisters, Doris Ann (accidentally killed at age two by six-year-old Roy playing with a shotgun) and Pansy Lee. \nHe attended Hamlin High School, where he played basketball and football, receiving his best grades in geometry and typing. He graduated from high school in June 1941. \nHis first experience with the military was as a teen at the Citizens Military Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana, during the summers of 1939 and 1940. On February 26, 1945, Yeager married Glennis Dickhouse, and the couple had four children. Glennis died in 1990.\nHis cousin, Steve Yeager, was a professional baseball catcher.\nCareer.\nWorld War II.\nYeager enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) on September 12, 1941, and became an aircraft mechanic at George Air Force Base, Victorville, California. At enlistment, Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background, but the entry of the U.S. into World War II less than three months later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards. Yeager had unusually sharp vision (a visual acuity rated 20/10), which once enabled him to shoot a deer at .\nAt the time of his flight training acceptance, he was a crew chief on an AT-11. He received his pilot wings and a promotion to flight officer at Luke Field, Arizona, where he graduated from Class 43C on March 10, 1943. Assigned to the 357th Fighter Group at Tonopah, Nevada, he initially trained as a fighter pilot, flying Bell P-39 Airacobras (being grounded for seven days for clipping a farmer's tree during a training flight), and shipped overseas with the group on November 23, 1943.\nStationed in the United Kingdom at RAF Leiston, Yeager flew P-51 Mustangs in combat with the 363d Fighter Squadron. He named his aircraft \"Glamorous Glen\" after his girlfriend, Glennis Faye Dickhouse, who became his wife in February 1945. Yeager had gained one victory before he was shot down over France in his first aircraft (P-51B-5-NA s/n 43-6763) on March 5, 1944, on his eighth mission. He escaped to Spain on March 30, 1944 with the help of the \"Maquis\" (French Resistance) and returned to England on May 15, 1944. During his stay with the \"Maquis\", Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat; he helped construct bombs for the group, a skill that he had learned from his father. He was awarded the Bronze Star for helping a navigator, Omar M. \"Pat\" Patterson, Jr., to cross the Pyrenees.\nDespite a regulation prohibiting \"evaders\" (escaped pilots) from flying over enemy territory again, the purpose of which was to prevent resistance groups from being compromised by giving the enemy a second chance to possibly capture him, Yeager was reinstated to flying combat. He had joined another evader, fellow P-51 pilot 1st Lt Fred Glover, in speaking directly to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, on June 12, 1944. \"I raised so much hell that General Eisenhower finally let me go back to my squadron\" Yeager said. \"He cleared me for combat after D Day, because all the free Frenchmen \u2014 Maquis and people like that \u2014 had surfaced\". Eisenhower, after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. In the meantime, Yeager shot down his second enemy aircraft, a German Junkers Ju 88 bomber, over the English Channel.\nYeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership. On October 12, 1944, he became the first pilot in his group to make \"ace in a day,\" downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission. Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot: when he flew into firing position against a Messerschmitt Bf 109, the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman. Yeager said both pilots bailed out. He finished the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter, a German Messerschmitt Me 262 that he shot down as it was on final approach for landing.\nIn his 1986 memoirs, Yeager recalled with disgust that \"atrocities were committed by both sides\", and said he went on a mission with orders from the Eighth Air Force to \"strafe anything that moved\". During the mission briefing, he whispered to Major Donald H. Bochkay, \"If we are going to do things like this, we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side\". Yeager said, \"I'm certainly not proud of that particular strafing mission against civilians. But it is there, on the record and in my memory\". He also expressed bitterness at his treatment in England during World War II, describing the British as \"arrogant\" and \"nasty\".\nYeager was commissioned a second lieutenant while at Leiston, and was promoted to captain before the end of his tour. He flew his 61st and final mission on January 15, 1945, and returned to the United States in early February 1945. As an evader, he received his choice of assignments and, because his new wife was pregnant, chose Wright Field to be near his home in West Virginia. His high number of flight hours and maintenance experience qualified him to become a functional test pilot of repaired aircraft, which brought him under the command of Colonel Albert Boyd, head of the Aeronautical Systems Flight Test Division.\nPost-World War II.\nTest pilot \u2013 breaking the sound barrier.\nYeager remained in the U.S. Air Force after the war, becoming a test pilot at Muroc Army Air Field (now Edwards Air Force Base), following graduation from Air Materiel Command Flight Performance School (Class 46C). After Bell Aircraft test pilot Chalmers \"Slick\" Goodlin demanded US$150,000 (over US$1.7 million in 2020 dollars) to break the sound \"barrier\", the USAAF selected Yeager to fly the rocket-powered Bell XS-1 in a NACA program to research high-speed flight.\nSuch was the difficulty of this task that the answer to many of the inherent challenges was along the lines of \"Yeager better have paid-up insurance\". Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight, Yeager broke two ribs when he fell from a horse. He was worried that the injury would remove him from the mission and reported that he went to a civilian doctor in nearby Rosamond, California, who taped his ribs. Besides his wife who was riding with him, Yeager told only his friend and fellow project pilot Jack Ridley about the accident. On the day of the flight, Yeager was in such pain that he could not seal the X-1's hatch by himself. Ridley rigged up a device, using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever, to allow Yeager to seal the hatch.\nYeager broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947, in level flight while piloting the X-1 \"Glamorous Glennis\" at Mach 1.05 at an altitude of over the Rogers Dry Lake of the Mojave Desert in California. The success of the mission was not announced to the public until June 1948. Yeager was awarded the Mackay Trophy and the Collier Trophy in 1948 for his mach-transcending flight, and the Harmon International Trophy in 1954. The X-1 he flew that day was later put on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.\nYeager went on to break many other speed and altitude records. He was also one of the first American pilots to fly a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, after its pilot, No Kum-sok, defected to South Korea. Returning to Muroc, during the latter half of 1953, Yeager was involved with the USAF team that was working on the X-1A, an aircraft designed to surpass Mach 2 in level flight. That year, he flew a chase aircraft for the civilian pilot Jackie Cochran as she became the first woman to fly faster than sound.\nOn November 20, 1953, the U.S. Navy program involving the D-558-II Skyrocket and its pilot, Scott Crossfield, became the first team to reach twice the speed of sound. After they were bested, Ridley and Yeager decided to beat rival Crossfield's speed record in a series of test flights that they dubbed \"Operation NACA Weep\". Not only did they beat Crossfield by setting a new record at Mach 2.44 on December 12, 1953, but they did it in time to spoil a celebration planned for the 50th anniversary of flight in which Crossfield was to be called \"the fastest man alive\".\nThe new record flight, however, did not entirely go to plan, since shortly after reaching Mach 2.44, Yeager lost control of the X-1A at about due to inertia coupling, a phenomenon largely unknown at the time. With the aircraft simultaneously rolling, pitching, and yawing out of control, Yeager dropped in less than a minute before regaining control at around . He then managed to land without further incident. For this achievement, Yeager was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1954.\nMilitary command.\nYeager was foremost a fighter pilot and held several squadron and wing commands. From 1954 to 1957, he commanded the F-86H Sabre-equipped 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (50th Fighter-Bomber Wing) at Hahn AB, West Germany, and Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France; and from 1957 to 1960 the F-100D Super Sabre-equipped 1st Fighter Day Squadron at George Air Force Base, California, and Mor\u00f3n Air Base, Spain.\nNow a full colonel in 1962, after completion of a year's studies and final thesis on STOL aircraft at the Air War College, Yeager became the first commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School, which produced astronauts for NASA and the USAF, after its redesignation from the USAF Flight Test Pilot School. (Yeager himself had only a high school education, so he was not eligible to become an astronaut like those he trained.) In April 1962, Yeager flew for the only time with Neil Armstrong. Their job, flying a T-33, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake in Nevada for use as an emergency landing site for the North American X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue.\nYeager's participation in the test pilot training program for NASA included controversial behavior. Yeager reportedly did not believe that Ed Dwight, the first African American pilot admitted into the program, should be a part of it. In \"Chasing the Moon\" the filmmakers report that Yeager instructed staff and participants at the school that \"Washington is trying to cram the [n-word] down our throats. [President] Kennedy is using this to make 'racial equality,' so do not speak to him, do not socialize with him, do not drink with him, do not invite him over to your house, and in six months he'll be gone.\" In his autobiography, Dwight details how Yeager's leadership led to discriminatory treatment throughout his training at Edwards Airforce base. \nBetween December 1963 and January 1964, Yeager completed five flights in the NASA M2-F1 lifting body. An accident during a December 1963 test flight in one of the school's NF-104s eventually put an end to his record attempts.\nIn 1966, Yeager took command of the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing at Clark Air Base, the Philippines, whose squadrons were deployed on rotational temporary duty (TDY) in South Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. There he flew 127 missions. In February 1968, Yeager was assigned command of the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, and led the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II wing in South Korea during the \"Pueblo\" crisis.\nYeager was promoted to brigadier general and was assigned in July 1969 as the vice-commander of the Seventeenth Air Force.\nFrom 1971 to 1973, at the behest of Ambassador Joseph Farland, Yeager was assigned to Pakistan to advise the Pakistan Air Force. A small passenger aircraft that was assigned by the Pentagon to Yeager was damaged during an air raid by the Indian Air Force at a Pakistani airbase during the 1971 war between India and Pakistan. Edward C. Ingraham, a U.S. diplomat who had served as political counselor to Ambassador Farland in Islamabad, recalled this incident in the \"Washington Monthly\" of October 1985: \"After Yeager's Beechcraft was destroyed during an Indian air raid, he raged to his cowering colleagues that the Indian pilot had been specifically instructed by Indira Gandhi to blast his plane. \"It was\", he later wrote, \"the Indian way of giving Uncle Sam the finger\". Yeager was incensed over the incident and demanded U.S. retaliation.\nPost-retirement career.\nOn March 1, 1975, following assignments in West Germany and Pakistan, Yeager retired from the Air Force at Norton Air Force Base, California.\nYeager made a cameo appearance in the movie \"The Right Stuff\" (1983). He played \"Fred\", a bartender at \"Pancho's Place\", which was most appropriate, as Yeager said, \"if all the hours were ever totaled, I reckon I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years\". Sam Shepard portrayed Yeager in the film.\nFor several years in the 1980s, Yeager was connected to General Motors, publicizing ACDelco, the company's automotive parts division. In 1986, he was invited to drive the Chevrolet Corvette pace car for the 70th running of the Indianapolis 500. In 1988, Yeager was again invited to drive the pace car, this time at the wheel of an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. In 1986, President Reagan appointed Yeager to the Rogers Commission that investigated the explosion of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\".\nDuring this time, Yeager also served as a technical adviser for three Electronic Arts flight simulator video games. The games include \"Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer\", \"Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer 2.0\", and \"Chuck Yeager's Air Combat\". The game manuals featured quotes and anecdotes from Yeager, and were well received by players. Missions featured several of Yeager's accomplishments and let players attempt to top his records. \"Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer\" was Electronic Art's top selling game for 1987.\nIn 2009, Yeager participated in the documentary \"The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club\", a profile of his friend Pancho Barnes. The documentary was screened at film festivals, aired on public television in the United States, and won an Emmy Award.\nOn October 14, 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight past Mach 1, he flew a new \"Glamorous Glennis III\", an F-15D Eagle, past Mach 1. The chase plane for the flight was an F-16 Fighting Falcon piloted by Bob Hoover, a longtime test, fighter, and aerobatic pilot who had been Yeager's wingman for the first supersonic flight. At the end of his speech to the crowd in 1997, Yeager concluded, \"All that I am ... I owe to the Air Force\". Later that month, he was the recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his achievements.\nOn October 14, 2012, on the 65th anniversary of breaking the sound barrier, Yeager did it again at the age of 89, flying as co-pilot in a McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain David Vincent out of Nellis Air Force Base.\nAwards and decorations.\nIn 1973, Yeager was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, arguably aviation's highest honor. In 1974, Yeager received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In December 1975, the U.S. Congress awarded Yeager a silver medal \"equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor ... for contributing immeasurably to aerospace science by risking his life in piloting the X-1 research airplane faster than the speed of sound on October 14, 1947\". President Gerald Ford presented the medal to Yeager in a ceremony at the White House on December 8, 1976.\nYeager, who never attended college and was often modest about his background, is considered by many, including \"Flying Magazine\", the California Hall of Fame, the State of West Virginia, National Aviation Hall of Fame, a few U.S. presidents, and the United States Army Air Force, to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. Despite his lack of higher education, he was honored in his home state. Marshall University named its highest academic scholarship, the Society of Yeager Scholars, in his honor. Yeager was also the chairman of Experimental Aircraft Association's Young Eagle Program from 1994 to 2004, and was named the program's chairman emeritus.\nIn 1966, Yeager was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1981. He was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor 1990 inaugural class.\nYeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia, is named in his honor. The Interstate 64/Interstate 77 bridge over the Kanawha River in Charleston is named in his honor. He also flew directly under the Kanawha Bridge and West Virginia named it to the Chuck E. Yeager Bridge. On October 19, 2006, the state of West Virginia also honored Yeager with a marker along Corridor G (part of U.S. Highway 119) in his home Lincoln County, and also renamed part of the highway the \"Yeager Highway\".\nYeager was an honorary board member of the humanitarian organization Wings of Hope. On August 25, 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver announced that Yeager would be one of 13 California Hall of Fame inductees in The California Museum's yearlong exhibit. The induction ceremony was on December 1, 2009, in Sacramento, California. \"Flying Magazine\" ranked Yeager number 5 on its 2013 list of The 51 Heroes of Aviation; for many years, he was the highest-ranked living person on the list.\nThe Civil Air Patrol, the volunteer auxiliary of the USAF, awards the Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager Award to its Senior Members as part of its Aerospace Education program.\nPersonal life.\nYeager named his plane after his wife Glennis as a good-luck charm; \"You're my good-luck charm, hon. Any airplane I name after you always brings me home.\" Yeager and Glennis moved to Grass Valley, California, after his retirement from the Air Force in 1975. The couple prospered because of Yeager's best-selling autobiography, speaking engagements, and commercial ventures. Glennis Yeager died of ovarian cancer in 1990. They had four children (Susan, Don, Mickey, and Sharon). Yeager's son Mickey (Michael) died unexpectedly in Oregon, on March 26, 2011.\nYeager appeared in a Texas advertisement for George H. W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign.\nIn 2000, Yeager met actress Victoria Scott D'Angelo on a hiking trail in Nevada County. The pair started dating shortly thereafter, and married in August 2003. Subsequent to the commencement of their relationship, a bitter dispute arose between Yeager, his children and D'Angelo. The children contended that D'Angelo, 35 years Yeager's junior, had married him for his fortune. Yeager and D'Angelo both denied the charge. Litigation ensued, in which his children accused D'Angelo of \"undue influence\" on Yeager, and Yeager accused his children of diverting millions of dollars from his assets.

Cajun cuisine is sometimes referred to as a 'rustic cuisine', meaning that it is based on locally available ingredients and that preparation is relatively simple.\nAn authentic Cajun meal is usually a three-pot affair, with one pot dedicated to the main dish, one dedicated to steamed rice, specially made sausages, or some seafood dish, and the third containing whatever vegetable is plentiful or available. Crawfish, shrimp, and andouille sausage are staple meats used in a variety of dishes.\nThe aromatic vegetables green bell pepper (), onion, and celery are called \"the trinity\" by Cajun chefs in Cajun and Louisiana Creole cuisines. Roughly diced and combined in cooking, the method is similar to the use of the \"mirepoix\" in traditional French cuisine which blends roughly diced carrot, onion, and celery. Characteristic aromatics for the Creole version may also include parsley, bay leaf, green onions, dried cayenne pepper, and dried black pepper.\nHistory.\nThe Acadians were a group of French colonists who were residing in modern-day Canada. In the mid-18th century, they were deported from Acadia by the British during the French and Indian War in what they termed \"le Grand D\u00e9rangement\", and many of them ended up settling in Southern Louisiana. Due to the extreme change in climate, Acadians were unable to cook their original dishes. Soon, their former culinary traditions were lost, and so, these other meals developed to become what is now considered classic Cajun cuisine traditions (not to be confused with the more modern concept associated with Prudhomme's style). Up through the 20th century, the meals were not elaborate but instead, rather basic. The public's false perception of \"Cajun\" cuisine was based on Prudhomme's style of Cajun cooking, which was spicy, flavorful, and not true to the classic form of the cuisine. Cajun and Creole label have been mistaken to be the same, but the origins of Creole cooking began in New Orleans, and Cajun cooking came 40 years after the establishment of New Orleans. Today, most restaurants serve dishes that consist of Cajun styles, which Paul Prudhomme dubbed \"Louisiana cooking\". In home-cooking, these individual styles are still kept separate. However, there are fewer and fewer people cooking the classic Cajun dishes that would have been eaten by the original settlers.\nCajun cooking methods.\nDeep-frying of turkeys or oven-roasted turduckens entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, blackening of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine. Blackening was actually an invention by chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1970s, becoming associated with Cajun cooking, and presented as such by him, but is not a true historical or traditional Cajun cooking process.\nIngredients.\nThe following is a partial list of ingredients used in Cajun cuisine and some of the staple ingredients of the Acadian food culture.\nMeat and seafood.\nCajun foodways include many ways of preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and mass-produced meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or duck confit (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.\nGame (and hunting) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.\nThe recent increase of catfish farming in the Mississippi Delta has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in the place of the more traditional wild-caught trout (the saltwater species).\nSeafood\nAlso included in the seafood mix are some so-called trash fish that would not sell at market because of their high bone to meat ratio or required complicated cooking methods. These were brought home by fishermen to feed the family. Examples are garfish, black drum also called gaspergou or just \"goo\", croaker, and bream.\nPoultry\nPork\nBeef and dairy&lt;br&gt;\nThough parts of Acadiana are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Cajun form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the US, although seasoned differently.\nDairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are no unique dairy items prepared in Cajun cuisine. Traditional Cajun and New Orleans Creole-influenced desserts are common.\nOther game meats\nSeasonings.\nThyme, sage, mint, marjoram, savory, and basil are considered sweet herbs. In Colonial times a herbes de Provence would be several sweet herbs tied up in a muslin.\nCajun dishes.\nPrimary favorites.\nBoudin is a type of sausage made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic, green onions and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. Boudin is typically stuffed in a natural casing and has a softer consistency than other, better-known sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, maque choux or bread. Boudin balls are commonly served in southern Louisiana restaurants and are made by taking the boudin out of the case and frying it in spherical form.\nGumbo - High on the list of favorites of Cajun cooking are the soups called gumbos. Contrary to non-Cajun or Continental beliefs, gumbo does not mean simply \"everything in the pot\". Gumbo exemplifies the influence of French, Spanish, African and Native American food cultures on Cajun cuisine. The name originally meant \"okra\", a word brought to the region from western Africa. Okra which can be one of the principal ingredients in gumbo recipes is used as a thickening agent and for its distinct vegetable flavor. Many claim that Gumbo is a \"Cajun\" dish, but Gumbo was established long before the Acadian arrival. Its early existence came via the early French Creole culture In New Orleans, Louisiana, where French, Spanish and Africans frequented and also influenced by later waves of Italian, German and Irish settlers.\nA fil\u00e9 gumbo is thickened with dried sassafras leaves after the stew has finished cooking, a practice borrowed from the Choctaw Indians. The backbone of a gumbo is roux of which there are two variations: Cajun, a golden brown roux, and Creole, a dark roux, which is made of flour, toasted until well-browned, and fat or oil. The classic gumbo is made with chicken and the Cajun sausage called andouille, pronounced {ahn-doo-wee}, but the ingredients vary according to what is available.\nJambalaya - Another classic Cajun dish is jambalaya. The only certain thing that can be said about a jambalaya is that it contains rice, some sort of meat (such as chicken or beef), seafood (such as shrimp or crawfish) or almost anything else. Usually, however, one will find green peppers, onions, celery, tomatoes and hot chili peppers. Anything else is optional. This is also a great pre-Acadian dish, established by the Spanish in Louisiana.\nRice and gravy - Rice and gravy dishes are a staple of Cajun cuisine and is usually a brown gravy based on pan drippings, which are deglazed and simmered with extra seasonings and served over steamed or boiled rice. The dish is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a cast iron pot, typically for an extended time period in order to let the tough cuts of meat become tender. Beef, pork, chicken or any of a large variety of game meats are used for its preparation. Popular local varieties include hamburger steak, smothered rabbit, turkey necks, and chicken fricassee.\nFood as an event.\nCrawfish boil.\nThe crawfish boil is a celebratory event where Cajuns boil crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn in large pots over propane cookers. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper, and other spices, commonly known as \"crab boil\" or \"crawfish boil\" are added to the water for seasoning. The results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in Creole/Cajun spice blends, such as REX, Zatarain's, Louisiana Fish Fry, or Tony Chachere's. Also, cocktail sauce, mayonnaise, and hot sauce are sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand. During times when crawfish are not abundant, shrimp and crabs are prepared and served in the same manner.\nAttendees are encouraged to \"suck the head\" of a crawfish by separating the head from the abdomen of the crustacean and sucking out the fat and juices from the head.\nOften, newcomers to the crawfish boil or those unfamiliar with the traditions are jokingly warned \"not to eat the dead ones.\" This comes from the common belief that when live crawfish are boiled, their tails curl beneath themselves, but when dead crawfish are boiled, their tails are straight and limp.\nSeafood boils with crabs and shrimp are also popular.\nFamily.\nThe traditional Cajun outdoor food event hosted by a farmer in the rural areas of the Acadiana. Family and friends of the farmer gather to socialize, play games, dance, drink, and have a copious meal consisting of hog and other dishes. Men have the task of slaughtering a hog, cutting it into usable parts, and cooking the main pork dishes while women have the task of making boudin.\nSimilar to a family , the is a food event that revolves around pork but does not need to be hosted by a farmer. Traditionally, a suckling pig was purchased for the event, but in modern , adult pigs are used. Unlike the family , a hog is not butchered by the hosts and there are generally not as many guests or activities. The host and male guests have the task of roasting the pig (see pig roast) while female guests bring side dishes.\nRural Mardi Gras.\nThe traditional Cajun Mardi Gras (see: \"Courir de Mardi Gras\") is a Mardi Gras celebration in rural Cajun Parishes. The tradition originated in the 18th century with the Cajuns of Louisiana, but it was abandoned in the early 20th century because of unwelcome violence associated with the event. In the early 1950s the tradition was revived in Mamou in Evangeline Parish.\nThe event revolves around male maskers on horseback who ride into the countryside to collect food ingredients for the party later on. They entertain householders with Cajun music, dancing, and festive antics in return for the ingredients. The preferred ingredient is a live chicken in which the householder throws the chicken to allow the maskers to chase it down (symbolizing a hunt), but other ingredients include rice, sausage, vegetables, or frozen chicken. Unlike other Cajun events, men take no part in cooking the main course for the party, and women prepare the chicken and ingredients for the gumbo. Once the festivities begin, the Cajun community members eat and dance to Cajun music until midnight after which is the beginning of Lent.\nIn popular culture.\nThree popular local dishes in Acadiana are noted in the Hank Williams song \"Jambalaya\", namely \"Jambalaya and-a crawfish pie and fil\u00e9 gumbo\"."}
{"id": "6187", "revid": "41196868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6187", "title": "Cologne", "text": "Cologne ( ; ; ; , usually shortened to ) is the largest city of Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and the fourth-most populous city in Germany. With slightly over a million inhabitants within its city boundaries, Cologne is the largest city on the Rhine and also the most populous city of both the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region and the Rhineland. Centered on the left bank of the Rhine, Cologne is about southeast of NRW's capital of D\u00fcsseldorf and northwest of Bonn. It is the largest city in the Central Franconian and Ripuarian dialect areas.\nThe city's Cologne Cathedral (\"K\u00f6lner Dom\") is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Cologne. There are many institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the University of Cologne (\"Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln\"), one of Europe's oldest and largest universities; the Technical University of Cologne (\"Technische Hochschule K\u00f6ln\"), Germany's largest university of applied sciences; and the German Sport University Cologne (\"Deutsche Sporthochschule K\u00f6ln\"), Germany's only sport university. Cologne Bonn Airport (\"Flughafen K\u00f6ln/Bonn\") is Germany's seventh-largest airport and lies in the southeast of the city. The main airport for the Rhine-Ruhr region is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\nCologne was founded and established in Ubii territory in the 1st century AD as the Roman \"Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium\", the first word of which is the origin of its name. An alternative Latin name of the settlement is \"Augusta Ubiorum\", after the Ubii. \"Cologne\", the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. Cologne functioned as the capital of the Roman province of \"Germania Inferior\" and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462. During the Middle Ages the city flourished as being located on one of the most important major trade routes between east and western Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities north of the Alps in medieval and Renaissance times. Prior to World War II, the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918\u20131926). Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, with the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropping of bombs on the city. The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city centre. With the intention of restoring as many historic landmarks as possible, the postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.\nCologne is a major cultural centre for the Rhineland; it hosts more than 30 museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The Cologne Trade Fair hosts a number of trade shows such as Art Cologne, imm Cologne, Gamescom, and the Photokina.\nHistory.\nRoman Cologne.\nThe first urban settlement on the grounds of modern-day Cologne was \"Oppidum Ubiorum\", founded in 38\u00a0BC by the Ubii, a Cisrhenian Germanic tribe. In 50\u00a0AD, the Romans founded \"Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium\" (Cologne) on the river Rhine and the city became the provincial capital of Germania Inferior in 85\u00a0AD. Considerable Roman remains can be found in present-day Cologne, especially near the wharf area, where a 1,900-year-old Roman boat was discovered in late 2007. From 260 to 271, Cologne was the capital of the Gallic Empire under Postumus, Marius, and Victorinus. In 310, under emperor Constantine I, a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centres in the Roman Empire north of the Alps. Cologne is shown on the 4th century Peutinger Map.\nMaternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until it was occupied by the Ripuarian Franks in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the new sewerage system having opened in 1890.\nMiddle Ages.\nEarly medieval Cologne was part of Austrasia within the Frankish Empire. In 716, Charles Martel commanded an army for the first time and suffered the only defeat of his life when Chilperic II, King of Neustria, invaded Austrasia and the city fell to him in the Battle of Cologne. Charles fled to the Eifel mountains, rallied supporters and took the city back that same year after defeating Chilperic in the Battle of Ambl\u00e8ve. Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under Charlemagne, in 795, bishop Hildebold was promoted to archbishop. In the 843 Treaty of Verdun Cologne fell into the dominion of Lothair I's Middle Francia \u2013 later called Lotharingia (Lower Lorraine).\nIn 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power when bishop Bruno was appointed as duke by his brother Otto I, King of Germany. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his archiepiscopal successors with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the Electorate of Cologne, formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of J\u00fclich, as well as the Duchy of Westphalia on the other side of the Rhine, beyond Berg and Mark. By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was Archchancellor of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.\nFollowing the Battle of Worringen in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a Free City. Archbishop Sigfried II von Westerburg was forced to reside in Bonn. The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, the sentence for which was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge known as the \"Greve\". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.\nBesides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's archbishop, Rainald of Dassel, gave the relics of the Three Wise Men to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they, in fact, had been taken from Milan). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of Saint Ursula and Albertus Magnus.\nCologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west as well as the main south\u2013north Western Europe trade route, Northern Italy to Flanders. The intersection of these trade routes were the basis of Cologne's growth. By 1300 the city population was 50,000\u201355,000. Cologne was a member of the Hanseatic League in 1475, when Frederick III confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.\nEarly modern history.\nThe economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.\nAs a free imperial city, Cologne was a self-ruling state within the Holy Roman Empire, an imperial estate with seat and vote at the Imperial Diet, and as such had the right (and obligation) to contribute to the defense of the Empire and maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the \"Rote Funken\" (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the Holy Roman Empire (\"Reichskontingent\") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the \"Rote Funken\".\nThe Free Imperial City of Cologne must not be confused with the Electorate of Cologne which was a state of its own within the Holy Roman Empire. Since the second half of the 16th century the majority of archbishops were drawn from the Bavaria Wittelsbach dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in Bonn and later in Br\u00fchl on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as electors, the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.\nFrom the 19th century until World War II.\nCologne lost its status as a free city during the French period. According to the Peace Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville (1801) all the territories of the Holy Roman Empire on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the French Republic (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of Napoleon's Empire. Cologne was part of the French D\u00e9partement Roer (named after the river Roer, German: Rur) with Aachen (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the Napoleonic code and removing the old elites from power. The Napoleonic code remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the \"B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch\") was introduced in the German Empire. In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna, Cologne was made part of the Kingdom of Prussia, first in the J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg province and then the Rhine province.\nThe permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic Rhineland and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, Clemens August von Droste-Vischering, was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (\"Mischehenstreit\"). In 1874, during the Kulturkampf, Archbishop Paul Melchers was imprisoned before taking asylum in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, became the first West German chancellor.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War\u00a0I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing was especially successful, though the heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the Ruhr area. The cathedral, started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded German empire and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.\nCologne was designated as one of the Fortresses of the German Confederation. It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of Verdun and Li\u00e8ge) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day. The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.\nDuring World War\u00a0I Cologne was the target of several minor air raids but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the British Army of the Rhine until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent Versailles Peace Treaty.\nIn contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. Konrad Adenauer, the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.\nAs part of the demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (\"Gr\u00fcng\u00fcrtel\") around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the University of Cologne, closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the University of Strasbourg on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of Alsace. Cologne prospered during the Weimar Republic (1919\u201333), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at M\u00fcngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to Berlin Tempelhof Airport.\nThe democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the Nazi Party and other extreme-right parties. The Nazis then arrested the Communist and Social Democrats members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in Reichstag elections had always been the national average.) By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (\"Milit\u00e4rbereichshauptkommandoquartier\") for the Military District (\"Wehrkreis\") VI of M\u00fcnster. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in Bonn, Siegburg, Aachen, J\u00fclich, D\u00fcren, and Monschau. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.\nThe Allies dropped 44,923.2 tons of bombs on the city during World War II, destroying 61% of its built up area. During the Bombing of Cologne in World War II, Cologne endured 262 air raids by the Western Allies, which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of \"Operation Millennium\", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the Royal Air Force in World War\u00a0II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary. This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed of built-up area (61%), killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless. The devastation was recorded by Hermann Claasen from 1942 until the end of the war, and presented in his exhibition and book of 1947 \"Singing in the furnace. Cologne \u2013 Remains of an old city\"\nCologne was taken by the American First Army in early March 1945. By the end of the war, the population of Cologne had been reduced by 95 percent. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas. The same happened in many other German cities in the last two years of war. By the end of 1945, however, the population had already recovered to approximately 450,000.\nBy the end of the war, essentially all of Cologne's pre-war Jewish population of 11,000 had been deported or killed by the Nazis. The six synagogues of the city were destroyed. The synagogue on Roonstra\u00dfe was rebuilt in 1959.\nPost-war Cologne until today.\nDespite Cologne's status as the largest city in the region, nearby D\u00fcsseldorf was chosen as the political capital of the federated state of North Rhine-Westphalia. With Bonn being chosen as the provisional federal capital (\"provisorische Bundeshauptstadt\") and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally West Germany), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became\u2013and still is\u2013home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.\nIn 1945 architect and urban planner Rudolf Schwarz called Cologne the \"world's greatest heap of rubble\". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the \"Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt\" (\"North-South-Drive\"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.\nThe destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous Twelve Romanesque churches such as St.\u00a0Gereon, Great St.\u00a0Martin, St.\u00a0Maria im Kapitol and several other monuments in World War\u00a0II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the G\u00fcrzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of St.\u00a0Kunibert was finished.\nIn 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1\u00a0million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1\u00a0million again.\nPost-reunification.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strong visual focal point in Cologne's city centre and includes the \"K\u00f6lnTurm\", one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.\nDue to the economic success of the Cologne Trade Fair, the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to RTL, Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.\nCologne was the focus of the 2015-16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, with over 500 women reporting that they were sexually assaulted by persons of African and Arab appearance.\nGeography.\nThe metropolitan area encompasses over , extending around a central point that lies at 50\u00b0 56' 33 latitude and 6\u00b0 57' 32 longitude. The city's highest point is above sea level (the Monte Troodel\u00f6h) and its lowest point is above sea level (the Worringer Bruch). The city of Cologne lies within the larger area of the Cologne Lowland, a cone-shaped area of the central Rhineland that lies between Bonn, Aachen and D\u00fcsseldorf.\nDistricts.\nCologne is divided into 9 boroughs (\"Stadtbezirke\") and 85 districts (\"Stadtteile\"):\nClimate.\nLocated in the Rhine-Ruhr area, Cologne is one of the warmest cities in Germany. It has a temperate\u2013oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\") with cool winters and warm summers. It is also one of the cloudiest cities in Germany, with just 1567.5 hours of sun a year. Its average annual temperature is : during the day and at night. In January, the mean temperature is , while the mean temperature in July is . The record high temperature of happened on 25 July 2019 during the July 2019 European heat wave in which Cologne saw three consecutive days over . Especially the inner urban neighbourhoods experience a greater number of hot days, as well as significantly higher temperatures during night time compared to the surrounding area (including the airport, where temperatures are classified). Still temperatures can vary noticeably over the course of a month with warmer and colder weather. Precipitation is spread evenly throughout the year with a light peak in summer due to showers and thunderstorms.\nFlood protection.\nCologne is regularly affected by flooding from the Rhine and is considered the most flood-prone European city. A city agency (\"Stadtentw\u00e4sserungsbetriebe K\u00f6ln\", \"Cologne Urban Drainage Operations\") manages an extensive flood control system which includes both permanent and mobile flood walls, protection from rising waters for buildings close to the river banks, monitoring and forecasting systems, pumping stations and programmes to create or protect floodplains, and river embankments. The system was redesigned after a 1993 flood, which resulted in heavy damage.\nDemographics.\nIn the Roman Empire the city was large and rich with a population of 40,000 in 100\u2013200\u00a0AD. The city was home to around 20,000 people in 1000\u00a0AD, growing to 50,000 in 1200\u00a0AD. The Rhineland metropolis still had 50,000 residents in 1300\u00a0AD.\nCologne is the fourth-largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg and Munich. As of 31 December 2016, there were 1,080,701 people registered as living in Cologne in an area of . The population density was . The metropolitan area of the Cologne Bonn Region is home to 3,573,500 living on . It is part of the polycentric megacity region Rhine-Ruhr with a population of over 11,000,000 people.\nThere were 546,498 women and 522,694 men in Cologne. For every 1,000 males, there were 1,046 females. In 2015, there were 11,337 births in Cologne (of which 34.53% were to unmarried women); 7,704 marriages and 2,203 divorces, and 9,629 deaths. In the city, the population was spread out, with 15.6% under the age of 18, and 17.6% were 65 years of age or older. 163 people in Cologne were over the age of 100.\nAccording to the Statistical Office of the City of Cologne, the number of people with a migrant background is at 36.7% (393,793). 2,537 people acquired German citizenship in 2015.\nIn 2015, there were 557,090 households, of which 18.3% had children under the age of 18; 50.6% of all households were made up of singles. 8.7% of all households were single-parent households. The average household size was 1.87.\nResidents of Cologne with foreign citizenship.\nCologne residents with a foreign citizenship as of 31 December 2015 is as follows:\nLanguage.\nColognian or K\u00f6lsch () (natively \"K\u00f6lsch Platt\") is a small set of very closely related dialects, or variants, of the Ripuarian Central German group of languages. These dialects are spoken in the area covered by the Archdiocese and former Electorate of Cologne reaching from Neuss in the north to just south of Bonn, west to D\u00fcren and east to Olpe in the North-West of Germany. K\u00f6lsch is one of the very few city dialects in Germany, which also include the dialect spoken in Berlin, for example.\nReligion.\nAs of 2015, 35.5% of the population belonged to the Catholic Church, the largest religious body, and 15.5% to the Evangelical Church. Irenaeus of Lyons claimed that Christianity was brought to Cologne by Roman soldiers and traders at an unknown early date. It is known that in the early second century it was a bishop's seat. The first historical Bishop of Cologne was Saint Maternus. Thomas Aquinas studied in Cologne in 1244 under Albertus Magnus. Cologne is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne.\nAccording to the 2011 census, 2.1% of the population was Eastern Orthodox, 0.5% was member of an Evangelical Free Church and 4.2% belonged to further religious communities officially recognized by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (such as Jehovah's Witnesses).\nThere are several mosques, including the Cologne Central Mosque run by the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs. In 2011, about 11.2% of the population was Muslim.\nCologne also has one of the oldest and largest Jewish communities in Germany. In 2011, 0.3% of Cologne's population was Jewish.\nGovernment.\nThe city's administration is headed by the mayor and the three deputy mayors.\nPolitical traditions and developments.\nThe long tradition of a free imperial city, which long dominated an exclusively Catholic population and the age-old conflict between the church and the bourgeoisie (and within it between the patricians and craftsmen) have created its own political climate in Cologne. Various interest groups often form networks beyond party boundaries. The resulting web of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favours, obligations and dependencies, is called the 'Cologne coterie'. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a \"waste scandal\" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.\nMayor.\nThe Lord Mayor of Cologne is Henriette Reker. She received 52.66% of the vote at the municipal election on 17 October 2015 and was appointed on 15 December 2015. She was re-elected in a runoff election on 27 September 2020, where she received 59.27% of the vote.\nElections.\nCity Councillors are elected for a five-year term and the Mayor has a six-year term.\nCityscape.\nThe inner city of Cologne was completely destroyed during World War\u00a0II. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example, the opera house by Wilhelm Riphahn, are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture. Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the Cologne Opera house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.\nGreen areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately of public green space for every inhabitant.\nWildlife.\nThe presence of animals in Cologne is generally limited to insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. Pigeons are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds is augmented each year by a growing population of feral exotics, most visibly parrots such as the rose-ringed parakeet. The sheltered climate in southeast Northrhine-Westphalia allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases, they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green parrots is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colours of the cityscape.\nTourism.\nCologne had 5.8\u00a0million overnight stays booked and 3.35\u00a0million arrivals in 2016. The city also has the most pubs per capita in Germany. The city has 70 clubs, \"countless\" bars, restaurants, and pubs.\nLandmarks.\nMedieval houses.\nThe Cologne City Hall (\"K\u00f6lner Rathaus\"), founded in the 12th century, is the oldest city hall in Germany still in use. The Renaissance-style loggia and tower were added in the 15th century. Other famous buildings include the G\u00fcrzenich, Haus Saaleck and the Overstolzenhaus.\nMedieval city gates.\nOf the twelve medieval city gates that once existed, only the Eigelsteintorburg at Ebertplatz, the Hahnentor at Rudolfplatz and the Severinstorburg at Chlodwigplatz still stand today.\nBridges.\nSeveral bridges cross the Rhine in Cologne. They are (from south to north): the Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge, South Bridge (railway), Severin Bridge, Deutz Bridge, Hohenzollern Bridge (railway), Zoo Bridge (\"Zoobr\u00fccke\") and Cologne M\u00fclheim Bridge. In particular the iron tied arch Hohenzollern Bridge (\"Hohenzollernbr\u00fccke\") is a dominant landmark along the river embankment. A Rhine crossing of a special kind is provided by the Cologne Cable Car (German: \"K\u00f6lner Seilbahn\"), a cableway that runs across the Rhine between the Cologne Zoological Garden in Riehl and the Rheinpark in Deutz.\nHigh-rise structures.\nCologne's tallest structure is the Colonius telecommunication tower at . The observation deck has been closed since 1992. A selection of the tallest buildings in Cologne is listed below. Other tall structures include the Hansahochhaus (designed by architect Jacob Koerfer and completed in 1925 \u2013 it was at one time Europe's tallest office building), the Kranhaus buildings at Rheinauhafen, and the Messeturm K\u00f6ln (\"trade fair tower\").\nCulture.\nCologne has several museums. The famous Roman-Germanic Museum features art and architecture from the city's distant past; the Museum Ludwig houses one of the most important collections of modern art in Europe, including a Picasso collection matched only by the museums in Barcelona and Paris. The Museum Schn\u00fctgen of religious art is partly housed in St.\u00a0Cecilia, one of Cologne's Twelve Romanesque churches.\nMany art galleries in Cologne enjoy a worldwide reputation like e.g. Galerie Karsten Greve, one of the leading galleries for postwar and contemporary art.\nSeveral orchestras are active in the city, among them the G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra, which is also the orchestra of the Cologne Opera and the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne (\"German State Radio Orchestra\"), both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building (K\u00f6lner Philharmonie). Other orchestras are the Musica Antiqua K\u00f6ln and the WDR Rundfunkorchester K\u00f6ln, and several choirs, including the WDR Rundfunkchor K\u00f6ln. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio f\u00fcr elektronische Musik, Karlheinz Stockhausen) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station WDR was involved in promoting musical movements such as Krautrock in the 1970s; the influential Can was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the \"Kwartier Lat\u00e4ng\" (the student quarter around the Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe) and the nightclub-studded areas around Hohenzollernring, Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.\nThe large annual literary festival Lit. Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is the writer Heinrich B\u00f6ll, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.\nCologne is well known for its beer, called K\u00f6lsch. K\u00f6lsch is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of K\u00f6lsch being the only language one can drink.\nCologne is also famous for Eau de Cologne (German: \"K\u00f6lnisch Wasser\"; lit: \"Water of Cologne\"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate Johann Maria Farina at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century, this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and \"Farina\" became a household name for \"Eau de Cologne\". In 1803 Wilhelm M\u00fclhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and M\u00fchlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson Ferdinand M\u00fclhens was forced to abandon the name \"Farina\" for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, 4711. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the Farina family, currently in the eighth generation, and by M\u00e4urer &amp; Wirtz who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.\nCarnival.\nThe Cologne carnival is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11\u00a0a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until Ash Wednesday. However, the so-called \"Tolle Tage\" (crazy days) do not start until \"Weiberfastnacht\" (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, \"Wieverfastelovend\", the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival. Z\u00fclpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.\nRivalry with D\u00fcsseldorf.\nCologne and D\u00fcsseldorf have a \"fierce regional rivalry\", which includes carnival parades, football, and beer. People in Cologne prefer K\u00f6lsch while people in D\u00fcsseldorf prefer Altbier (\"Alt\"). Waiters and patrons will \"scorn\" and make a \"mockery\" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne or K\u00f6lsch in D\u00fcsseldorf. The rivalry has been described as a \"love\u2013hate relationship\".\nMusic fairs and festivals.\nThe city was home to the internationally famous Ringfest, and now to the C/o pop festival.&lt;ref name=\"C/o pop\"&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;\nIn addition, Cologne enjoys a thriving Christmas Market (\"Weihnachtsmarkt\") presence with several locations in the city.\nEconomy.\nAs the largest city in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, Cologne benefits from a large market structure. In competition with D\u00fcsseldorf, the economy of Cologne is primarily based on insurance and media industries, while the city is also an important cultural and research centre and home to a number of corporate headquarters.\nAmong the largest media companies based in Cologne are Westdeutscher Rundfunk, RTL Television (with subsidiaries), n-tv, Deutschlandradio, Brainpool TV and publishing houses like J.\u00a0P. Bachem, Taschen, Tandem Verlag, and M.\u00a0DuMont Schauberg. Several clusters of media, arts and communications agencies, TV production studios, and state agencies work partly with private and government-funded cultural institutions. Among the insurance companies based in Cologne are Central, DEVK, DKV, Generali Deutschland, Gen Re, Gothaer, HDI Gerling and national headquarters of AXA Insurance, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group and Zurich Financial Services.\nThe German flag carrier Lufthansa and its subsidiary Lufthansa CityLine have their main corporate headquarters in Cologne. The largest employer in Cologne is Ford Europe, which has its European headquarters and a factory in Niehl (Ford-Werke GmbH). Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG), Toyota's official motorsports team, responsible for Toyota rally cars, and then Formula One cars, has its headquarters and workshops in Cologne. Other large companies based in Cologne include the REWE Group, T\u00dcV Rheinland, Deutz AG and a number of K\u00f6lsch breweries. Cologne has the country's highest density of pubs per capita. The largest three K\u00f6lsch breweries are Reissdorf, Gaffel, and Fr\u00fch.\nHistorically, Cologne has always been an important trade city, with land, air, and sea connections. The city has five Rhine ports, the second largest inland port in Germany and one of the largest in Europe. Cologne-Bonn Airport is the second largest freight terminal in Germany. Today, the Cologne trade fair (\"Koelnmesse\") ranks as a major European trade fair location with over 50 trade fairs and other large cultural and sports events. In 2008 Cologne had 4.31\u00a0million overnight stays booked and 2.38\u00a0million arrivals. Cologne's largest daily newspaper is the \"K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger\".\nCologne shows a significant increase in startup companies, especially when considering digital business.\nCologne has also become the first German city with a population of more than a million people to declare climate emergency.\nTransport.\nRoad transport.\nRoad building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor Konrad Adenauer. The first German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and Bonn. Today, this is the Bundesautobahn 555. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ring road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (\"Stadtautobahn\") was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became \"Bundesstra\u00dfe (\"Federal Road\") B 55a\", which begins at the \"Zoobr\u00fccke\" (\"Zoo Bridge\") and meets with A\u00a04 and A\u00a03 at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as \"Stadtautobahn\" by most locals. In contrast to this, the \"Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt\" (\"North-South-Drive\") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as Fritz Schumacher in the 1920s. The last section south of \"Ebertplatz\" was completed in 1972.\nIn 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in North Rhine-Westphalia was opened to traffic on Bundesautobahn\u00a03, part of the eastern section of the Cologne Beltway between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.\nCycling.\nCompared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very bicycle-friendly. It has repeatedly ranked among the worst in an independent evaluation conducted by the Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club. In 2014 it ranked 36th out of 39 German cities with a population greater than 200,000.\nRail transport.\nCologne has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at \"K\u00f6ln Hauptbahnhof\" (Cologne Main Station), \"K\u00f6ln Messe/Deutz\" and \"Cologne/Bonn Airport\". ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Cologne with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 1h47, 9 departures/day) and Paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main and Berlin. ICE Trains to London via the Channel Tunnel were planned for 2013.\nThe Cologne Stadtbahn operated by K\u00f6lner Verkehrsbetriebe (KVB) is an extensive light rail system that is partially underground and serves Cologne and a number of neighbouring cities. It evolved from the tram system. Nearby Bonn is linked by both the Stadtbahn and main line railway trains, and occasional recreational boats on the Rhine. D\u00fcsseldorf is also linked by S-Bahn trains, which are operated by Deutsche Bahn.\nThe Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn has 5 lines which cross Cologne.The S13/S19 runs 24/7 between Cologne Hbf and Cologne/Bonn airport.\nThere are also frequent buses covering most of the city and surrounding suburbs, and Eurolines coaches to London via Brussels.\nWater transport.\n\"H\u00e4fen und G\u00fcterverkehr K\u00f6ln\" (Ports and Goods traffic Cologne, HGK) is one of the largest operators of inland ports in Germany. Ports include K\u00f6ln-Deutz, K\u00f6ln-Godorf, and K\u00f6ln-Niehl\u00a0I and II.\nAir transport.\nCologne's international airport is Cologne/Bonn Airport (CGN). It is also called Konrad Adenauer Airport after Germany's first post-war Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who was born in the city and was mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933. The airport is shared with the neighbouring city of Bonn. Cologne is headquarters to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).\nEducation.\nCologne is home to numerous universities and colleges, and host to some 72,000 students. Its oldest university, the University of Cologne (founded in 1388) is the largest university in Germany, as the Cologne University of Applied Sciences is the largest university of Applied Sciences in the country. The Cologne University of Music and Dance is the largest conservatory in Europe. Foreigners can have German lessons in the VHS (Adult Education Centre).\nLauder Morijah School (), a Jewish school in Cologne, previously closed. After Russian immigration increased the Jewish population, the school reopened in 2002.\nMedia.\nWithin Germany, Cologne is known as an important media centre. Several radio and television stations, including Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR), RTL and VOX, have their headquarters in the city. Film and TV production is also important. The city is \"Germany's capital of TV crime stories\". A third of all German TV productions are made in the Cologne region. Furthermore, the city hosts the Cologne Comedy Festival, which is considered to be the largest comedy festival in mainland Europe.\nSports.\nCologne hosts 1. FC K\u00f6ln, who play in the 1. Bundesliga. They play their home matches in RheinEnergieStadion which also hosted 5 matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The International Olympic Committee and Internationale Vereinigung Sport- und Freizeiteinrichtungen e.V. gave RheinEnergieStadion a bronze medal for \"being one of the best sporting venues in the world\". Cologne also hosts FC Viktoria K\u00f6ln 1904 and SC Fortuna K\u00f6ln, who currently play in the 3.

{"id": "6188", "revid": "16889069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6188", "title": "Buddhist cuisine", "text": "Buddhist cuisine is an Asian cuisine that is followed by monks and many believers from areas historically influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of ahimsa (non-violence). Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism, as well as East Asian religions like Taoism. While monks and a minority of believers are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet for celebrations.\nThe origin of \"Buddhist food\" as a distinct sub-style of cuisine is tied to monasteries, where one member of the community would have the duty of being the head cook and supplying meals that paid respect to the strictures of Buddhist precepts. Temples that were open to visitors from the general public might also serve meals to them and a few temples effectively run functioning restaurants on the premises. In Japan, this practice is generally known as , and served at many temples, especially in Kyoto. A more recent version, more Chinese in style, is prepared by the \u014cbaku school of zen, and known as ; this is served at the head temple of Manpuku-ji, as well as various subtemples. In modern times, commercial restaurants have also latched on to the style, catering both to practicing and non-practicing lay people.\nPhilosophies governing food.\nVegetarianism.\nMost of the dishes considered to be uniquely Buddhist are vegetarian, but not all Buddhist traditions require vegetarianism of lay followers or clergy. Vegetarian eating is primarily associated with the East and Southeast Asian tradition in China, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea where it is commonly practiced by clergy and may be observed by laity on holidays or as a devotional practice.\nIn the Mahayana tradition, several sutras of the Mahayana canon contain explicit prohibitions against consuming meat, including sections of the Lankavatara Sutra and Surangama Sutra. The monastic community in Chinese Buddhism, Vietnamese Buddhism and most of Korean Buddhism strictly adhere to vegetarianism. Japanese Buddhist sects generally believe that Buddha ate meat. All Japanese Kamakura sects of Buddhism (Zen, Nichiren, Jodo) have relaxed Mahayana vinaya, and as a consequence, vegetarianism is optional. \nTheravada Monks and nuns traditionally feed themselves by gathering alms, and generally must eat whatever foods are given to them, including meat. The exception to this alms rule is when monks and nuns have seen, heard or known that animal(s) have been specifically killed to feed the alms-seeker, in which case consumption of such meat would be karmically negative, as well as meat from certain animals, such as dogs and snakes, that were regarded as impure in ancient India. The same restriction is also followed by some lay Buddhists and is known as the consumption of \"triply clean meat\" (\u4e09\u51c0\u8089). The Pali Sutras also describe the Buddha as refusing a suggestion by his student Devadatta to mandate vegetarianism in the monastic precepts.\nTibetan Buddhism has long accepted that the practical difficulties in obtaining vegetables and grains within most of Tibet make it impossible to insist upon vegetarianism; however, many leading Tibetan Buddhist teachers agree upon the great worth of practicing vegetarianism whenever and wherever possible.\nBoth Mahayana and Theravada Buddhists consider that one may practice vegetarianism as part of cultivating Bodhisattvas's paramita.\nOther restrictions.\nIn addition to the ban on garlic, practically all Mahayana monastics in China, Korea, Vietnam and Japan specifically avoid eating strong-smelling plants, traditionally asafoetida, shallot, mountain leek and Allium chinense, which together with garlic are referred to as \"w\u01d4 h\u016bn\" (\u4e94\u8477, or 'Five Acrid and Strong-smelling Vegetables') or \"w\u01d4 x\u012bn\" (\u4e94\u8f9b or 'Five Spices') as they tend to excite senses. This is based on teachings found in the Brahamajala Sutra, the Surangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra (chapter eight). In modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the onion genus, as well as coriander. The origin of this additional restriction is from the Indic region and can still be found among some believers of Hinduism and Jainism. Some Taoists also have this additional restriction but the list of restricted plants differs from the Buddhist list.\nThe food that a strict Buddhist takes, if not a vegetarian, is also specific. For many Chinese Buddhists beef and the consumption of large animals and exotic species is avoided. Then there would be the aforementioned \"triply clean meat\" rule. One restriction on food that is not known to many is the abstinence from eating animal innards and organs. This is known as \"xi\u00e0shui\" (\u4e0b\u6c34), not to be confused with the term for sewage.\nAlcohol and other drugs are also avoided by many Buddhists because of their effects on the mind and \"mindfulness\". It is part of the Five Precepts which dictate that one is not to consume \"addictive materials\". The definition of \"addictive\" depends on each individual but most Buddhists consider alcohol, tobacco and drugs other than medicine to be addictive. Although caffeine is now also known to be addictive, caffeinated drinks and especially tea are not included under this restriction; tea in particular is considered to be healthful and beneficial and its mild stimulant effect desirable. There are many legends about tea. Among meditators it is considered to keep the person alert and awake without overexcitement.\nSimple and natural.\nIn theory and practice, many regional styles of cooking may be adapted to be \"Buddhist\" as long as the cook, with the above restrictions in mind, prepares the food, generally in simple preparations, with expert attention to its quality, wholesomeness and flavor. Often working on a tight budget, the monastery cook would have to make the most of whatever ingredients were available.\nIn \"Tenzo kyokun\" (\"Instructions for the Zen Cook\"), Soto Zen founder Eihei Dogen wrote the following about the Zen attitude toward food:\nIn preparing food, it is essential to be sincere and to respect each ingredient regardless of how coarse or fine it is. (...) A rich buttery soup is not better as such than a broth of wild herbs. In handling and preparing wild herbs, do so as you would the ingredients for a rich feast, wholeheartedly, sincerely, clearly. When you serve the monastic assembly, they and you should taste only the flavour of the Ocean of Reality, the Ocean of unobscured Awake Awareness, not whether or not the soup is creamy or made only of wild herbs. In nourishing the seeds of living in the Way, rich food and wild grass are not separate.\"\"\nIngredients.\nFollowing its dominant status in most parts of East Asia where Buddhism is most practiced, rice features heavily as a staple in the Buddhist meal, especially in the form of rice porridge or congee as the usual morning meal. Noodles and other grains may often be served as well. Vegetables of all sorts are generally either stir-fried or cooked in vegetarian broth with seasonings and may be eaten with various sauces. Traditionally eggs and dairy are not permitted. Seasonings will be informed by whatever is common in the local region; for example, soy sauce and vegan dashi figure strongly in Japanese monastery food while curry and T\u01b0\u01a1ng (as a vegetarian replacement for fish sauce) may be prominent in Southeast Asia. Sweets and desserts are not often consumed, but are permitted in moderation and may be served at special occasions such as in the context of a tea ceremony in the Zen tradition.\nBuddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared wheat gluten, also known as seitan, kao fu (\u70e4\u9eb8) or wheat meat, soy (such as tofu or tempeh), agar, konnyaku and other plant products. Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined meat analogues in the world. Soy and wheat gluten are very versatile materials, because they can be manufactured into various shapes and textures, and they absorb flavorings (including, but not limited to, meat-like flavorings), while having very little flavor of their own. With the proper seasonings, they can mimic various kinds of meat quite closely.\nSome of these Buddhist vegetarian chefs are in the many monasteries and temples which serve allium-free and mock-meat (also known as 'meat analogues') dishes to the monks and visitors (including non-Buddhists who often stay for a few hours or days, to Buddhists who are not monks, but staying overnight for anywhere up to weeks or months). Many Buddhist restaurants also serve vegetarian, vegan, non-alcoholic or allium-free dishes.\nSome Buddhists eat vegetarian on the 1st and 15th of the lunar calendar (lenten days), on Chinese New Year eve, and on saint and ancestral holy days. To cater to this type of customer, as well as full-time vegetarians, the menu of a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant usually shows no difference from a typical Chinese or East Asian restaurant, except that in recipes originally made to contain meat, a soy chicken substitute might be served instead.\nVariations by sect or region.\nAccording to cookbooks published in English, formal monastery meals in the Zen tradition generally follow a pattern of \"three bowls\" in descending size. The first and largest bowl is a grain-based dish such as rice, noodles or congee; the second contains the protein dish which is often some form of stew or soup; the third and smallest bowl is a vegetable dish or a salad."}

Tischendorf was made an Honorary Doctor by Oxford University on 16 March 1865, and an Honorary Doctor by Cambridge University on 9 March 1865 following this find of the century. While a student gaining his academic degree in the 1840s, he earned international recognition when he deciphered the \"Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus\", a 5th-century Greek manuscript of the New Testament.\nEarly life and education.\nTischendorf was born in Lengenfeld, Saxony, near Plauen, the son of a physician. Beginning in 1834, he spent his scholarly career at the University of Leipzig where he was mainly influenced by JGB Winer, and he began to take special interest in New Testament criticism. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible. In 1838 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, then became master at a school near Leipzig.\nAfter a journey through southern Germany and Switzerland, and a visit to Strassburg, he returned to Leipzig, and set to work upon a critical study of the New Testament text. \nCareer.\nIn 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a dissertation on the recensions of the New Testament text, the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. His critical apparatus included variant readings from earlier scholars, Elsevier, Georg Christian Knapp, Johann Martin Augustin Scholz, and as recent as Karl Lachmann, whereby his research was emboldened to depart from the received text as used in churches. These early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact collations of manuscripts. \nFrom October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, Firmin Didot, several editions of the Greek New Testament \u2013 one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the Vulgate. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.\nA great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the palimpsest \"Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus\", of which the New Testament part was printed before he left Paris, and the Old Testament in 1845. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of Ephrem the Syrian, had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became \"professor extraordinarius\" at Leipzig, where he was married in 1845. He also began to publish \"Reise in den Orient\", an account of his travels in the east (in 2 vols., 1845\u201346, translated as \"Travels in the East\" in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (this is a document where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), he was not able to identify the value or meaning of the \"Archimedes Palimpsest\", a torn leaf of which he held and after his death was sold to the Cambridge University Library.\nFrom Paris, he had paid short visits to the Netherlands (1841) and England (1842). In 1843 he visited Italy, and after a stay of thirteen months, went on to Egypt, Sinai, and the Levant, returning via Vienna and Munich.\nDiscovery of the Codex Sinaiticus Bible manuscripts.\nIn 1844 Tischendorf travelled the first time to Saint Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt, where he found a portion of what would later be hailed as the oldest complete known New Testament. Of the many pages which were contained in an old wicker basket (the kind that the monastery hauled in its visitors as customary in unsafe territories) he was given 43 pages containing a part of the Old Testament as a present. He donated those 43 pages to King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony (reigned 1836\u20131854), to honour him and to recognise his patronage as the funder of Tischenforf's journey. (Tischendorf held a position as Theological Professor at Leipzig University, also under the patronage of Frederick Augustus II.) Leipzig University put two of the leaves on display in 2011.\nTischendorf reported in his 1865 book \"Wann Wurden Unsere Evangelen Verfasst\", translated to English in 1866 as \"When Were Our Gospels Written\" in the section \"The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript\" that he found, in a trash basket, forty-three sheets of parchment of an ancient copy of the Greek Old Testament, reporting that the monks were using the trash to start fires. And Tischendorf, horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the University of Leipzig, under the title of the \"Codex Friderico-Augustanus\", a name given in honour of his patron, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846, although Tischendorf kept the place of discovery a secret.\nMany have expressed skepticism at the historical accuracy of this report of saving a 1500-year-old parchment from the flames. J. Rendel Harris referred to the story as a \"myth\". The Tischendorf Lesebuch (see References) quotes that the Librarian Kyrillos mentioned to Tischendorf that the contents of the basket had already twice been submitted to the fire. The contents of the baskets were damaged scriptures, the third filling apparently, so cited by Tischendorf himself.[see Tischendorf Lesebuch, Tischendorf's own account]. \nIn 1853 Tischendorf made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of Tsar Alexander II of Russia with the active aid of the Russian government to find more of the \"Codex Frederico-Augustanus\" or similar ancient Biblical texts. On 4 February, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant \u2013 the \"Codex Sinaiticus\" \u2013 a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century.\nTischendorf persuaded the monks to present the manuscript to Tsar Alexander II of Russia, at the cost of the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those ignorant of the details of his discovery of the \"Codex Sinaiticus\" accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant monastery librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation can not be done. This token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a \"Schenkungsurkunde\". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the National Russian Library the existence cannot be disputed in earnest. In 1869 the Tsar awarded Tischendorf the style of \"von\" Tischendorf as a Russian noble. 327 facsimile editions of the Codex were printed in Leipzig for the Tsar (instead of a salary for the three-year work of Tischendorf the Tsar gave him 100 copies for reselling) in order to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the traditional foundation of the Rus' state in 862 with the publication of this most amazing find. Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.\nWhen the 4-volume luxury edition of the Sinai Bible was completed in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Tsar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop and some of the brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the British Museum in London, England. The official certificate with signatures in Russian/ French/ Greek sections has been refound in St Petersburg.\nNovum Testamentum Graece \u2013 publication with 21 editions.\nIn the winter of 1849 the first edition of his great work now titled \"Novum Testamentum Graece. Ad antiquos testes recensuit. Apparatum criticum multis modis\" appeared (translated as \"Greek New Testament. The ancient witnesses reviewed. Preparations critical in many ways\"), containing canons of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:\nBasic rule: \"The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and fathers.\"\nThese were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, \"to clear up in this way,\" he wrote, \"the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine apostolic text which is the foundation of our faith.\"\nIn 1850 appeared his edition of the \"Codex Amiatinus\" (in 1854 corrected) and of the Septuagint version of the Old Testament (7th ed., 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the \"Codex Claromontanus\".\nMeanwhile, also in 1859, he had been made \"professor ordinarius\" of theology and of Biblical paleography, this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, \"Aus dem heiligen Lande\", appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.\nBesides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both Robert Schumann, with whom he corresponded, and Felix Mendelssohn, who dedicated a song to him. His text critical colleague Samuel Prideaux Tregelles wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the University of Glasgow, where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.\nHe died in Leipzig on 7 December 1874.\nCodex Sinaiticus.\nThe \"Codex Sinaiticus\" contains a 4th-century manuscript of New Testament texts. Two other Bibles of similar age exist, though they are less complete: Codex Vaticanus in the Vatican Library and Codex Alexandrinus, currently owned by the British Library. The Codex Sinaiticus is deemed by some to be the most important surviving New Testament manuscript, as no older manuscript is as nearly complete as the Codex. The codex can be viewed in the British Library in London, or as a digitized version on the Internet.\nTischendorf's motivation.\nThroughout his life Tischendorf sought old biblical manuscripts, as he saw it as his task to give theology a Greek New Testament which was based on the oldest possible scriptures. He intended to be as close as possible to the original sources. Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery of Saint Catherine on the Sinai Peninsula, which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).\nIn 1862 Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in both an illustrious four-volume facsimile edition and in a less costly text edition, to enable all scholars to have access to the Codex.\nTischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. His motive, as explained in a publication on Tischendorf's Letter by Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leibzig University, Prof. of Theology), was to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustfully transmitted over centuries.\nWorks.\nHis \"magnum opus\" was the \"Critical Edition of the New Testament.\"\nThe great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself \"editio viii\"; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from stereotype plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869\u201372 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the Vatican manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend Samuel Prideaux Tregelles.\nOf relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the \"Codex Ephraemi\", and the \"Friderico-Augustanus\", was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of Eberhard Nestle's appendix to the 6th issue (1880).\nBesides this may be mentioned editions of the New Testament apocrypha, \"De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu\" (1851); \"Acta Apostolorum apocrypha\" (1851); \"Evangelia apocrypha\" (1853; 2nd ed., 1876); \"Apocalypses apocryphae\" (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as \"Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?\" (\"When Were Our Gospels Written?\"; 1865; 4th ed., 1866, digitized by Google and available for e-readers), \"Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?\" (1873), and \"Synopsis evangelica\" (7th ed., 1898)."}
{"id": "6195", "revid": "1108604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6195", "title": "Calvin Coolidge", "text": "Calvin Coolidge (born John Calvin Coolidge Jr.; ; July 4, 1872 \u2013 January 5, 1933) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929. A Republican lawyer from New England, born in Vermont, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, eventually becoming governor of Massachusetts. His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action. The next year, he was elected the 29th vice president of the United States, and he succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923. Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative and also as a man who said very little and had a rather dry sense of humor.\nCoolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor's administration, and left office with considerable popularity. As a Coolidge biographer wrote: \"He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class, could interpret their longings and express their opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength.\"\nScholars have ranked Coolidge in the lower half of those presidents that they have assessed. He is praised by advocates of smaller government and laissez-faire economics, while supporters of an active central government generally view him less favorably, although most praise his stalwart support of racial equality.\nEarly life and family history.\nJohn Calvin Coolidge Jr. was born on July 4, 1872 in Plymouth Notch, Vermont, the only U.S. president to be born on Independence Day. He was the elder of the two children of John Calvin Coolidge Sr. (1845\u20131926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846\u20131885). Although named for his father, John, from early childhood Coolidge was addressed by his middle name, Calvin. His middle name was selected in honor of John Calvin, considered a founder of the Congregational church in which Coolidge was raised and remained active throughout his life.\nCoolidge Senior engaged in many occupations and developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper, and public servant. He held various local offices, including justice of the peace and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate. Coolidge's mother was the daughter of Hiram Dunlap Moor, a Plymouth Notch farmer and Abigail Franklin. She was chronically ill and died at the age of 39, perhaps from tuberculosis, when Coolidge was twelve years old. His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875\u20131890), died at the age of 15, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was 18. Coolidge's father married a Plymouth schoolteacher in 1891, and lived to the age of 80.\nCoolidge's family had deep roots in New England; his earliest American ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, England, around 1630 and settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. Coolidge's great-great-grandfather, also named John Coolidge, was an American military officer in the Revolutionary War and one of the first selectmen of the town of Plymouth. His grandfather Calvin Galusha Coolidge served in the Vermont House of Representatives. Coolidge was also a descendant of Samuel Appleton, who settled in Ipswich and led the Massachusetts Bay Colony during King Philip's War.\nEarly career and marriage.\nEducation and law practice.\nCoolidge attended Black River Academy and then St. Johnsbury Academy, before enrolling at Amherst College, where he distinguished himself in the debating class. As a senior, he joined the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta and graduated \"cum laude\". While at Amherst, Coolidge was profoundly influenced by philosophy professor Charles Edward Garman, a Congregational mystic, with a neo-Hegelian philosophy.\nCoolidge explained Garman's ethics forty years later:\n[T]here is a standard of righteousness that might does not make right, that the end does not justify the means, and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail. The only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service...\nAt his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge moved to Northampton, Massachusetts to become a lawyer. To avoid the cost of law school, Coolidge followed the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond &amp; Field, and reading law with them. John C. Hammond and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to law practice in the county seat of Hampshire County, Massachusetts. In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, becoming a country lawyer. With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge opened his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.\nMarriage and family.\nIn 1903, Coolidge met Grace Anna Goodhue, a University of Vermont graduate and teacher at Northampton's Clarke School for the Deaf. They married on October 4, 1905 at 2:30\u00a0p.m. in a small ceremony which took place in the parlor of Grace's family's house, having overcome his future mother-in-law's objections to the marriage. The newlyweds went on a honeymoon trip to Montreal, originally planned for two weeks but cut short by a week at Coolidge's request. After 25 years he wrote of Grace, \"for almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities and I have rejoiced in her graces\".\nThe Coolidges had two sons: John (September 7, 1906 \u2013 May 31, 2000) and Calvin Jr. (April 13, 1908 \u2013 July 7, 1924). Calvin Jr. died at age 16 from blood poisoning. On June 30, 1924 Calvin Jr. had played tennis with his brother on the White House tennis courts without putting on socks and developed a blister on one of his toes. The blister subsequently degenerated into sepsis and Calvin Jr. died a little over a week later. The President never forgave himself for Calvin Jr's death. His eldest John said it \"hurt [Coolidge] terribly.\" John became a railroad executive, helped to start the Coolidge Foundation, and was instrumental in creating the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site.\nCoolidge was frugal, and when it came to securing a home, he insisted upon renting. He and his wife attended Northampton's Edwards Congregational Church before and after his presidency.\nLocal political office (1898\u22121915).\nCity offices.\nThe Republican Party was dominant in New England at the time, and Coolidge followed the example of Hammond and Field by becoming active in local politics. In 1896, Coolidge campaigned for Republican presidential candidate William McKinley, and the next year he was selected to be a member of the Republican City Committee. In 1898, he won election to the City Council of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected. The position offered no salary but provided Coolidge invaluable political experience. In 1899, he declined renomination, running instead for City Solicitor, a position elected by the City Council. He was elected for a one-year term in 1900, and reelected in 1901. This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer and paid a salary of $600 (). In 1902, the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to private practice. Soon thereafter, however, the clerk of courts for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The position paid well, but it barred him from practicing law, so he remained at the job for only one-year. In 1904, Coolidge suffered his sole defeat at the ballot box, losing an election to the Northampton school board. When told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern, the recently married Coolidge replied, \"Might give me time!\"\nMassachusetts state legislator and mayor.\nIn 1906, the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He won a close victory over the incumbent Democrat, and reported to Boston for the 1907 session of the Massachusetts General Court. In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, was known as a Progressive Republican, voting in favor of such measures as women's suffrage and the direct election of Senators. While in Boston, Coolidge became an ally, and then a liegeman, of then U.S. Senator Winthrop Murray Crane who controlled the western faction of the Massachusetts Republican Party; Crane's party rival in the east of the commonwealth was U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. Coolidge forged another key strategic alliance with Guy Currier, who had served in both state houses and had the social distinction, wealth, personal charm and broad circle of friends which Coolidge lacked, and which would have a lasting impact on his political career. In 1907, he was elected to a second term, and in the 1908 session Coolidge was more outspoken, though not in a leadership position.\nInstead of vying for another term in the State House, Coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for mayor of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired. He was well liked in the town, and defeated his challenger by a vote of 1,597 to 1,409. During his first term (1910 to 1911), he increased teachers' salaries and retired some of the city's debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease. He was renominated in 1911, and defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin.\nIn 1911, the State Senator for the Hampshire County area retired and successfully encouraged Coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session; Coolidge defeated his Democratic opponent by a large margin. At the start of that term, he became chairman of a committee to arbitrate the \"Bread and Roses\" strike by the workers of the American Woolen Company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' demands, in a settlement proposed by the committee. A major issue affecting Massachusetts Republicans that year was the party split between the progressive wing, which favored Theodore Roosevelt, and the conservative wing, which favored William Howard Taft. Although he favored some progressive measures, Coolidge refused to leave the Republican party. When the new Progressive Party declined to run a candidate in his state senate district, Coolidge won reelection against his Democratic opponent by an increased margin.\nIn the 1913 session, Coolidge enjoyed renowned success in arduously navigating to passage the Western Trolley Act, which connected Northampton with a dozen similar industrial communities in western Massachusetts. Coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom, but when the president of the state senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for lieutenant governor, Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate in the hopes of being elected as its presiding officer. Although Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women's suffrage; Coolidge was in favor of the women's vote, won his own re-election and with Crane's help, assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate. After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled \"Have Faith in Massachusetts\", which summarized his philosophy of government.\nCoolidge's speech was well received, and he attracted some admirers on its account; towards the end of the term, many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be President of the Senate. Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns, encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor. Stearns, an executive with the Boston department store R. H. Stearns, became another key ally, and began a publicity campaign on Coolidge's behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session.\nLieutenant Governor and Governor of Massachusetts (1916\u22121921).\nCoolidge entered the primary election for lieutenant governor and was nominated to run alongside gubernatorial candidate Samuel W. McCall. Coolidge was the leading vote-getter in the Republican primary, and balanced the Republican ticket by adding a western presence to McCall's eastern base of support. McCall and Coolidge won the 1915 election to their respective one-year terms, with Coolidge defeating his opponent by more than 50,000 votes.\nIn Massachusetts, the lieutenant governor does not preside over the state Senate, as is the case in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.\n1918 election.\nCoolidge was unopposed for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, ran on the previous administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in World War I. The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among Irish and German Americans. Coolidge was elected by a margin of 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.\nBoston Police Strike.\nIn 1919, in reaction to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle \u2013 that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city. Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others, called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty.\nCoolidge, sensing the severity of circumstances were then in need of his intervention, conferred with Crane's operative, William Butler, and then acted. He called up more units of the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the police force. Curtis proclaimed that all of the strikers were fired from their jobs, and Coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited.\nThat night Coolidge received a telegram from AFL leader Samuel Gompers. \"Whatever disorder has occurred\", Gompers wrote, \"is due to Curtis's order in which the right of the policemen has been denied\u2026\" Coolidge publicly answered Gompers's telegram, denying any justification whatsoever for the strike \u2013 and his response launched him into the national consciousness. Newspapers across the nation picked up on Coolidge's statement and he became the newest hero to opponents of the strike. In the midst of the First Red Scare, many Americans were terrified of the spread of communist revolution, like those that had taken place in Russia, Hungary, and Germany. While Coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor, conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star. Although he usually acted with deliberation, the Boston police strike gave him a national reputation as a decisive leader, and as a strict enforcer of law and order.\n1919 election.\nCoolidge and Cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his actions in the Police Strike around the state and the nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form. He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier. His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge run for president in 1920.\nLegislation and vetoes as governor.\nBy the time Coolidge was inaugurated on January 2, 1919, the First World War had ended, and Coolidge pushed the legislature to give a $100 bonus () to Massachusetts veterans. He also signed a bill reducing the work week for women and children from fifty-four hours to forty-eight, saying, \"We must humanize the industry, or the system will break down.\" He signed into law a budget that kept the tax rates the same, while trimming $4 million from expenditures, thus allowing the state to retire some of its debt.\nCoolidge also wielded the veto pen as governor. His most publicized veto prevented an increase in legislators' pay by 50%. Although Coolidge was personally opposed to Prohibition, he vetoed a bill in May 1920 that would have allowed the sale of beer or wine of 2.75% alcohol or less, in Massachusetts in violation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \"Opinions and instructions do not outmatch the Constitution,\" he said in his veto message. \"Against it, they are void.\"\nVice presidency (1921\u22121923).\n1920 election.\nAt the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of the delegates were selected by state party caucuses, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. When the time came to select a vice presidential nominee, the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted \u2013 Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin \u2013 and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision. A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read \"Have Faith in Massachusetts\", proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.\nThe Democrats nominated another Ohioan, James M. Cox, for president and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, for vice president. The question of the United States joining the League of Nations was a major issue in the campaign, as was the unfinished legacy of Progressivism. Harding ran a \"front-porch\" campaign from his home in Marion, Ohio, but Coolidge took to the campaign trail in the Upper South, New York, and New England \u2013 his audiences carefully limited to those familiar with Coolidge and those placing a premium upon concise and short speeches. On November 2, 1920, Harding and Coolidge were victorious in a landslide, winning more than 60 percent of the popular vote, including every state outside the South. They also won in Tennessee, the first time a Republican ticket had won a Southern state since Reconstruction.\n\"Silent Cal\".\nThe U.S. vice-presidency did not carry many official duties, but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings, making him the first vice president to do so. He gave a number of unremarkable speeches around the country.\nAs vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace were invited to quite a few parties, where the legend of \"Silent Cal\" was born. It is from this time that most of the jokes and anecdotes involving Coolidge originate, such as Coolidge being \"silent in five languages\". Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private he was a man of few words and was commonly referred to as \"Silent Cal\". An apocryphal story has it that a person seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, \"I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you.\" He replied, \"You lose.\" However, on April 22, 1923, Coolidge himself said that the \"You lose\" quotation never occurred. The story about it was related by Frank B. Noyes, President of the Associated Press, to their membership at their annual luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, when toasting and introducing Coolidge, who was the invited speaker. After the introduction and before his prepared remarks, Coolidge said to the membership, \"Your President [referring to Noyes] has given you a perfect example of one of those rumors now current in Washington which is without any foundation.\" Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, \"How can they tell?\" Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, \"Got to eat somewhere.\" Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: \"When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, folded his arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle.\"\nAs president, Coolidge's reputation as a quiet man continued. \"The words of a President have an enormous weight,\" he would later write, \"and ought not to be used indiscriminately.\" Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. \"I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President,\" he once told Ethel Barrymore, \"and I think I will go along with them.\" Some historians suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic, while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening after the death of his son in 1924.\nPresidency (1923\u22121929).\nOn August 2, 1923, President Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack in San Francisco while on a speaking tour of the western United States. Vice President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his family home, which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he received word by messenger of Harding's death. The \"new\" president dressed, said a prayer, and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled. His father, a notary public and justice of the peace, administered the oath of office in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47\u00a0a.m. on August 3, 1923; and Coolidge then returned to bed as president.\nCoolidge returned to Washington the next day, and was sworn in again by Justice Adolph A. Hoehling Jr. of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, to forestall any questions about the authority of a state official to administer a federal oath. This second oath-taking remained a secret until it was revealed by Harry M. Daugherty in 1932, and confirmed by Hoehling. When Hoehling confirmed Daugherty's story, he indicated that Daugherty, then serving as United States Attorney General, asked him to administer the oath without fanfare at the Willard Hotel. According to Hoehling, he did not question Daugherty's reason for requesting a second oath-taking but assumed it was to resolve any doubt about whether the first swearing-in was valid.\nThe nation initially did not know what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.\nCoolidge addressed Congress when it reconvened on December 6, 1923, giving a speech that supported many of Harding's policies, including Harding's formal budgeting process, the enforcement of immigration restrictions and arbitration of coal strikes ongoing in Pennsylvania. Coolidge's speech was the first presidential speech to be broadcast over the radio. The Washington Naval Treaty was proclaimed just one month into Coolidge's term, and was generally well received in the country. In May 1924, the World War I veterans' World War Adjusted Compensation Act or \"Bonus Bill\" was passed over his veto. Coolidge signed the Immigration Act later that year, which was aimed at restricting southern and eastern European immigration, but appended a signing statement expressing his unhappiness with the bill's specific exclusion of Japanese immigrants. Just before the Republican Convention began, Coolidge signed into law the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced the top marginal tax rate from 58% to 46%, as well as personal income tax rates across the board, increased the estate tax and bolstered it with a new gift tax.\nOn June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the act granting citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States. By that time, two-thirds of the people were already citizens, having gained it through marriage, military service (veterans of World War I were granted citizenship in 1919), or the land allotments that had earlier taken place.\n1924 election.\nThe Republican Convention was held on June 10\u201312, 1924, in Cleveland, Ohio; Coolidge was nominated on the first ballot. The convention nominated Frank Lowden of Illinois for vice president on the second ballot, but he declined; former Brigadier General Charles G. Dawes was nominated on the third ballot and accepted.\nThe Democrats held their convention the next month in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP to form a new Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.\nAfter the conventions and the death of his younger son Calvin, Coolidge became withdrawn; he later said that \"when he [the son] died, the power and glory of the Presidency went with him.\" Even as he mourned, Coolidge ran his standard campaign, not mentioning his opponents by name or maligning them, and delivering speeches on his theory of government, including several that were broadcast over the radio. It was the most subdued campaign since 1896, partly because of Coolidge's grief, but also because of his naturally non-confrontational style. The other candidates campaigned in a more modern fashion, but despite the split in the Republican party, the results were similar to those of 1920. Coolidge and Dawes won every state outside the South except Wisconsin, La Follette's home state. Coolidge won the election with 382 electoral votes and the popular vote by 2.5\u00a0million over his opponents' combined total.\nIndustry and trade.\nDuring Coolidge's presidency, the United States experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the \"Roaring Twenties.\" He left the administration's industrial policy in the hands of his activist Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, who energetically used government auspices to promote business efficiency and develop airlines and radio. Coolidge disdained regulation and demonstrated this by appointing commissioners to the Federal Trade Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission who did little to restrict the activities of businesses under their jurisdiction. The regulatory state under Coolidge was, as one biographer described it, \"thin to the point of invisibility.\"\nHistorian Robert Sobel offers some context of Coolidge's laissez-faire ideology, based on the prevailing understanding of federalism during his presidency: \"As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards. Did he support these measures while president? No, because in the 1920s, such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments.\"\nTaxation and government spending.\nCoolidge adopted the taxation policies of his Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, who advocated \"scientific taxation\" \u2014 the notion that lowering taxes will increase, rather than decrease, government receipts. Congress agreed, and tax rates were reduced in Coolidge's term. In addition to federal tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring of the federal debt. Coolidge's ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people. They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt. By 1927, only the wealthiest 2% of taxpayers paid any federal income tax. Federal spending remained flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt to be retired in total. State and local governments saw considerable growth, however, surpassing the federal budget in 1927. By 1929, after Coolidge's series of tax rate reductions had cut the tax rate to 24 percent on those making over $100,000, the federal government collected more than a billion dollars in income taxes, of which 65 percent was collected from those making over $100,000. In 1921, when the tax rate on people making over $100,000 a year was 73 percent, the federal government collected a little over $700 million in income taxes, of which 30 percent was paid by those making over $100,000.\nOpposition to farm subsidies.\nPerhaps the most contentious issue of Coolidge's presidency was relief for farmers. Some in Congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling agricultural prices by allowing the federal government to purchase crops to sell abroad at lower prices. Agriculture Secretary Henry C. Wallace and other administration officials favored the bill when it was introduced in 1924, but rising prices convinced many in Congress that the bill was unnecessary, and it was defeated just before the elections that year. In 1926, with farm prices falling once more, Senator Charles L. McNary and Representative Gilbert N. Haugen\u2014both Republicans\u2014proposed the McNary\u2013Haugen Farm Relief Bill. The bill proposed a federal farm board that would purchase surplus production in high-yield years and hold it (when feasible) for later sale or sell it abroad. Coolidge opposed McNary-Haugen, declaring that agriculture must stand \"on an independent business basis,\" and said that \"government control cannot be divorced from political control.\" Instead of manipulating prices, he favored instead Herbert Hoover's proposal to increase profitability by modernizing agriculture. Secretary Mellon wrote a letter denouncing the McNary-Haugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation, and it was defeated.\nAfter McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge supported a less radical measure, the Curtis-Crisp Act, which would have created a federal board to lend money to farm co-operatives in times of surplus; the bill did not pass. In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it. In his veto message, he expressed the belief that the bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy. Congress did not override the veto, but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it. \"Farmers never have made much money,\" said Coolidge, the Vermont farmer's son. \"I do not believe we can do much about it.\"\nFlood control.\nCoolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural disaster to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed a lack of interest in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, and that it would be seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.\nCivil rights.\nAccording to one biographer, Coolidge was \"devoid of racial prejudice,\" but rarely took the lead on civil rights. Coolidge disliked the Ku Klux Klan and no Klansman is known to have received an appointment from him. In the 1924 presidential election his opponents (Robert La Follette and John Davis), and his running mate Charles Dawes, often attacked the Klan but Coolidge avoided the subject.\nCoolidge spoke in favor of the civil rights of African-Americans, saying in his first State of the Union address that their rights were \"just as sacred as those of any other citizen\" under the U.S. Constitution and that it was a \"public and a private duty to protect those rights.\"\nCoolidge repeatedly called for laws to make lynching a federal crime (it was already a state crime, though not always enforced). Congress refused to pass any such legislation. On June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act, which granted U.S. citizenship to all American Indians living on reservations. (Those off reservations had long been citizens.) On June 6, 1924, Coolidge delivered a commencement address at historically black, non-segregated Howard University, in which he thanked and commended African-Americans for their rapid advances in education and their contributions to U.S. society over the years, as well as their eagerness to render their services as soldiers in the World War, all while being faced with discrimination and prejudices at home.\nIn a speech in October 1924, Coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an American value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to U.S. society, saying that they have \"contributed much to making our country what it is.\" He stated that although the diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in Europe, it was peculiar for the United States that it was a \"harmonious\" benefit for the country. Coolidge further stated the United States should assist and help immigrants who come to the country and urged immigrants to reject \"race hatreds\" and \"prejudices\".\nForeign policy.\nCoolidge was neither well versed in nor very interested in world affairs. His focus was directed mainly at American business, especially pertaining to trade, and \"Maintaining the Status Quo.\" Although not an isolationist, he was reluctant to enter into foreign alliances. While Coolidge believed strongly in a non-interventionist foreign policy, he did believe that America was exceptional.\nCoolidge considered the 1920 Republican victory as a rejection of the Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate U.S. membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act and so the United States did not join the World Court.\nCoolidge authorized the Dawes Plan, a financial plan by Charles Dawes, to provide Germany partial relief from its reparations obligations from World War I. The plan initially provided stimulus for the German economy. Additionally, Coolidge attempted to pursue further curbs on naval strength following the early successes of Harding's Washington Naval Conference by sponsoring the Geneva Naval Conference in 1927, which failed owing to a French and Italian boycott and ultimate failure of Great Britain and the United States to agree on cruiser tonnages. As a result, the conference was a failure and Congress eventually authorized for increased American naval spending in 1928. The Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact of 1928, named for Coolidge's Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, and French foreign minister Aristide Briand, was also a key peacekeeping initiative. The treaty, ratified in 1929, committed signatories\u2014the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan\u2014to \"renounce war, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.\" The treaty did not achieve its intended result\u2014the outlawry of war\u2014but it did provide the founding principle for international law after World War II. Coolidge also continued the previous administration's policy of withholding recognition of the Soviet Union.\nEfforts were made to normalize ties with post-Revolution Mexico. Coolidge recognized Mexico's new governments under \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n and Plutarco El\u00edas Calles, and continued American support for the elected Mexican government against the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty during the Cristero War, lifting the arms embargo on that country; he also appointed Dwight Morrow as Ambassador to Mexico with the successful objective to avoid further American conflict with Mexico.\nCoolidge's administration would see continuity in the occupation of Nicaragua and Haiti, and an end to the occupation of the Dominican Republic in 1924 as a result of withdrawal agreements finalized during Harding's administration. In 1925, Coolidge ordered the withdrawal of Marines stationed in Nicaragua following perceived stability after the 1924 Nicaraguan general election, but redeployed them there in January 1927 following failed attempts to peacefully resolve the rapid deterioration of political stability and avert the ensuing Constitutionalist War; Henry L. Stimson was later sent by Coolidge to mediate a peace deal that would end the civil war and extend American military presence in Nicaragua beyond Coolidge's term in office.\nTo extend an olive branch to Latin American leaders embittered over America's interventionist policies in Central America and the Caribbean, Coolidge led the U.S. delegation to the Sixth International Conference of American States, January 15\u201317, 1928, in Havana, Cuba, the only international trip Coolidge made during his presidency. He would be the last sitting American president to visit Cuba until Barack Obama in 2016.\nFor Canada, Coolidge authorized the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of locks and canals that would provide large vessels passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes.\nCabinet.\nAlthough a few of Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge initially retained all of them, out of an ardent conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election. He kept Harding's able speechwriter Judson T. Welliver; Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925. Coolidge appointed C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal politician, to work jointly with Edward T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President (a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff).\nPerhaps the most powerful person in Coolidge's Cabinet was Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, who controlled the administration's financial policies and was regarded by many, including House Minority Leader John Nance Garner, as more powerful than Coolidge himself. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover also held a prominent place in Coolidge's Cabinet, in part because Coolidge found value in Hoover's ability to win positive publicity with his pro-business proposals. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes directed Coolidge's foreign policy until he resigned in 1925 following Coolidge's re-election. He was replaced by Frank B. Kellogg, who had previously served as a Senator and as the ambassador to Great Britain. Coolidge made two other appointments following his re-election, with William M. Jardine taking the position of Secretary of Agriculture and John G. Sargent becoming Attorney General. Coolidge did not have a vice president during his first term, but Charles Dawes became vice president during Coolidge's second term, and Dawes and Coolidge clashed over farm policy and other issues.\nJudicial appointments.\nCoolidge appointed one justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan F. Stone in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty. It does not appear that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than Stone, although Stone himself had urged Coolidge to appoint Benjamin N. Cardozo. Stone proved to be a firm believer in judicial restraint and was regarded as one of the court's three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt later appointed Stone to be chief justice.\nCoolidge nominated 17 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals and 61 judges to the United States district courts. He appointed judges to various specialty courts as well, including Genevieve R. Cline, who became the first woman named to the federal judiciary when Coolidge placed her on the United States Customs Court in 1928. Coolidge also signed the Judiciary Act of 1925 into law, allowing the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload.\n1928 election.\nIn the summer of 1927, Coolidge vacationed in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where he engaged in horseback riding and fly fishing and attended rodeos. He made Custer State Park his \"summer White House.\" While on vacation, Coolidge surprisingly issued a terse statement that he would not seek a second full term as president: \"I do not choose to run for President in 1928.\" After allowing the reporters to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. \"If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933\u00a0\u2026 Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it\u2014too long!\" In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: \"The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish.\" After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 with a landslide by Herbert Hoover. Coolidge had been reluctant to endorse Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that \"for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice\u2014all of it bad.\" Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary.\nRetirement and death (1929\u20131933).\nAfter his presidency, Coolidge retired to a modest rented house on residential Massasoit Street in Northampton before moving to a more spacious home, \"The Beeches.\" He kept a Hacker runabout boat on the Connecticut River and was often observed on the water by local boating enthusiasts. During this period, he also served as chairman of the Non-Partisan Railroad Commission, an entity created by several banks and corporations to survey the country's long-term transportation needs and make recommendations for improvements. He was an honorary president of the American Foundation for the Blind, a director of New York Life Insurance Company, president of the American Antiquarian Society, and a trustee of Amherst College.\nCoolidge published his autobiography in 1929 and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, \"Calvin Coolidge Says,\" from 1930 to 1931. Faced with looming defeat in the 1932 presidential election, some Republicans spoke of rejecting Herbert Hoover as their party's nominee, and instead drafting Coolidge to run, but the former president made it clear that he was not interested in running again, and that he would publicly repudiate any effort to draft him, should it come about. Hoover was renominated, and Coolidge made several radio addresses in support of him. Hoover then lost the general election to Coolidge's 1920 vice presidential Democratic opponent Franklin D. Roosevelt in a landslide.\nCoolidge died suddenly from coronary thrombosis at \"The Beeches,\" at 12:45\u00a0p.m., January 5, 1933. Shortly before his death, Coolidge confided to an old friend: \"I feel I no longer fit in with these times.\" Coolidge is buried in Plymouth Notch Cemetery, Plymouth Notch, Vermont. The nearby family home is maintained as one of the original buildings on the Calvin Coolidge Homestead District site. The State of Vermont dedicated a new visitors' center nearby to mark Coolidge's 100th birthday on July 4, 1972.\nRadio, film, and commemorations.\nDespite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since. Coolidge's second inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, his speech to Congress was broadcast on radio, the first presidential radio address. Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created Federal Radio Commission. On August 11, 1924, Theodore W. Case, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process he developed for Lee de Forest, filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making \"Silent Cal\" the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was \"President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds\". When Charles Lindbergh arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and presented him with the Medal of Honor; the event was captured on film."}

The convention has three main goals: the conservation of biological diversity (or biodiversity); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources. Its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and it is often seen as the key document regarding sustainable development.\nThe convention was opened for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993. It has two supplementary agreements, the Cartagena Protocol and Nagoya Protocol.\nThe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is an international treaty governing the movements of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from modern biotechnology from one country to another. It was adopted on 29 January 2000 as a supplementary agreement to the CBD and entered into force on 11 September 2003.\nThe Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) to the Convention on Biological Diversity is another supplementary agreement to the CBD. It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Nagoya Protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan and entered into force on 12 October 2014.\n2010 was also the International Year of Biodiversity, and the Secretariat of the CBD was its focal point. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories at Nagoya, the UN declared 2011 to 2020 as the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity in December 2010. The convention's \"Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020\", created in 2010, include the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\nThe meetings of the parties to the convention are known as Conferences of the Parties (COP), with the first one (COP 1) held in Nassau, Bahamas in 1994 and the most recent one (COP 14) held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.\nOrigin and scope.\nThe notion of an international convention on bio-diversity was conceived at a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988. The subsequent year, the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts was established for the drafting of a legal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization with sovereign states and local communities.\nIn 1991, an intergovernmental negotiating committee was established, tasked with finalizing the convention's text.\nA Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992, and its conclusions were distilled in the Nairobi Final Act. The convention's text was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio \"Earth Summit\"). By its closing date, 4 June 1993, the convention had received 168 signatures. It entered into force on 29 December 1993.\nThe convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biodiversity is \"a common concern of humankind\" and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use. It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and biosafety issues. Importantly, the convention is legally binding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its provisions.\nThe convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use. While past conservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.\nThe convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary principle which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 banned some forms of geoengineering.\nExecutive secretary.\nThe current acting executive secretary is Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, who took up this post on 1 December 2019.\nThe previous executive secretaries were:\nCristiana Pa\u0219ca Palmer (2017\u20132019), Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias (2012\u20132017), Ahmed Djoghlaf (2006\u20132012), Hamdallah Zedan (1998\u20132005), Calestous Juma (1995\u20131998), and Angela Cropper (1993\u20131995).\nIssues.\nSome of the many issues dealt with under the convention include:\nInternational bodies established.\nConference of the Parties (COP).\nThe convention's governing body is the Conference of the Parties (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.\nThe Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, the main organs are:\nCBD Secretariat.\nThe CBD Secretariat, based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, operates under UNEP, the United Nations Environment Programme. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information.\nSubsidiary Body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA).\nThe SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues. It provides assessments of the status of biological diversity and of various measures taken in accordance with Convention, and also gives recommendations to the Conference of the Parties, which may be endorsed in whole, in part or in modified form by the COPs. SBSTTA had met 23 times, with a 24th meeting scheduled to take place in Canada in 2021.\nSubsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI).\nIn 2014, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity established the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI) to replace the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Review of Implementation of the convention. The four functions and core areas of work of SBI are: (a) review of progress in implementation; (b) strategic actions to enhance implementation; (c) strengthening means of implementation; and (d) operations of the convention and the Protocols. The first meeting of the SBI was held on 2\u20136 May 2016 and the second meeting was held on 9\u201313 July 2018, both in Montreal, Canada. The third meeting of the SBI will be held on 25\u201329 May 2020 in Montreal, Canada. The Bureau of the Conference of the Parties serves as the Bureau of the SBI. The current chair of the SBI is Ms. Charlotta S\u00f6rqvist of Sweden.\nParties.\nAs of 2016, the convention has 196 parties, which includes 195 states and the European Union. All UN member states\u2014with the exception of the United States\u2014have ratified the treaty. Non-UN member states that have ratified are the Cook Islands, Niue, and the State of Palestine. The Holy See and the states with limited recognition are non-parties. The US has signed but not ratified the treaty, and has not announced plans to ratify it.\nThe European Union created the Cartagena Protocol (see below) in 2000 to enhance biosafety regulation and propagate the \"precautionary principle\" over the \"sound science principle\" defended by the United States. Whereas the impact of the Cartagena Protocol on domestic regulations has been substantial, its impact on international trade law remains uncertain. In 2006, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that the European Union had violated international trade law between 1999 and 2003 by imposing a moratorium on the approval of genetically modified organisms (GMO) imports. Disappointing the United States, the panel nevertheless \"decided not to decide\" by not invalidating the stringent European biosafety regulations.\nImplementation by the parties to the convention is achieved using two means:\nNational Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP).\nNational Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention at the national level. The Convention requires that countries prepare a national biodiversity strategy and to ensure that this strategy is included in planning for activities in all sectors where diversity may be impacted. As of early 2012, 173 Parties had developed NBSAPs.\nThe United Kingdom, New Zealand and Tanzania carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats. The United States of America, a signatory who had not yet ratified the treaty by 2010, produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species recovery programs and other mechanisms long in place in the US for species conservation.\nSingapore established a detailed \"National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan\". The \"National Biodiversity Centre\" of Singapore represents Singapore in the Convention for Biological Diversity.\nNational Reports.\nIn accordance with Article 26 of the convention, parties prepare national reports on the status of implementation of the convention.\nProtocols and plans developed by CBD.\nCartagena Protocol (2000).\nThe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000, after a CBD Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on Biosafety had met six times between July 1996 and February 1999. The Working Group submitted a draft text of the Protocol, for consideration by Conference of the Parties at its first extraordinary meeting, which was convened for the express purpose of adopting a protocol on biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity. After a few delays, the Cartagena Protocol was eventually adopted on 29 January 2000 The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.\nThe Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the precautionary principle and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will for example let countries ban imports of a genetically modified organism if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically modified commodities such as corn or cotton.\nThe required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.\nGlobal Strategy for Plant Conservation (2002).\nIn April 2002, the parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.\nNagoya Protocol (2010).\nThe Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, and entered into force on 12 October 2014. The protocol is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity, and provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. It thereby contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.\n\"Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020\".\nAlso at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, held from 18 to 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, a revised and updated \"Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, 2011-2020\" was agreed and published. This document included the \"Aichi Biodiversity Targets\", comprising 20 targets which address each of five strategic goals defined in the Strategic Plan. The strategic plan includes the following strategic goals:\nCriticism.\nThere have been criticisms against CBD that the convention has been weakened in implementation due to the resistance of Western countries to the implementation of the pro-South provisions of the convention. CBD is also regarded as a case of a hard treaty gone soft in the implementation trajectory. The argument to enforce the treaty as a legally binding multilateral instrument with the Conference of Parties reviewing the infractions and non-compliance is also gaining strength.\nAlthough the convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions, examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening. The fifth report of the European Union, for example, makes frequent reference to animals (particularly fish) and plants, but does not mention bacteria, fungi or protists at all. The International Society for Fungal Conservation has assessed more than 100 of these CBD documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories. No documents were assessed as good or adequate, less than 10% as nearly adequate or poor, and the rest as deficient, seriously deficient or totally deficient.\nScientists working with biodiversity and medical research are expressing fears that the Nagoya Protocol is counterproductive, and will hamper disease prevention and conservation efforts, and that the threat of imprisonment of scientists will have a chilling effect on research. Non-commercial researchers and institutions such as natural history museums fear maintaining biological reference collections and exchanging material between institutions will become difficult, and medical researchers have expressed alarm at plans to expand the protocol to make it illegal to publicly share genetic information, e.g. via GenBank.\nWilliam Yancey Brown when with the Brookings Institution has suggested that the Convention on Biological Diversity should include the preservation of intact genomes and viable cells for every known species and for new species as they are discovered.\nMeetings of the parties.\nA Conference of the Parties (COP) was held annually for three years after 1994, and thence biennially on even-numbered years.\n1994 COP 1.\nThe first ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in November and December 1994, in Nassau, Bahamas.\n1995 COP 2.\nThe second ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in November 1995, in Jakarta, Indonesia.\n1996 COP 3.\nThe third ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in November 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n1998 COP 4.\nThe fourth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in May 1998, in Bratislava, Slovakia.\n1999 EX-COP 1 (Cartagena).\nThe First Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference of the Parties took place in February 1999, in Cartagena, Colombia. A series of meetings led to the adoption of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in January 2000, effective from 2003.\n2000 COP 5.\nThe fifth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in May 2000, in Nairobi, Kenya.\n2002 COP 6.\nThe sixth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in April 2002, in The Hague, Netherlands.\n2004 COP 7.\nThe seventh ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in February 2004, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n2006 COP 8.\nThe eighth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in March 2006, in Curitiba, Brazil.\n2008 COP 9.\nThe ninth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in May 2008, in Bonn, Germany.\n2010 COP 10 (Nagoya).\nThe tenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in October 2010, in Nagoya, Japan. It was at this meeting that the Nagoya Protocol was ratified.\n2010 was the International Year of Biodiversity and the Secretariat of the CBD was its focal point. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories during COP 10 at Nagoya, the UN, on 22 December 2010, declared 2011 to 2020 as the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity.\n2012 COP 11.\nLeading up to the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) meeting on biodiversity in Hyderabad, India 2012, preparations for a World Wide Views on Biodiversity has begun, involving old and new partners and building on the experiences from the World Wide Views on Global Warming.\n2014 COP 12.\nUnder the theme, \"Biodiversity for Sustainable Development,\" thousands of representatives of governments, NGOs, indigenous peoples, scientists and the private sector gathered in Pyeongchang, Republic of Korea in October 2014 for the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 12).\nFrom 6\u201317 October 2014, Parties discussed the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which are to be achieved by the end of this decade. The results of Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, the flagship assessment report of the CBD informed the discussions.\nThe conference gave a mid-term evaluation to the UN Decade on Biodiversity (2011\u20132020) initiative, which aims to promote the conservation and sustainable use of nature. The meeting achieved a total of 35 decisions, including a decision on \"Mainstreaming gender considerations\", to incorporate gender perspective to the analysis of biodiversity. \nAt the end of the meeting, the meeting adopted the \"Pyeongchang Road Map,\" which addresses ways to achieve biodiversity through technology cooperation, funding and strengthening the capacity of developing countries.\n2016 COP 13.\nThe thirteenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place between 2 and 17 December 2016 in Cancun, Mexico.\n2018 COP 14.\nThe 14th ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place on 17\u201329 November 2018, in \nSharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The 2018 UN Biodiversity Conference closed on 29 November 2018 with broad international agreement on reversing the global destruction of nature and biodiversity loss threatening all forms of life on Earth. Parties adopted the Voluntary Guidelines for the design and effective implementation of ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Governments also agreed to accelerate action to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, agreed in 2010, until 2020. Work to achieve these targets would take place at the global, regional, national and subnational levels.\n2021 COP 15.\nThe 15th meeting of the parties is due to take place in the second quarter of 2021 in Kunming, China. It is intended that the meeting \"will adopt a post-2020 global biodiversity framework as a stepping stone towards the 2050 Vision of 'Living in harmony with nature'.\"\nReferences.\n\"This article is partly based on the relevant entry in the CIA World Factbook, edition.\"\nFurther reading.\nThere are indeed several comprehensive publications on the subject, the given reference covers only one small aspect"}

{"id": "6201", "revid": "14462949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6201", "title": "CITES", "text": "CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also known as the Washington Convention) is a multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals. It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973 and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975.\nIts aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild, and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000 species of animals and plants. In order to ensure that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.\n, Secretary-General of the CITES Secretariat is Ivonne Higuero.\nBackground and operation.\nCITES is one of the largest and oldest conservation and sustainable use agreements in existence. Participation is voluntary, and countries that have agreed to be bound by the convention are known as Parties. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties, it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework respected by each Party, which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement CITES at the national level. Often, domestic legislation is either non-existent (especially in Parties that have not ratified it), or with penalties with the gravity of the crime and insufficient deterrents to wildlife traders. As of 2002, 50% of Parties lacked one or more of the four major requirements for a Party: designation of Management and Scientific Authorities; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of CITES; penalties for such trade; laws providing for the confiscation of specimens.\nFunding for the activities of the Secretariat and Conference of the Parties (CoP) meetings comes from a Trust Fund derived from Party contributions. Trust Fund money is not available to Parties to improve implementation or compliance. These activities, and all those outside Secretariat activities (training, species specific programmes such as Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants \u2013 MIKE) must find external funding, mostly from donor countries and regional organizations such as the European Union.\nAlthough the Convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance, 36 years of CITES in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by Parties. The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties. The Secretariat will give the Party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions. Other actions the Convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent COP resolutions may be taken against the offending Party. These include:\nBilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation (e.g. the USA used certification under the Pelly Amendment to get Japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in 1991, thus reducing the volume of its exports).\nInfractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing, excessive trade, lax enforcement, and failing to produce annual reports (the most common).\nOriginally, CITES addressed depletion resulting from demand for luxury goods such as furs in Western countries, but with the rising wealth of Asia, particularly in China, the focus changed to products demanded there, particularly those used for luxury goods such as ivory or shark fins or for superstitious purposes such as rhinoceros horn. As of 2013 the demand was massive and had expanded to include thousands of species previously considered unremarkable and in no danger of extinction such as manta rays or pangolins.\nRatifications.\nThe text of the convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in Washington, D.C., United States, on 3 March 1973. It was then open for signature until 31 December 1974. It entered into force after the 10th ratification by a signatory country, on 1 July 1975. Countries that signed the Convention become Parties by ratifying, accepting or approving it. By the end of 2003, all signatory countries had become Parties. States that were not signatories may become Parties by acceding to the convention. As of October 2016, the convention has 183 parties, including 182 states and the European Union.\nThe CITES Convention includes provisions and rules for trade with non-Parties. All member states of the United Nations are party to the treaty, with the exception of Andorra, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Federated States of Micronesia, Haiti, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, South Sudan, East Timor, Turkmenistan, and Tuvalu. UN observer the Holy See is also not a member. The Faroe Islands, an autonomous country in the Kingdom of Denmark, is also treated as a non-Party to CITES (both the Danish mainland and Greenland are part of CITES).\nAn amendment to the text of the convention, known as the Gaborone Amendment allows regional economic integration organizations (REIO), such as the European Union, to have the status of a member state and to be a Party to the convention. The REIO can vote at CITES meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the REIO, but it does not have an additional vote.\nIn accordance with Article XVII, paragraph 3, of the CITES Convention, the Gaborone Amendment entered into force on 29 November 2013, 60 days after 54 (two-thirds) of the 80 States that were party to CITES on 30 April 1983 deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment. At that time it entered into force only for those States that had accepted the amendment. The amended text of the convention will apply automatically to any State that becomes a Party after 29 November 2013. For States that became party to the convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment, it will enter into force 60 days after they accept it.\nRegulation of trade.\nCITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls. All import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the convention has to be authorized through a licensing system. According to Article IX of the convention, Management and Scientific Authorities, each Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering that licensing system and one or more Scientific Authorities to advise them on the effects of trade on the status of CITES-listed species.\nAppendices.\nRoughly 5,000 species of animals and 29,000 species of plants are protected by CITES against over-exploitation through international trade. Each protected species or population is included in one of three lists, called appendices (explained below). The Appendix that lists a species or population reflects the extent of the threat to it and the controls that apply to the trade.\nSpecies may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another. Some people argue that this is risky as specimens from a more protected population could be 'laundered' through the borders of a Party whose population is not as strictly protected. The African bush elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\") is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I. Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II. Listing the species over the whole of its range would prevent such 'laundering' but also restricts trade in wildlife products by range states with good management practices. There are also species that have only some populations listed in an Appendix. One example is the pronghorn (\"Antilocapra americana\"), a ruminant native to North America. Its Mexican population is listed in Appendix I, but its U.S. and Canadian populations are not listed (though certain U.S. populations in Arizona are nonetheless protected under the Endangered Species Act).\nSpecies are proposed for inclusion in or deletion from the Appendices at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which are held approximately once every three years.\nSpecies in the Appendices may be proposed for addition, change of Appendix, or de-listing (i.e., deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and changes may be made despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing. These discussions are usually among the most contentious at CoP meetings.\nThere has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations. For instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection. Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection.\nAppendix I.\nAppendix I, about 1200 species, are species that are threatened with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). Captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII). The Scientific Authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population. Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able to care for the specimen adequately.\nNotable animal species listed in Appendix I include the red panda (\"Ailurus fulgens\"), western gorilla (\"Gorilla gorilla\"), the chimpanzee species (\"Pan spp.\"), tigers (\"Panthera tigris\" subspecies), Asiatic lion (\"Panthera leo persica\"), leopards (\"Panthera pardus\"), jaguar (\"Panthera onca\"), cheetah (\"Acinonyx jubatus\"), Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\"), some populations of African bush elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\"), the dugong and manatees (Sirenia), and all rhinoceros species (except some Southern African subspecies populations).\nAppendix II.\nAppendix II, about 21,000 species, are species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild. In addition, Appendix II can include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices. International trade in specimens of Appendix II species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate. In practice, many hundreds of thousands of Appendix II animals are traded annually. No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES, although some Parties do require import permits as part of their stricter domestic measures. A non-detriment finding and export permit are required by the exporting Party.\nIn addition, Article VII of CITES states that specimens of animals listed in Appendix I that are bred in captivity for commercial purposes are treated as Appendix II. The same applies for specimens of Appendix I plants artificially propagated for commercial purposes.\nExamples of species listed on Appendix II are the great white shark (\"Carcharodon carcharias\"), the American black bear (\"Ursus americanus\"), Hartmann's mountain zebra (\"Equus zebra hartmannae\"), green iguana (\"Iguana iguana\"), queen conch (\"Strombus gigas\"), Emperor scorpion (\"Pandinus imperator\"), Mertens' water monitor (\"Varanus mertensi\"), bigleaf mahogany (\"Swietenia macrophylla\") and lignum vitae \"ironwood\" (\"Guaiacum officinale\").\nAppendix III.\nAppendix III, about 170 species, are species that are listed after one member country has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling trade in a species. The species are not necessarily threatened with extinction globally. In all member countries, trade in these species is only permitted with an appropriate export permit and a certificate of origin from the state of the member country who has listed the species.\nExamples of species listed on Appendix III and the countries that listed them are the two-toed sloth (\"Choloepus hoffmanni\") by Costa Rica, sitatunga (\"Tragelaphus spekii\") by Ghana, African civet (\"Civettictis civetta\") by Botswana, and alligator snapping turtle (\"Macrochelys temminckii\") by the USA.\nAnnex A, B, C and D.\nEuropean Union uses Annexes A, B, C and D instead of Appendixes 1, 2 and 3.\nAnnexes A, B and C are stricter versions of 1, 2 and 3 and contain more species that are protected under EU Internal Legislation.\nAnnex D, which doesn't have equivalent in CITES, is \"monitoring list\". It contains species, which import levels are monitored to determine the level of trade and any potential threat to species caused by trade.\nAmendments and reservations.\nAmendments to the Convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority who are \"present and voting\" and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the COP if one-third of the Parties are interested in such a meeting. The Gaborone Amendment (1983) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty. Reservations (Article XXIII) can be made by any Party with respect to any species, which considerably weakens the treaty (see Reservations entered by Parties CITES for current reservations). Trade with non-Party states is allowed, although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers.\nNotable reservations include those by Iceland, Japan and Norway on various baleen whale species and those on Falconiformes by Saudi Arabia.\nShortcomings and concerns.\nApproach to biodiversity conservation.\nGeneral limitations about the structure and philosophy of CITES include: by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss, ecosystem approaches to conservation, or poverty; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use (which generally conflicts with the Convention on Biological Diversity), although this has been changing (see Nile crocodile, African elephant, South African white rhino case studies in Hutton and Dickinson 2000). It does not explicitly address market demand. In fact, CITES listings have been demonstrated to increase financial speculation in certain markets for high value species. Funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement (it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature).\nDrafting.\nBy design, CITES regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a \"negative list\" such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated \"unless\" the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained. Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review. For example, recently several bird classified as threatened with extinction appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status. If a \"positive list\" approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.\nSpecific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the 'non-detriment' finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the 'household effects' clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.\nAnimal sourced pathogens.\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 CEO Ivonne Higuero noted that wildlife trade not only helps to destroy habitats, but these habitats create a safety barrier for humans that can prevent pathogens from animals passing themselves on to people.\nReform suggestions.\nSuggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the Convention on Biological Diversity) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting. CITES would benefit from access to Global Environment Facility (GEF), funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds. Development of a future mechanism similar to that of the Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.\nOn 15 July 2008, the Committee of Environmental Insecticides that oversees the administration of the convention between meetings of all the Parties granted China and Japan permission to import elephant ivory from four African government stockpiles, the ivory being sold at a single auction in each country. The amounts to be sold comprise approximately 44 tons from Botswana, 9 tons from Namibia, 51 tons from South Africa, and 4 tons from Zimbabwe. The Chinese government in 2003 acknowledged that it had lost track of 121 tons of ivory between 1991 and 2002.\nTRAFFIC Data.\nFrom 2005 to 2009 the legal trade corresponded with these numbers\nIn the 1990s the annual trade of legal animal products was $160 billion annually. In 2009 the estimated value almost doubled to $300 billion.\nAdditional information about the documented trade can be extracted through queries on the CITES website.\nMeetings.\nThe Conference of the Parties (CoP) is held once every three years. The last Conference of the Parties (CoP 18) was held in Geneva, Switzerland, 17\u201328 August 2019 and the one before it (CoP 17) was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, 2016. The next one (CoP 19) will be in San Jose, Cost Rica, in 2022. The location of the next CoP is chosen at the close of each CoP by a secret ballot vote.\nThe CITES Committees (Animals Committee, Plants Committee and Standing Committee) hold meetings during each year that does not have a CoP, while the Standing committee meets also in years with a CoP. The Committee meetings take place in Geneva, Switzerland (where the Secretariat of the CITES Convention is located), unless another country offers to host the meeting. The Secretariat is administered by UNEP. The Animals and Plants Committees have sometimes held joint meetings. The previous joint meeting was held in March 2012 in Dublin, Ireland, and the latest one was held in Veracruz, Mexico, in May 2014.\nA current list of upcoming meetings appears on the CITES calendar."}

It opened for signature on 18 May 1977 in Geneva and entered into force on 5 October 1978.\nThe Convention bans weather warfare, which is the use of weather modification techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction. The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 would also ban some forms of weather modification or geoengineering.\nMany states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides in warfare, such as Agent Orange, but it does require case-by-case consideration.\nParties.\nThe Convention was signed by 48 states; 16 of the signatories have not ratified. As of January 2018, the Convention has 78 state parties.\nHistory.\nThe problem of artificial modification of the environment for military or other hostile purposes was brought to the international agenda in the early 1970s. Following the US decision of July 1972 to renounce the use of climate modification techniques for hostile purposes, the 1973 resolution by the US Senate calling for an international agreement \"prohibiting the use of any environmental or geophysical modification activity as a weapon of war\", and an in-depth review by the Department of Defense of the military aspects of weather and other environmental modification techniques, US decided to seek agreement with the Soviet Union to explore the possibilities of an international agreement.\nIn July 1974, US and USSR agreed to hold bilateral discussions on measures to overcome the danger of the use of environmental modification techniques for military purposes and three subsequent rounds of discussions in 1974 and 1975. In August 1975, US and USSR tabled identical draft texts of a convention at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD), Conference on Disarmament, where intensive negotiations resulted in a modified text and understandings regarding four articles of this Convention in 1976.\nThe Convention was approved by Resolution 31/72 of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1976, by 96 to 8 votes with 30 abstentions.\nEnvironmental Modification Technique.\nEnvironmental Modification Technique includes any technique for changing \u2013 through the deliberate manipulation of natural processes \u2013 the dynamics, composition or structure of the earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space.\nStructure of ENMOD.\nThe Convention contains ten articles and one Annex on the Consultative Committee of Experts. Integral part of the Convention are also the Understandings relating to articles I, II, III and VIII. These Understandings are not incorporated into the Convention but are part of the negotiating record and were included in the report transmitted by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1976 Report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, Volume I, General Assembly Official records: Thirty-first session, Supplement No. 27 (A/31/27), New York, United Nations, 1976, pp.\u00a091\u201392."}

These numbers are formed from a construction due to Gregory Chaitin.\nAlthough there are infinitely many halting probabilities, one for each method of encoding programs, it is common to use the letter \u03a9 to refer to them as if there were only one. Because \u03a9 depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called Chaitin's construction when not referring to any specific encoding.\nEach halting probability is a normal and transcendental real number that is not computable, which means that there is no algorithm to compute its digits. Each halting probability is Martin-L\u00f6f random, meaning there is not even any algorithm which can reliably guess its digits.\nBackground.\nThe definition of a halting probability relies on the existence of a prefix-free universal computable function. Such a function, intuitively, represents a programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program.\nSuppose that \"F\" is a partial function that takes one argument, a finite binary string, and possibly returns a single binary string as output. The function \"F\" is called computable if there is a Turing machine that computes it (in the sense that for any finite binary strings \"x\" and \"y,\" \"F(x) = y\" if and only if the Turing machine halts with \"y\" on its tape when given the input \"x\").\nThe function \"F\" is called universal if the following property holds: for every computable function \"f\" of a single variable there is a string \"w\" such that for all \"x\", \"F\"(\"w\"\u00a0\"x\") = \"f\"(\"x\"); here \"w\"\u00a0\"x\" represents the concatenation of the two strings \"w\" and \"x\". This means that \"F\" can be used to simulate any computable function of one variable. Informally, \"w\" represents a \"script\" for the computable function \"f\", and \"F\" represents an \"interpreter\" that parses the script as a prefix of its input and then executes it on the remainder of input.\nThe domain of \"F\" is the set of all inputs \"p\" on which it is defined. For \"F\" that are universal, such a \"p\" can generally be seen both as the concatenation of a program part and a data part, and as a single program for the function \"F\".\nThe function \"F\" is called prefix-free if there are no two elements \"p\", \"p\u2032\" in its domain such that \"p\u2032\" is a proper extension of \"p\". This can be rephrased as: the domain of \"F\" is a prefix-free code (instantaneous code) on the set of finite binary strings. A simple way to enforce prefix-free-ness is to use machines whose means of input is a binary stream from which bits can be read one at a time. There is no end-of-stream marker; the end of input is determined by when the universal machine decides to stop reading more bits. Here, the difference between the two notions of program mentioned in the last paragraph becomes clear; one is easily recognized by some grammar, while the other requires arbitrary computation to recognize.\nThe domain of any universal computable function is a computably enumerable set but never a computable set. The domain is always Turing equivalent to the halting problem.\nDefinition.\nLet \"P\"F be the domain of a prefix-free universal computable function \"F\". The constant \u03a9F is then defined as\nwhere formula_2 denotes the length of a string \"p\". This is an infinite sum which has one summand for every \"p\" in the domain of \"F\". The requirement that the domain be prefix-free, together with Kraft's inequality, ensures that this sum converges to a real number between 0 and 1. If \"F\" is clear from context then \u03a9F may be denoted simply \u03a9, although different prefix-free universal computable functions lead to different values of \u03a9.\nRelationship to the halting problem.\nKnowing the first \"N\" bits of \u03a9, one could calculate the halting problem for all programs of a size up to \"N\". Let the program \"p\" for which the halting problem is to be solved be \"N\" bits long. In dovetailing fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have halted to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first \"N\" bits. If the program \"p\" hasn't halted yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the halting probability would affect the first \"N\" bits. Thus, the halting problem would be solved for \"p\".\nBecause many outstanding problems in number theory, such as Goldbach's conjecture, are equivalent to solving the halting problem for special programs (which would basically search for counter-examples and halt if one is found), knowing enough bits of Chaitin's constant would also imply knowing the answer to these problems. But as the halting problem is not generally solvable, and therefore calculating any but the first few bits of Chaitin's constant is not possible, this just reduces hard problems to impossible ones, much like trying to build an oracle machine for the halting problem would be.\nInterpretation as a probability.\nThe Cantor space is the collection of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. A halting probability can be interpreted as the measure of a certain subset of Cantor space under the usual probability measure on Cantor space. It is from this interpretation that halting probabilities take their name.\nThe probability measure on Cantor space, sometimes called the fair-coin measure, is defined so that for any binary string \"x\" the set of sequences that begin with \"x\" has measure 2\u2212|\"x\"|. This implies that for each natural number \"n\", the set of sequences \"f\" in Cantor space such that \"f\"(\"n\") = 1 has measure 1/2, and the set of sequences whose \"n\"th element is 0 also has measure 1/2.\nLet \"F\" be a prefix-free universal computable function. The domain \"P\" of \"F\" consists of an infinite set of binary strings\nEach of these strings \"p\"\"i\" determines a subset \"S\"\"i\" of Cantor space; the set \"S\"\"i\" contains all sequences in cantor space that begin with \"p\"\"i\". These sets are disjoint because \"P\" is a prefix-free set. The sum\nrepresents the measure of the set \nIn this way, \u03a9\"F\" represents the probability that a randomly selected infinite sequence of 0s and 1s begins with a bit string (of some finite length) that is in the domain of \"F\". It is for this reason that \u03a9\"F\" is called a halting probability.\nProperties.\nEach Chaitin constant \u03a9 has the following properties:\nNot every set that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem is a halting probability. A finer equivalence relation, Solovay equivalence, can be used to characterize the halting probabilities among the left-c.e. reals. One can show that a real number in [0,1] is a Chaitin constant (i.e. the halting probability of some prefix-free universal computable function) if and only if it is left-c.e. and algorithmically random. \u03a9 is among the few definable algorithmically random numbers and is the best-known algorithmically random number, but it is not at all typical of all algorithmically random numbers.\nUncomputability.\nA real number is called computable if there is an algorithm which, given \"n\", returns the first \"n\" digits of the number. This is equivalent to the existence of a program that enumerates the digits of the real number.\nNo halting probability is computable. The proof of this fact relies on an algorithm which, given the first \"n\" digits of \u03a9, solves Turing's halting problem for programs of length up to \"n\". Since the halting problem is undecidable, \u03a9 cannot be computed.\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows. Given the first \"n\" digits of \u03a9 and a \"k\" \u2264 \"n\", the algorithm enumerates the domain of \"F\" until enough elements of the domain have been found so that the probability they represent is within 2\u2212(\"k\"+1) of \u03a9. After this point, no additional program of length \"k\" can be in the domain, because each of these would add 2\u2212\"k\" to the measure, which is impossible. Thus the set of strings of length \"k\" in the domain is exactly the set of such strings already enumerated.\nAlgorithmic randomness.\nA real number is random if the binary sequence representing the real number is an algorithmically random sequence. \nCalude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang showed\nthat a recursively enumerable real number is an algorithmically random sequence if and only if it is a Chaitin's \u03a9 number.\nIncompleteness theorem for halting probabilities.\nFor each specific consistent effectively represented axiomatic system for the natural numbers, such as Peano arithmetic, there exists a constant \"N\" such that no bit of \u03a9 after the \"N\"th can be proven to be 1 or 0 within that system. The constant \"N\" depends on how the formal system is effectively represented, and thus does not directly reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system. This incompleteness result is similar to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem in that it shows that no consistent formal theory for arithmetic can be complete.\nSuper Omega.\nAs mentioned above, the first n bits of Gregory Chaitin's constant \u03a9 are random or incompressible in the sense that we cannot compute them by a halting algorithm with fewer than n-O(1) bits. However, consider the short but never halting algorithm which systematically lists and runs all possible programs; whenever one of them halts its probability gets added to the output (initialized by zero). After finite time the first n bits of the output will never change any more (it does not matter that this time itself is not computable by a halting program). So there is a short non-halting algorithm whose output converges (after finite time) onto the first n bits of \u03a9. In other words, the enumerable first n bits of \u03a9 are highly compressible in the sense that they are limit-computable by a very short algorithm; they are not random with respect to the set of enumerating algorithms. J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber (2000) constructed a limit-computable \"Super \u03a9\" which in a sense is much more random than the original limit-computable \u03a9, as one cannot significantly compress the Super \u03a9 by any enumerating non-halting algorithm.\nFor an alternative \"Super \u03a9\", the universality probability of a prefix-free Universal Turing Machine (UTM) namely, the probability that it remains universal even when every input of it (as a binary string) is prefixed by a random binary string can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the halting problem (i.e., formula_7using Turing Jump notation)."}

They are also known as the recursive numbers, effective numbers (vanDerHoeven) or the computable reals or recursive reals.\nEquivalent definitions can be given using \u03bc-recursive functions, Turing machines, or \u03bb-calculus as the formal representation of algorithms. The computable numbers form a real closed field and can be used in the place of real numbers for many, but not all, mathematical purposes.\nInformal definition using a Turing machine as example.\nIn the following, Marvin Minsky defines the numbers to be computed in a manner similar to those defined by Alan Turing in 1936; i.e., as \"sequences of digits interpreted as decimal fractions\" between 0 and 1:\nThe key notions in the definition are (1) that some \"n\" is specified at the start, (2) for any \"n\" the computation only takes a finite number of steps, after which the machine produces the desired output and terminates.\nAn alternate form of (2) \u2013 the machine successively prints all \"n\" of the digits on its tape, halting after printing the \"n\"th \u2013 emphasizes Minsky's observation: (3) That by use of a Turing machine, a \"finite\" definition \u2013 in the form of the machine's table \u2013 is being used to define what is a potentially-\"infinite\" string of decimal digits.\nThis is however not the modern definition which only requires the result be accurate to within any given accuracy. The informal definition above is subject to a rounding problem called the table-maker's dilemma whereas the modern definition is not.\nFormal definition.\nA real number \"a\" is computable if it can be approximated by some computable function formula_1 in the following manner: given any positive integer \"n\", the function produces an integer \"f\"(\"n\") such that:\nThere are two similar definitions that are equivalent:\nThere is another equivalent definition of computable numbers via computable Dedekind cuts. A computable Dedekind cut is a computable function formula_8 which when provided with a rational number formula_9 as input returns formula_10 or formula_11, satisfying the following conditions:\nAn example is given by a program \"D\" that defines the cube root of 3. Assuming formula_15 this is defined by:\nA real number is computable if and only if there is a computable Dedekind cut \"D\" corresponding to it. The function \"D\" is unique for each computable number (although of course two different programs may provide the same function).\nA complex number is called computable if its real and imaginary parts are computable.\nProperties.\nNot computably enumerable.\nAssigning a G\u00f6del number to each Turing machine definition produces a subset formula_18 of the natural numbers corresponding to the computable numbers and identifies a surjection from formula_18 to the computable numbers. There are only countably many Turing machines, showing that the computable numbers are subcountable. The set formula_18 of these G\u00f6del numbers, however, is not computably enumerable (and consequently, neither are subsets of formula_18 that are defined in terms of it). This is because there is no algorithm to determine which G\u00f6del numbers correspond to Turing machines that produce computable reals. In order to produce a computable real, a Turing machine must compute a total function, but the corresponding decision problem is in Turing degree 0\u2032\u2032. Consequently, there is no surjective computable function from the natural numbers to the computable reals, and Cantor's diagonal argument cannot be used constructively to demonstrate uncountably many of them.\nWhile the set of real numbers is uncountable, the set of computable numbers is classically countable and thus almost all real numbers are not computable. Here, for any given computable number formula_22 the well ordering principle provides that there is a minimal element in formula_18 which corresponds to formula_24, and therefore there exists a subset consisting of the minimal elements, on which the map is a bijection. The inverse of this bijection is an injection into the natural numbers of the computable numbers, proving that they are countable. But, again, this subset is not computable, even though the computable reals are themselves ordered.\nProperties as a field.\nThe arithmetical operations on computable numbers are themselves computable in the sense that whenever real numbers \"a\" and \"b\" are computable then the following real numbers are also computable: \"a + b\", \"a - b\", \"ab\", and \"a/b\" if \"b\" is nonzero.\nThese operations are actually \"uniformly computable\"; for example, there is a Turing machine which on input (\"A\",\"B\",formula_25) produces output \"r\", where \"A\" is the description of a Turing machine approximating \"a\", \"B\" is the description of a Turing machine approximating \"b\", and \"r\" is an formula_25 approximation of \"a\"+\"b\".\nThe fact that computable real numbers form a field was first proved by Henry Gordon Rice in 1954 (Rice 1954).\nComputable reals however do not form a computable field, because the definition of a computable field requires effective equality.\nNon-computability of the ordering.\nThe order relation on the computable numbers is not computable. Let \"A\" be the description of a Turing machine approximating the number formula_6. Then there is no Turing machine which on input \"A\" outputs \"YES\" if formula_28 and \"NO\" if formula_29 To see why, suppose the machine described by \"A\" keeps outputting 0 as formula_25 approximations. It is not clear how long to wait before deciding that the machine will \"never\" output an approximation which forces \"a\" to be positive. Thus the machine will eventually have to guess that the number will equal 0, in order to produce an output; the sequence may later become different from 0. This idea can be used to show that the machine is incorrect on some sequences if it computes a total function. A similar problem occurs when the computable reals are represented as Dedekind cuts. The same holds for the equality relation : the equality test is not computable.\nWhile the full order relation is not computable, the restriction of it to pairs of unequal numbers is computable. That is, there is a program that takes as input two Turing machines \"A\" and \"B\" approximating numbers \"a\" and \"b\", where \"a\" \u2260 \"b\", and outputs whether formula_31 or formula_32 It is sufficient to use \"\u03b5\"-approximations where formula_33 so by taking increasingly small \u03b5 (approaching 0), one eventually can decide whether formula_31 or formula_32\nOther properties.\nThe computable real numbers do not share all the properties of the real numbers used in analysis. For example, the least upper bound of a bounded increasing computable sequence of computable real numbers need not be a computable real number (Bridges and Richman, 1987:58). A sequence with this property is known as a Specker sequence, as the first construction is due to E. Specker (1949). Despite the existence of counterexamples such as these, parts of calculus and real analysis can be developed in the field of computable numbers, leading to the study of computable analysis.\nEvery computable number is definable, but not vice versa. There are many definable, noncomputable real numbers, including:\nBoth of these examples in fact define an infinite set of definable, uncomputable numbers, one for each Universal Turing machine.\nA real number is computable if and only if the set of natural numbers it represents (when written in binary and viewed as a characteristic function) is computable.\nEvery computable number is arithmetical.\nThe set of computable real numbers (as well as every countable, densely ordered subset of computable reals without ends) is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers.\nDigit strings and the Cantor and Baire spaces.\nTuring's original paper defined computable numbers as follows:\nTuring was aware that this definition is equivalent to the formula_25-approximation definition given above. The argument proceeds as follows: if a number is computable in the Turing sense, then it is also computable in the formula_25 sense: if formula_39, then the first \"n\" digits of the decimal expansion for \"a\" provide an formula_25 approximation of \"a\". For the converse, we pick an formula_25 computable real number \"a\" and generate increasingly precise approximations until the \"n\"th digit after the decimal point is certain. This always generates a decimal expansion equal to \"a\" but it may improperly end in an infinite sequence of 9's in which case it must have a finite (and thus computable) proper decimal expansion.\nUnless certain topological properties of the real numbers are relevant it is often more convenient to deal with elements of formula_42 (total 0,1 valued functions) instead of reals numbers in formula_43. The members of formula_42 can be identified with binary decimal expansions but since the decimal expansions formula_45 and formula_46 denote the same real number the interval formula_43 can only be bijectively (and homeomorphically under the subset topology) identified with the subset of formula_42 not ending in all 1's.\nNote that this property of decimal expansions means it's impossible to effectively identify computable real numbers defined in terms of a decimal expansion and those defined in the formula_25 approximation sense. Hirst has shown there is no algorithm which takes as input the description of a Turing machine which produces formula_25 approximations for the computable number \"a\", and produces as output a Turing machine which enumerates the digits of \"a\" in the sense of Turing's definition (see Hirst 2007). Similarly it means that the arithmetic operations on the computable reals are not effective on their decimal representations as when adding decimal numbers, in order to produce one digit it may be necessary to look arbitrarily far to the right to determine if there is a carry to the current location. This lack of uniformity is one reason that the contemporary definition of computable numbers uses formula_25 approximations rather than decimal expansions.\nHowever, from a computational or measure theoretic perspective the two structures formula_42 and formula_43 are essentially identical, and computability theorists often refer to members of formula_42 as reals. While formula_43 formula_42 is totally disconnected, for questions about formula_57 classes or randomness it's much less messy to work in formula_42.\nElements of formula_59 are sometimes called reals as well and though containing a homeomorphic image of formula_60 formula_59 in addition to being totally disconnected isn't even locally compact. This leads to genuine differences in the computational properties. For instance the formula_62 satisfying formula_63 with formula_64 quantifier free must be computable while the unique formula_65 satisfying a universal formula can be arbitrarily high in the hyperarithmetic hierarchy.\nUse in place of the reals.\nThe computable numbers include the specific real numbers which appear in practice, including all real algebraic numbers, as well as \"e\", \"\u03c0\", and many other transcendental numbers. Though the computable reals exhaust those reals we can calculate or approximate, the assumption that all reals are computable leads to substantially different conclusions about the real numbers. The question naturally arises of whether it is possible to dispose of the full set of reals and use computable numbers for all of mathematics. This idea is appealing from a constructivist point of view, and has been pursued by what Bishop and Richman call the \"Russian school\" of constructive mathematics.\nTo actually develop analysis over computable numbers, some care must be taken. For example, if one uses the classical definition of a sequence, the set of computable numbers is not closed under the basic operation of taking the supremum of a bounded sequence (for example, consider a Specker sequence, see the section above). This difficulty is addressed by considering only sequences which have a computable modulus of convergence. The resulting mathematical theory is called computable analysis.\nImplementation.\nThere are some computer packages that work with computable real numbers, representing the real numbers as programs computing approximations. One example is the RealLib package ."}
{"id": "6207", "revid": "14423028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6207", "title": "Electric current", "text": "An electric current is a stream of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space. It is measured as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface or into a control volume. The moving particles are called charge carriers, which may be one of several types of particles, depending on the conductor. In electric circuits the charge carriers are often electrons moving through a wire. In semiconductors they can be electrons or holes. In a electrolyte the charge carriers are ions, while in plasma, an ionized gas, they are ions and electrons.\nThe SI unit of electric current is the ampere, or \"amp\", which is the flow of electric charge across a surface at the rate of one coulomb per second. The ampere (symbol: A) is an SI base unit Electric current is measured using a device called an ammeter.\nElectric currents create magnetic fields, which are used in motors, generators, inductors, and transformers. In ordinary conductors, they cause Joule heating, which creates light in incandescent light bulbs. Time-varying currents emit electromagnetic waves, which are used in telecommunications to broadcast information.\nSymbol.\nThe conventional symbol for current is , which originates from the French phrase \"intensit\u00e9 du courant\", (current intensity). Current intensity is often referred to simply as \"current\". The symbol was used by Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re, after whom the unit of electric current is named, in formulating Amp\u00e8re's force law (1820). The notation travelled from France to Great Britain, where it became standard, although at least one journal did not change from using to until 1896.\nConventions.\nIn a conductive material, the moving charged particles that constitute the electric current are called charge carriers. In metals, which make up the wires and other conductors in most electrical circuits, the positively charged atomic nuclei of the atoms are held in a fixed position, and the negatively charged electrons are the charge carriers, free to move about in the metal. In other materials, notably the semiconductors, the charge carriers can be positive \"or\" negative, depending on the dopant used. Positive and negative charge carriers may even be present at the same time, as happens in an electrolyte in an electrochemical cell.\nA flow of positive charges gives the same electric current, and has the same effect in a circuit, as an equal flow of negative charges in the opposite direction. Since current can be the flow of either positive or negative charges, or both, a convention is needed for the direction of current that is independent of the type of charge carriers. The direction of \"conventional current\" is arbitrarily defined as the direction in which positive charges flow. Negatively charged carriers, such as the electrons (the charge carriers in metal wires and many other electronic circuit components), therefore flow in the opposite direction of conventional current flow in an electrical circuit.\nReference direction.\nA current in a wire or circuit element can flow in either of two directions. When defining a variable formula_1 to represent the current, the direction representing positive current must be specified, usually by an arrow on the circuit schematic diagram. This is called the \"reference direction\" of the current formula_1. When analyzing electrical circuits, the actual direction of current through a specific circuit element is usually unknown until the analysis is completed. Consequently, the reference directions of currents are often assigned arbitrarily. When the circuit is solved, a negative value for the current implies the actual direction of current through that circuit element is opposite that of the chosen reference direction.\nOhm's law.\nOhm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:\nwhere \"I\" is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, \"V\" is the potential difference measured \"across\" the conductor in units of volts, and \"R\" is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms. More specifically, Ohm's law states that the \"R\" in this relation is constant, independent of the current.\nAlternating and direct current.\nIn alternating current (AC) systems, the movement of electric charge periodically reverses direction. AC is the form of electric power most commonly delivered to businesses and residences. The usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave, though certain applications use alternative waveforms, such as triangular or square waves. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. An important goal in these applications is recovery of information encoded (or \"modulated\") onto the AC signal.\nIn contrast, direct current (DC) refers to a system in which the movement of electric charge in only one direction (sometimes called unidirectional flow). Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, thermocouples, solar cells, and commutator-type electric machines of the dynamo type. Alternating current can also be converted to direct current through use of a rectifier. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. An old name for direct current was \"galvanic current\".\nOccurrences.\nNatural observable examples of electrical current include lightning, static electric discharge, and the solar wind, the source of the polar auroras.\nMan-made occurrences of electric current include the flow of conduction electrons in metal wires such as the overhead power lines that deliver electrical energy across long distances and the smaller wires within electrical and electronic equipment. Eddy currents are electric currents that occur in conductors exposed to changing magnetic fields. Similarly, electric currents occur, particularly in the surface, of conductors exposed to electromagnetic waves. When oscillating electric currents flow at the correct voltages within radio antennas, radio waves are generated.\nIn electronics, other forms of electric current include the flow of electrons through resistors or through the vacuum in a vacuum tube, the flow of ions inside a battery or a neuron, and the flow of holes within metals and semiconductors.\nCurrent measurement.\nCurrent can be measured using an ammeter.\nElectric current can be directly measured with a galvanometer, but this method involves breaking the electrical circuit, which is sometimes inconvenient. \nCurrent can also be measured without breaking the circuit by detecting the magnetic field associated with the current. \nDevices, at the circuit level, use various techniques to measure current:\nResistive heating.\nJoule heating, also known as \"ohmic heating\" and \"resistive heating\", is the process of power dissipation by which the passage of an electric current through a conductor increases the internal energy of the conductor, converting thermodynamic work into heat. The phenomenon was first studied by James Prescott Joule in 1841. Joule immersed a length of wire in a fixed mass of water and measured the temperature rise due to a known current through the wire for a 30 minute period. By varying the current and the length of the wire he deduced that the heat produced was proportional to the square of the current multiplied by the electrical resistance of the wire.\nThis relationship is known as Joule's Law. The SI unit of energy was subsequently named the joule and given the symbol \"J\". The commonly known SI unit of power, the watt (symbol: W), is equivalent to one joule per second.\nElectromagnetism.\nElectromagnet.\nIn an electromagnet a coil of wires behaves like a magnet when an electric current flows through it. When the current is switched off, the coil loses its magnetism immediately.\nElectric current produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field can be visualized as a pattern of circular field lines surrounding the wire that persists as long as there is current.\nElectromagnetic induction.\nMagnetic fields can also be used to make electric currents. When a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced, which starts an electric current, when there is a suitable path.\nRadio waves.\nWhen an electric current flows in a suitably shaped conductor at radio frequencies, radio waves can be generated. These travel at the speed of light and can cause electric currents in distant conductors.\nConduction mechanisms in various media.\nIn metallic solids, electric charge flows by means of electrons, from lower to higher electrical potential. In other media, any stream of charged objects (ions, for example) may constitute an electric current. To provide a definition of current independent of the type of charge carriers, \"conventional current\" is defined as moving in the same direction as the positive charge flow. So, in metals where the charge carriers (electrons) are negative, conventional current is in the opposite direction to the overall electron movement. In conductors where the charge carriers are positive, conventional current is in the same direction as the charge carriers.\nIn a vacuum, a beam of ions or electrons may be formed. In other conductive materials, the electric current is due to the flow of both positively and negatively charged particles at the same time. In still others, the current is entirely due to positive charge flow. For example, the electric currents in electrolytes are flows of positively and negatively charged ions. In a common lead-acid electrochemical cell, electric currents are composed of positive hydronium ions flowing in one direction, and negative sulfate ions flowing in the other. Electric currents in sparks or plasma are flows of electrons as well as positive and negative ions. In ice and in certain solid electrolytes, the electric current is entirely composed of flowing ions.\nMetals.\nIn a metal, some of the outer electrons in each atom are not bound to the individual molecules as they are in molecular solids, or in full bands as they are in insulating materials, but are free to move within the metal lattice. These conduction electrons can serve as charge carriers, carrying a current. Metals are particularly conductive because there are many of these free electrons, typically one per atom in the lattice. With no external electric field applied, these electrons move about randomly due to thermal energy but, on average, there is zero net current within the metal. At room temperature, the average speed of these random motions is 106 metres per second. Given a surface through which a metal wire passes, electrons move in both directions across the surface at an equal rate. As George Gamow wrote in his popular science book, \"One, Two, Three...Infinity\" (1947), \"The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.\"\nWhen a metal wire is connected across the two terminals of a DC voltage source such as a battery, the source places an electric field across the conductor. The moment contact is made, the free electrons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor.\nFor a steady flow of charge through a surface, the current \"I\" (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation:\nwhere \"Q\" is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time \"t\". If \"Q\" and \"t\" are measured in coulombs and seconds respectively, \"I\" is in amperes.\nMore generally, electric current can be represented as the rate at which charge flows through a given surface as:\nElectrolytes.\nElectric currents in electrolytes are flows of electrically charged particles (ions). For example, if an electric field is placed across a solution of Na+ and Cl\u2212 (and conditions are right) the sodium ions move towards the negative electrode (cathode), while the chloride ions move towards the positive electrode (anode). Reactions take place at both electrode surfaces, neutralizing each ion.\nWater-ice and certain solid electrolytes called proton conductors contain positive hydrogen ions (\"protons\") that are mobile. In these materials, electric currents are composed of moving protons, as opposed to the moving electrons in metals.\nIn certain electrolyte mixtures, brightly coloured ions are the moving electric charges. The slow progress of the colour makes the current visible.\nGases and plasmas.\nIn air and other ordinary gases below the breakdown field, the dominant source of electrical conduction is via relatively few mobile ions produced by radioactive gases, ultraviolet light, or cosmic rays. Since the electrical conductivity is low, gases are dielectrics or insulators. However, once the applied electric field approaches the breakdown value, free electrons become sufficiently accelerated by the electric field to create additional free electrons by colliding, and ionizing, neutral gas atoms or molecules in a process called avalanche breakdown. The breakdown process forms a plasma that contains enough mobile electrons and positive ions to make it an electrical conductor. In the process, it forms a light emitting conductive path, such as a spark, arc or lightning.\nPlasma is the state of matter where some of the electrons in a gas are stripped or \"ionized\" from their molecules or atoms. A plasma can be formed by high temperature, or by application of a high electric or alternating magnetic field as noted above. Due to their lower mass, the electrons in a plasma accelerate more quickly in response to an electric field than the heavier positive ions, and hence carry the bulk of the current. The free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds (for example, breaking atmospheric oxygen into single oxygen [O2 \u2192 2O], which then recombine creating ozone [O3]).\nVacuum.\nSince a \"perfect vacuum\" contains no charged particles, it normally behaves as a perfect insulator. However, metal electrode surfaces can cause a region of the vacuum to become conductive by injecting free electrons or ions through either field electron emission or thermionic emission. Thermionic emission occurs when the thermal energy exceeds the metal's work function, while field electron emission occurs when the electric field at the surface of the metal is high enough to cause tunneling, which results in the ejection of free electrons from the metal into the vacuum. Externally heated electrodes are often used to generate an electron cloud as in the filament or indirectly heated cathode of vacuum tubes. Cold electrodes can also spontaneously produce electron clouds via thermionic emission when small incandescent regions (called \"cathode spots\" or \"anode spots\") are formed. These are incandescent regions of the electrode surface that are created by a localized high current. These regions may be initiated by field electron emission, but are then sustained by localized thermionic emission once a vacuum arc forms. These small electron-emitting regions can form quite rapidly, even explosively, on a metal surface subjected to a high electrical field. Vacuum tubes and sprytrons are some of the electronic switching and amplifying devices based on vacuum conductivity.\nSuperconductivity.\nSuperconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields occurring in certain materials when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature. It was discovered by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April\u00a08, 1911 in Leiden. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of \"perfect conductivity\" in classical physics.\nSemiconductor.\nIn a semiconductor it is sometimes useful to think of the current as due to the flow of positive \"holes\" (the mobile positive charge carriers that are places where the semiconductor crystal is missing a valence electron). This is the case in a p-type semiconductor. A semiconductor has electrical conductivity intermediate in magnitude between that of a conductor and an insulator. This means a conductivity roughly in the range of 10\u22122 to 104 siemens per centimeter (S\u22c5cm\u22121).\nIn the classic crystalline semiconductors, electrons can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of levels of energy). Energetically, these bands are located between the energy of the ground state, the state in which electrons are tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, the latter describing the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material. The energy bands each correspond to many discrete quantum states of the electrons, and most of the states with low energy (closer to the nucleus) are occupied, up to a particular band called the \"valence band\". Semiconductors and insulators are distinguished from metals because the valence band in any given metal is nearly filled with electrons under usual operating conditions, while very few (semiconductor) or virtually none (insulator) of them are available in the \"conduction band\", the band immediately above the valence band.\nThe ease of exciting electrons in the semiconductor from the valence band to the conduction band depends on the band gap between the bands. The size of this energy band gap serves as an arbitrary dividing line (roughly 4 eV) between semiconductors and insulators.\nWith covalent bonds, an electron moves by hopping to a neighboring bond. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the electron be lifted into the higher anti-bonding state of that bond. For delocalized states, for example in one dimensionthat is in a nanowire, for every energy there is a state with electrons flowing in one direction and another state with the electrons flowing in the other. For a net current to flow, more states for one direction than for the other direction must be occupied. For this to occur, energy is required, as in the semiconductor the next higher states lie above the band gap. Often this is stated as: full bands do not contribute to the electrical conductivity. However, as a semiconductor's temperature rises above absolute zero, there is more energy in the semiconductor to spend on lattice vibration and on exciting electrons into the conduction band. The current-carrying electrons in the conduction band are known as \"free electrons\", though they are often simply called \"electrons\" if that is clear in context.\nCurrent density and Ohm's law.\nCurrent density is the rate at which charge passes through a chosen unit area. It is defined as a vector whose magnitude is the current per unit cross-sectional area. As discussed in Reference direction, the direction is arbitrary. Conventionally, if the moving charges are positive, then the current density has the same sign as the velocity of the charges. For negative charges, the sign of the current density is opposite to the velocity of the charges. In SI units, current density (symbol: j) is expressed in the SI base units of amperes per square metre.\nIn linear materials such as metals, and under low frequencies, the current density across the conductor surface is uniform. In such conditions, Ohm's law states that the current is directly proportional to the potential difference between two ends (across) of that metal (ideal) resistor (or other ohmic device):\nwhere formula_1 is the current, measured in amperes; formula_9 is the potential difference, measured in volts; and formula_10 is the resistance, measured in ohms. For alternating currents, especially at higher frequencies, skin effect causes the current to spread unevenly across the conductor cross-section, with higher density near the surface, thus increasing the apparent resistance.\nDrift speed.\nThe mobile charged particles within a conductor move constantly in random directions, like the particles of a gas. (More accurately, a Fermi gas.) To create a net flow of charge, the particles must also move together with an average drift rate. Electrons are the charge carriers in most metals and they follow an erratic path, bouncing from atom to atom, but generally drifting in the opposite direction of the electric field. The speed they drift at can be calculated from the equation:\nwhere\nTypically, electric charges in solids flow slowly. For example, in a copper wire of cross-section 0.5\u00a0mm2, carrying a current of 5\u00a0A, the drift velocity of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second. To take a different example, in the near-vacuum inside a cathode ray tube, the electrons travel in near-straight lines at about a tenth of the speed of light.\nAny accelerating electric charge, and therefore any changing electric current, gives rise to an electromagnetic wave that propagates at very high speed outside the surface of the conductor. This speed is usually a significant fraction of the speed of light, as can be deduced from Maxwell's equations, and is therefore many times faster than the drift velocity of the electrons. For example, in AC power lines, the waves of electromagnetic energy propagate through the space between the wires, moving from a source to a distant load, even though the electrons in the wires only move back and forth over a tiny distance.\nThe ratio of the speed of the electromagnetic wave to the speed of light in free space is called the velocity factor, and depends on the electromagnetic properties of the conductor and the insulating materials surrounding it, and on their shape and size.\nThe magnitudes (not the natures) of these three velocities can be illustrated by an analogy with the three similar velocities associated with gases. (See also hydraulic analogy.)"}

His father, David Ancillon (1617\u20131692), was obliged to leave France on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and became pastor of the French Protestant community in Berlin.\nAncillon studied law at Marburg, Geneva and Paris, where he was called to the bar. At the request of the Huguenots at Metz, he pleaded its cause at the court of King Louis XIV, urging that it should be excepted in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but his efforts were unsuccessful, and he joined his father in Berlin. He was at once appointed by Elector Frederick III \"\"juge et directeur de colonie de Berlin\".\" Before this, he had published several works on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and its consequences, but his literary capacity was mediocre, his style stiff and cold, and it was his personal character rather than his reputation as a writer that earned him the confidence of the elector.\nIn 1687 Ancillon was appointed head of the so-called \"Academie des nobles,\" the principal educational establishment of the state; later on, as councillor of embassy, he took part in the negotiations which led to the assumption of the title of \"King in Prussia\" by the elector. In 1699 he succeeded Samuel Pufendorf as historiographer to the elector, and the same year replaced his uncle Joseph Ancillon as judge of all the French refugees in the Margraviate of Brandenburg.\nAncillon is mainly remembered for what he did for education in Brandenburg-Prussia, and the share he took, in co-operation with Gottfried Leibniz, in founding the Academy of Berlin.

{"id": "6210", "revid": "1005713017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6210", "title": "Clark Ashton Smith", "text": "Clark Ashton Smith (January 13, 1893 \u2013 August 14, 1961) was an American writer and artist. He achieved early local recognition, largely through the enthusiasm of George Sterling, for traditional verse in the vein of Swinburne. As a poet, Smith is grouped with the West Coast Romantics alongside Joaquin Miller, Sterling, and Nora May French and remembered as \"The Last of the Great Romantics\" and \"The Bard of Auburn\". Smith's work was praised by his contemporaries. H. P. Lovecraft stated that \"in sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of conception, Clark Ashton Smith is perhaps unexcelled\", and Ray Bradbury said that Smith \"filled my mind with incredible worlds, impossibly beautiful cities, and still more fantastic creatures\".\nSmith was one of \"the big three of \"Weird Tales\", with Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft\", but some readers objected to his morbidness and violation of pulp traditions. The fantasy critic L. Sprague de Camp said of him that \"nobody since Poe has so loved a well-rotted corpse.\" Smith was a member of the Lovecraft circle and his literary friendship with Lovecraft lasted from 1922 until Lovecraft's death in 1937. His work is marked by an extraordinarily rich and ornate vocabulary, a cosmic perspective and a vein of sardonic and sometimes ribald humor.\nOf his writing style, Smith stated: \"My own conscious ideal has been to delude the reader into accepting an impossibility, or series of impossibilities, by means of a sort of verbal black magic, in the achievement of which I make use of prose-rhythm, metaphor, simile, tone-color, counter-point, and other stylistic resources, like a sort of incantation.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nSmith was born January 13, 1893, in Long Valley, California, of English and New England parentage. He spent most of his life in the small town of Auburn, California, living in a cabin built by his parents, Fanny and Timeus Smith. Smith professed to hate the town's provincialism but rarely left it until he married late in life. \nHis formal education was limited: he suffered from psychological disorders including intense agoraphobia, and although he was accepted to high school after attending eight years of grammar school, his parents decided it was better for him to be taught at home. An insatiable reader with an extraordinary eidetic memory, Smith appeared to retain most or all of whatever he read. After leaving formal education, he embarked upon a self-directed course of literature, including \"Robinson Crusoe\", \"Gulliver's Travels\", the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and Madame d'Aulnoy, the \"Arabian Nights\" and the poems of Edgar Allan Poe. He read the entire unabridged 13th edition of Webster's Dictionary word for word, studying not only the definitions of the words but also their etymology.\nThe other main course in Smith's self-education was to read the complete 11th edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" at least twice. Smith later taught himself French and Spanish to translate verse out of those languages, including works by G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Paul Verlaine, Amado Nervo, Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer and all but 6 of Charles Baudelaire's 157 poems in \"The Flowers of Evil\".\nEarly writing.\nHis first literary efforts, at the age of 11, took the form of fairy tales and imitations of the Arabian Nights. Later, he wrote long adventure novels dealing with Oriental life. By 14 he had already written a short adventure novel called \"The Black Diamonds\" which was lost for years until published in 2002. Another juvenile novel was written in his teenaged years: \"The Sword of Zagan\" (unpublished until 2004). Like \"The Black Diamonds\", it uses a medieval, \"Arabian Nights\"-like setting, and the \"Arabian Nights\", like the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and the works of Edgar Allan Poe, are known to have strongly influenced Smith's early writing, as did William Beckford's \"Vathek\".\nAt age 17, he sold several tales to \"The Black Cat\", a magazine which specialized in unusual tales. He also published some tales in the \"Overland Monthly\" in this brief foray into fiction which preceded his poetic career.\nHowever, it was primarily poetry that motivated the young Smith and he confined his efforts to poetry for more than a decade. In his later youth, Smith made the acquaintance of the San Francisco poet George Sterling through a member of the local Auburn Monday Night Club, where he read several of his poems with considerable success. On a month-long visit to Sterling in Carmel, California, Smith was introduced by Sterling to the poetry of Baudelaire.\nHe became Sterling's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Sterling helped him to publish his first volume of poems, \"The Star-Treader and Other Poems\", at the age of 19. Smith received international acclaim for the collection. \"The Star-Treader\" was received very favorably by American critics, one of whom named Smith \"the Keats of the Pacific\". Smith briefly moved among the circle that included Ambrose Bierce and Jack London, but his early fame soon faded away.\nHealth breakdown period.\nA little later, Smith's health broke down and for eight years his literary production was intermittent, though he produced his best poetry during this period. A small volume, \"Odes and Sonnets\", was brought out in 1918. Smith came into contact with literary figures who would later form part of H.P. Lovecraft's circle of correspondents; Smith knew them far earlier than Lovecraft. These figures include poet Samuel Loveman and bookman George Kirk. It was Smith who in fact later introduced Donald Wandrei to Lovecraft. For this reason, it has been suggested that Lovecraft might as well be referred to as a member of a \"Smith\" circle as Smith was a member of a Lovecraft one.\nIn 1920 Smith composed a celebrated long poem in blank verse, \"The Hashish Eater, or The Apocalypse of Evil\" which was published in \"Ebony and Crystal\" (1922). This was followed by a fan letter from H. P. Lovecraft, which was the beginning of 15 years of friendship and correspondence. With studied playfulness, Smith and Lovecraft borrowed each other's coinages of place names and the names of strange gods for their stories, though so different is Smith's treatment of the Lovecraft theme that it has been dubbed the \"Clark Ashton Smythos.\"\nIn 1925 Smith published \"Sandalwood\", which was partly funded by a gift of $50 from Donald Wandrei. He wrote little fiction in this period with the exception of some imaginative vignettes or prose poems. Smith was poor for most of his life and often did hard manual jobs such as fruit picking and woodcutting to support himself and his parents. He was an able cook and made many kinds of wine. He also did well digging, typing and journalism, as well as contributing a column to \"The Auburn Journal\" and sometimes worked as its night editor.\nOne of Smith's artistic patrons and frequent correspondents was San Francisco businessman Albert M. Bender.\nProlific fiction-writing period.\nAt the beginning of the Depression in 1929, with his aged parents' health weakening, Smith resumed fiction writing and turned out more than a hundred short stories between 1929 and 1934, nearly all of which can be classed as weird horror or science fiction. Like Lovecraft, he drew upon the nightmares that had plagued him during youthful spells of sickness. Brian Stableford has written that the stories written during this brief phase of hectic productivity \"constitute one of the most remarkable oeuvres in imaginative literature\".\nHe published at his own expense a volume containing six of his best stories, \"The Double Shadow and Other Fantasies\", in an edition of 1000 copies printed by the \"Auburn Journal\". The theme of much of his work is egotism and its supernatural punishment; his weird fiction is generally macabre in subject matter, gloatingly preoccupied with images of death, decay and abnormality.\nMost of Smith's weird fiction falls into four series set variously in Hyperborea, Poseidonis, Averoigne and Zothique. Hyperborea, which is a lost continent of the Miocene period, and Poseidonis, which is a remnant of Atlantis, are much the same, with a magical culture characterized by bizarreness, cruelty, death and postmortem horrors. Averoigne is Smith's version of pre-modern France, comparable to James Branch Cabell's Poictesme. Zothique exists millions of years in the future. It is \"the last continent of earth, when the sun is dim and tarnished\". These tales have been compared to the \"Dying Earth\" sequence of Jack Vance.\nIn 1933 Smith began corresponding with Robert E. Howard, the Texan creator of Conan the Barbarian. From 1933 to 1936, Smith, Howard and Lovecraft were the leaders of the Weird Tales school of fiction and corresponded frequently, although they never met. The writer of oriental fantasies E. Hoffmann Price is the only man known to have met all three in the flesh.\nCritic Steve Behrends has suggested that the frequent theme of 'loss' in Smith's fiction (many of his characters attempt to recapture a long-vanished youth, early love, or picturesque past) may reflect Smith's own feeling that his career had suffered a \"fall from grace\":\nMid-late career: return to poetry and sculpture.\nIn September 1935, Smith's mother Fanny died. Smith spent the next two years nursing his father through his last illness. Timeus died in December 1937. Aged 44, Smith now virtually ceased writing fiction. He had been severely affected by several tragedies occurring in a short period of time: Robert E. Howard's death by suicide (1936), Lovecraft's death from cancer (1937) and the deaths of his parents, which left him exhausted. As a result, he withdrew from the scene, marking the end of \"Weird Tales\"' Golden Age. He began sculpting and resumed the writing of poetry. However, Smith was visited by many writers at his cabin, including Fritz Leiber, Rah Hoffman, Francis T. Laney and others.\nIn 1942, three years after August Derleth founded Arkham House for the purpose of preserving the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Derleth published the first of several major collections of Smith's fiction, \"Out of Space and Time\" (1942). This was followed by \"Lost Worlds\" (1944). The books sold slowly, went out of print and became costly rarities. Derleth published five more volumes of Smith's prose and two of his verse, and at his death in 1971 had a large volume of Smith's poems in press.\nLater life, marriage and death.\nIn 1953, Smith suffered a coronary attack. Aged 61, he married Carol(yn) Jones Dorman on November 10, 1954. Dorman had much experience in Hollywood and radio public relations. After honeymooning at the Smith cabin, they moved to Pacific Grove, California, where he set up a household including her three children. (Carol had been married before). For several years he alternated between the house on Indian Ridge and their house in Pacific Grove. Smith having sold most of his father's tract, in 1957 the old house burned \u2013 the Smiths believed by arson, others said by accident.\nSmith now reluctantly did gardening for other residents at Pacific Grove, and grew a goatee. He spent much time shopping and walking near the seafront but despite Derleth's badgering, resisted the writing of more fiction. In 1961 he suffered a series of strokes and in August 1961 he quietly died in his sleep, aged 68. After Smith's death, Carol remarried (becoming Carolyn Wakefield) and subsequently died of cancer.\nThe poet's ashes were buried beside, or beneath, a boulder to the immediate west of where his childhood home (destroyed by fire in 1957) stood; some were also scattered in a stand of blue oaks near the boulder. There was no marker. Plaques recognizing Smith have been erected at the Auburn Placer County Library in 1985 and in Bicentennial Park in Auburn in 2003.\nBookseller Roy A. Squires was appointed Smith's \"west coast executor\", with Jack L. Chalker as his \"east coast executor\". Squires published many letterpress editions of individual Smith poems.\nSmith's literary estate is represented by his stepson, Prof William Dorman, director of CASiana Literary Enterprises. Arkham House owns the copyright to many Smith stories, though some are now in the public domain.\nFor 'posthumous collaborations' of Smith (stories completed by Lin Carter), see the entry on Lin Carter.\nArtistic periods.\nWhile Smith was always an artist who worked in several very different media, it is possible to identify three distinct periods in which one form of art had precedence over the others.\nPoetry: until 1925.\nSmith published most of his volumes of poetry in this period, including the aforementioned \"The Star-Treader and Other Poems\", as well as \"Odes and Sonnets\" (1918), \"Ebony and Crystal\" (1922) and \"Sandalwood\" (1925). His long poem \"The Hashish-Eater; Or, the Apocalypse of Evil\" was written in 1920.\nWeird fiction: 1926\u20131935.\nSmith wrote most of his weird fiction and Cthulhu Mythos stories, partially inspired by H. P. Lovecraft. Creatures of his invention include Aforgomon, Rlim-Shaikorth, Mordiggian, Tsathoggua, the wizard Eibon, and various others. In an homage to his friend, Lovecraft referred in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" and \"The Battle That Ended the Century\" (written in collaboration with R. H. Barlow) to an Atlantean high-priest, \"Klarkash-Ton\".\nSmith's weird stories form several cycles, called after the lands in which they are set: Averoigne, Hyperborea, Mars, Poseidonis, Zothique. To some extent Smith was influenced in his vision of such lost worlds by the teachings of Theosophy and the writings of Helena Blavatsky. Stories set in Zothique belong to the Dying Earth subgenre. Amongst Smith's science fiction tales are stories set on Mars and the invented planet of Xiccarph.\nHis short stories originally appeared in the magazines \"Weird Tales\", \"Strange Tales\", \"Astounding Stories\", \"Stirring Science Stories\" and \"Wonder Stories\".\nClark Ashton Smith was the third member of the great triumvirate of \"Weird Tales\", with Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard.\nMany of Smith's stories were published in six hardcover volumes by August Derleth under his Arkham House imprint. For a full bibliography to 1978, see Sidney-Fryer, \"Emperor of Dreams\" (cited below). S.T. Joshi is working with other scholars to produce an updated bibliography of Smith's work.\nA selection of Smith's best-known tales includes:\nVisual art: 1935\u20131961.\nBy this time his interest in writing fiction began to lessen and he turned to creating sculptures from soft rock such as soapstone. Smith also made hundreds of fantastic paintings and drawings.\nBibliography.\nThe authoritative bibliography on Smith's work is S.T. Joshi, David E. Schultz and Scott Conners. \"Clark Ashton Smith: A Comprehensive Bibliography.\" NY: Hippocampus Press, 2020. \nOther.\nScholars S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz are preparing various additional volumes of Smith's letters to such of his individual correspondents as Donald Wandrei, Robert H. Barlow, and August Derleth."}

Context-sensitive grammars are more general than context-free grammars, in the sense that there are languages that can be described by CSG but not by context-free grammars. Context-sensitive grammars are less general (in the same sense) than unrestricted grammars. Thus, CSG are positioned between context-free and unrestricted grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.\nA formal language that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar, or, equivalently, by a noncontracting grammar or a linear bounded automaton, is called a context-sensitive language. Some textbooks actually define CSGs as non-contracting, although this is not how Noam Chomsky defined them in 1959. This choice of definition makes no difference in terms of the languages generated (i.e. the two definitions are weakly equivalent), but it does make a difference in terms of what grammars are structurally considered context-sensitive; the latter issue was analyzed by Chomsky in 1963.\nChomsky introduced context-sensitive grammars as a way to describe the syntax of natural language where it is often the case that a word may or may not be appropriate in a certain place depending on the context. Walter Savitch has criticized the terminology \"context-sensitive\" as misleading and proposed \"non-erasing\" as better explaining the distinction between a CSG and an unrestricted grammar.\nAlthough it is well known that certain features of languages (e.g. cross-serial dependency) are not context-free, it is an open question how much of CSG's expressive power is needed to capture the context sensitivity found in natural languages. Subsequent research in this area has focused on the more computationally tractable mildly context-sensitive languages. The syntaxes of some visual programming languages can be described by context-sensitive graph grammars.\nFormal definition.\nA formal grammar \"G\" = (\"N\", \u03a3, \"P\", \"S\"), with \"N\" a set of nonterminal symbols, \u03a3 a set of terminal symbols, \"P\" a set of production rules, and \"S\" the start symbol, is context-sensitive if all rules in \"P\" are of the form\nwith \"A\" \u2208 \"N\", \u03b1,\u03b2 \u2208 (\"N\"\u222a\u03a3)* and \u03b3 \u2208 (\"N\"\u222a\u03a3)+.\nA string \"u\" \u2208 (\"N\"\u222a\u03a3)* directly yields, or directly derives to, a string \"v\" \u2208 (\"N\"\u222a\u03a3)*, denoted as \"u\" \u21d2 \"v\", if \"u\" can be written as \"l\"\u03b1\"A\"\u03b2\"r\", and \"v\" can be written as \"l\"\u03b1\u03b3\u03b2\"r\", for some production rule (\u03b1\"A\"\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u03b3\u03b2) \u2208 \"P\", and some context strings \"l\", \"r\" \u2208 (\"N\"\u222a\u03a3)*.\nMore generally, \"u\" is said to yield, or derive to, \"v\", denoted as \"u\" \u21d2* \"v\", if \"u\" = \"u\"1 \u21d2 ... \u21d2 \"u\"\"n\" = \"v\" for some \"n\"\u22650 and some strings \"u\"2, ..., \"u\"\"n\"-1 (\"N\"\u222a\u03a3)*. That is, the relation (\u21d2*) is the reflexive transitive closure of the relation (\u21d2).\nThe language of the grammar \"G\" is the set of all terminal symbol strings derivable from its start symbol, formally: \"L\"(\"G\") = { \"w\" \u2208 \u03a3*: \"S\" \u21d2* \"w\" }.\nDerivations that do not end in a string composed of terminal symbols only are possible, but don't contribute to \"L\"(\"G\").\nThe only difference between this definition of Chomsky and that of unrestricted grammars is that \u03b3 can be empty in the unrestricted case.\nSome definitions of a context-sensitive grammar only require that for any production rule of the form u \u2192 v, the length of u shall be less than or equal to the length of v. This seemingly weaker requirement is in fact weakly equivalent, see Noncontracting grammar#Transforming into context-sensitive grammar.\nIn addition, a rule of the form\nwhere \u03bb represents the empty string and \"S\" does not appear on the right-hand side of any rule is permitted. The addition of the empty string allows the statement that the context sensitive languages are a proper superset of the context-free languages, rather than having to make the weaker statement that all context-free grammars with no \u2192\u03bb productions are also context sensitive grammars.\nThe name \"context-sensitive\" is explained by the \u03b1 and \u03b2 that form the context of \"A\" and determine whether \"A\" can be replaced with \u03b3 or not. This is different from a context-free grammar where the context of a nonterminal is not taken into consideration. Indeed, every production of a context-free grammar is of the form \"V\" \u2192 \"w\" where \"V\" is a \"single\" nonterminal symbol, and \"w\" is a string of terminals and/or nonterminals; \"w\" can be empty.\nIf the possibility of adding the empty string to a language is added to the strings recognized by the noncontracting grammars (which can never include the empty string) then the languages in these two definitions are identical.\nThe left-context- and right-context-sensitive grammars are defined by restricting the rules to just the form \u03b1\"A\" \u2192 \u03b1\u03b3 and to just \"A\"\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b2, respectively. The languages generated by these grammars are also the full class of context-sensitive languages. The equivalence was established by Penttonen normal form.\nExamples.\nThe following context-sensitive grammar, with start symbol \"S\", generates the canonical non-context-free language { \"a\"\"n\"\"b\"\"n\"\"c\"\"n\" : \"n\" \u2265 1 } :\nRules 1 and 2 allow for blowing-up \"S\" to \"a\"\"n\"\"BC\"(\"BC\")\"n\"-1; rules 3 to 6 allow for successively exchanging each \"CB\" to \"BC\" (four rules are needed for that since a rule \"CB\" \u2192 \"BC\" wouldn't fit into the scheme \u03b1\"A\"\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b2); rules 7\u201310 allow replacing a non-terminals \"B\" and \"C\" with its corresponding terminals \"b\" and \"c\" respectively, provided it is in the right place.\nA generation chain for \"\" is:\nMore complicated grammars formula_1can be used to parse { \"a\"\"n\"\"b\"\"n\"\"c\"\"n\"\"d\"\"n\": \"n\" \u2265 1 }, and other languages with even more letters. Here we show a simpler approach using non-contracting grammars:\nStart with a kernel of regular productions generating the sentential forms\nformula_2 and then include the non contracting productions\nformula_3,\nformula_4,\nformula_5,\nformula_6,\nformula_7,\nformula_8,\nformula_9,\nformula_10,\nformula_11,\nformula_12.\nA non contracting grammar (for which there is an equivalent formula_1) for the language formula_14 is defined by\nformula_15\nand\nformula_16,\nformula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21, formula_22.\nWith these definitions, a derivation for formula_23 is:\nformula_24.\nA noncontracting grammar for the language { \"a\"2i : i \u2265 1 } is constructed in Example 9.5 (p.\u00a0224) of (Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979):\nKuroda normal form.\nEvery context-sensitive grammar which does not generate the empty string can be transformed into a weakly equivalent one in Kuroda normal form. \"Weakly equivalent\" here means that the two grammars generate the same language. The normal form will not in general be context-sensitive, but will be a noncontracting grammar.\nThe Kuroda normal form is an actual normal form for non-contracting grammars.\nProperties and uses.\nEquivalence to linear bounded automaton.\nA formal language can be described by a context-sensitive grammar if and only if it is accepted by some linear bounded automaton (LBA). In some textbooks this result is attributed solely to Landweber and Kuroda. Others call it the Myhill\u2013Landweber\u2013Kuroda theorem. (Myhill introduced the concept of deterministic LBA in 1960. Peter S. Landweber published in 1963 that the language accepted by a deterministic LBA is context sensitive. Kuroda introduced the notion of non-deterministic LBA and the equivalence between LBA and CSGs in 1964.)\n it is still an open question whether every context-sensitive language can be accepted by a \"deterministic\" LBA.\nClosure properties.\nContext-sensitive languages are closed under complement. This 1988 result is known as the Immerman\u2013Szelepcs\u00e9nyi theorem.\nMoreover, they are closed under union, intersection, concatenation, substitution, inverse homomorphism, and Kleene plus.\nEvery recursively enumerable language \"L\" can be written as \"h\"(\"L\") for some context-sensitive language \"L\" and some string homomorphism \"h\".\nComputational problems.\nThe decision problem that asks whether a certain string \"s\" belongs to the language of a given context-sensitive grammar \"G\", is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, there are context-sensitive grammars whose languages are PSPACE-complete. In other words, there is a context-sensitive grammar \"G\" such that deciding whether a certain string \"s\" belongs to the language of \"G\" is PSPACE-complete (so \"G\" is fixed and only \"s\" is part of the input of the problem).\nThe emptiness problem for context-sensitive grammars (given a context-sensitive grammar \"G\", is \"L\"(\"G\")=\u2205 ?) is undecidable.\nAs model of natural languages.\nSavitch has proven the following theoretical result, on which he bases his criticism of CSGs as basis for natural language: for any recursively enumerable set \"R\", there exists a context-sensitive language/grammar \"G\" which can be used as a sort of proxy to test membership in \"R\" in the following way: given a string \"s\", \"s\" is in \"R\" if and only if there exists a positive integer \"n\" for which \"scn\" is in G, where \"c\" is an arbitrary symbol not part of \"R\".\nIt has been shown that nearly all natural languages may in general be characterized by context-sensitive grammars, but the whole class of CSG's seems to be much bigger than natural languages. Worse yet, since the aforementioned decision problem for CSG's is PSPACE-complete, that makes them totally unworkable for practical use, as a polynomial-time algorithm for a PSPACE-complete problem would imply P=NP.\nIt was proven that some natural languages are not context-free, based on identifying so-called cross-serial dependencies and unbounded scrambling phenomena. However this does not necessarily imply that all the class CSG is necessary to capture \"context sensitivity\" in the colloquial sense of these terms in natural languages. For example, the strictly weaker (than CSG) linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) can account for the phenomenon of cross-serial dependencies; one can write a LCFRS grammar for {\"anbncndn\" | \"n\" \u2265 1} for example.\nOngoing research on computational linguistics has focused on formulating other classes of languages that are \"mildly context-sensitive\" whose decision problems are feasible, such as tree-adjoining grammars, combinatory categorial grammars, coupled context-free languages, and linear context-free rewriting systems. The languages generated by these formalisms properly lie between the context-free and context-sensitive languages.\nMore recently, the class PTIME has been identified with range concatenation grammars, which are now considered to be the most expressive of the mild-context sensitive languages."}

Context-sensitive is one of the four types of grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.\nComputational properties.\nComputationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent to a linear bounded nondeterministic Turing machine, also called a linear bounded automaton. That is a non-deterministic Turing machine with a tape of only formula_1 cells, where formula_2 is the size of the input and formula_3 is a constant associated with the machine. This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine.\nThis set of languages is also known as NLINSPACE or NSPACE(\"O\"(\"n\")), because they can be accepted using linear space on a non-deterministic Turing machine. The class LINSPACE (or DSPACE(\"O\"(\"n\"))) is defined the same, except using a deterministic Turing machine. Clearly LINSPACE is a subset of NLINSPACE, but it is not known whether LINSPACE=NLINSPACE.\nExamples.\nOne of the simplest context-sensitive but not context-free languages is formula_4: the language of all strings consisting of occurrences of the symbol \"a\", then \"b\"'s, then \"c\"'s (abc, , , etc.). A superset of this language, called the Bach language, is defined as the set of all strings where \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" (or any other set of three symbols) occurs equally often (, , etc.) and is also context-sensitive.\n can be shown to be a context-sensitive language by constructing a linear bounded automaton which accepts . The language can easily be shown to be neither regular nor context free by applying the respective pumping lemmas for each of the language classes to .\nSimilarly:\nformula_5 is another context-sensitive language; the corresponding context-sensitive grammar can be easily projected starting with two context-free grammars generating sentential forms in the formats\nformula_6\nand\nformula_7\nand then supplementing them with a permutation production like \nformula_8, a new starting symbol and standard syntactic sugar.\nformula_9 is another context-sensitive language (the \"3\" in the name of this language is intended to mean a ternary alphabet); that is, the \"product\" operation defines a context-sensitive language (but the \"sum\" defines only a context-free language as the grammar formula_10 and formula_11 shows). Because of the commutative property of the product, the most intuitive grammar for formula_12 is ambiguous. This problem can be avoided considering a somehow more restrictive definition of the language, e.g. formula_13. This can be specialized to \nformula_14 and, from this, to formula_15, formula_16, etc.\nformula_17 is a context-sensitive language. The corresponding context-sensitive grammar can be obtained as a generalization of the context-sensitive grammars for formula_18, formula_19, etc.\nformula_20 is a context-sensitive language.\nformula_21 is a context-sensitive language (the \"2\" in the name of this language is intended to mean a binary alphabet). This was proved by Hartmanis using pumping lemmas for regular and context-free languages over a binary alphabet and, after that, sketching a linear bounded multitape automaton accepting formula_22.\nformula_23 is a context-sensitive language (the \"1\" in the name of this language is intended to mean an unary alphabet). This was credited by A. Salomaa to Matti Soittola by means of a linear bounded automaton over an unary alphabet (pages 213-214, exercise 6.8) and also to Marti Penttonen by means of a context-sensitive grammar also over an unary alphabet (See: Formal Languages by A. Salomaa, page 14, Example 2.5).\nAn example of recursive language that is not context-sensitive is any recursive language whose decision is an EXPSPACE-hard problem, say, the set of pairs of equivalent regular expressions with exponentiation."}
{"id": "6216", "revid": "37548785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6216", "title": "Chinese room", "text": "The Chinese room argument holds that a digital computer executing a program cannot be shown to have a \"mind\", \"understanding\" or \"consciousness\", regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave. The argument was first presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\" in 1980. It has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of the argument is a thought experiment known as the \"Chinese room\".\nThe argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism, which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols, and that simulation of a given mental state is sufficient for its presence. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls strong AI: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"\nAlthough it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of mainstream AI research, because it does not show a limit in the amount of \"intelligent\" behavior a machine can display. The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.\nChinese room thought experiment.\nSearle's thought experiment begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.\nThe question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine \"literally\" \"understand\" Chinese? Or is it merely \"simulating\" the ability to understand Chinese? Searle calls the first position \"strong AI\" and the latter \"weak AI\".\nSearle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.\nSearle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing a behavior which is then interpreted by the user as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle himself would not be able to understand the conversation. (\"I don't speak a word of Chinese,\" he points out.) Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.\nSearle argues that, without \"understanding\" (or \"intentionality\"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as \"thinking\" and, since it does not think, it does not have a \"mind\" in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that the \"strong AI\" hypothesis is false.\nHistory.\nGottfried Leibniz made a similar argument in 1714 against mechanism (the position that the mind is a machine and nothing more). Leibniz used the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a mill. Leibniz found it difficult to imagine that a \"mind\" capable of \"perception\" could be constructed using only mechanical processes. In the 1961 short story \"The Game\" by Anatoly Dneprov, a stadium of people act as switches and memory cells implementing a program to translate a sentence of Portuguese, a language that none of them knows. In 1974, Lawrence Davis imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 Ned Block envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called the China brain, also the \"Chinese Nation\" or the \"Chinese Gym\".\nThe Chinese Room Argument was introduced in Searle's 1980 paper \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\". It eventually became the journal's \"most influential target article\", generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades, and Searle has continued to defend and refine the argument in many papers, popular articles and books. David Cole writes that \"the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear in the past 25 years\".\nMost of the discussion consists of attempts to refute it. \"The overwhelming majority\", notes \"BBS\" editor Stevan Harnad, \"still think that the Chinese Room Argument is dead wrong\". The sheer volume of the literature that has grown up around it inspired Pat Hayes to comment that the field of cognitive science ought to be redefined as \"the ongoing research program of showing Searle's Chinese Room Argument to be false\".\nSearle's argument has become \"something of a classic in cognitive science\", according to Harnad. Varol Akman agrees, and has described the original paper as \"an exemplar of philosophical clarity and purity\".\nPhilosophy.\nAlthough the Chinese Room argument was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence researchers, philosophers have come to consider it as an important part of the philosophy of mind. It is a challenge to functionalism and the computational theory of mind, and is related to such questions as the mind\u2013body problem, the problem of other minds, the symbol-grounding problem, and the hard problem of consciousness.\nStrong AI.\nSearle identified a philosophical position he calls \"strong AI\":\nThe appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\nThe definition depends on the distinction between \"simulating\" a mind and \"actually having\" a mind. Searle writes that \"according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind.\"\nThe claim is implicit in some of the statements of early AI researchers and analysts. For example, in 1955, AI founder Herbert A. Simon declared that \"there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and create\". Simon, together with Allen Newell and Cliff Shaw, after having completed the first \"AI\" program, the Logic Theorist, claimed that they had \"solved the venerable mind\u2013body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind.\" John Haugeland wrote that \"AI wants only the genuine article: \"machines with minds\", in the full and literal sense. This is not science fiction, but real science, based on a theoretical conception as deep as it is daring: namely, we are, at root, \"computers ourselves\".\"\nSearle also ascribes the following claims to advocates of strong AI:\nStrong AI as computationalism or functionalism.\nIn more recent presentations of the Chinese room argument, Searle has identified \"strong AI\" as \"computer functionalism\" (a term he attributes to Daniel Dennett). Functionalism is a position in modern philosophy of mind that holds that we can define mental phenomena (such as beliefs, desires, and perceptions) by describing their functions in relation to each other and to the outside world. Because a computer program can accurately represent functional relationships as relationships between symbols, a computer can have mental phenomena if it runs the right program, according to functionalism.\nStevan Harnad argues that Searle's depictions of strong AI can be reformulated as \"recognizable tenets of \"computationalism\", a position (unlike \"strong AI\") that is actually held by many thinkers, and hence one worth refuting.\" Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind which argues that the mind can be accurately described as an information-processing system.\nEach of the following, according to Harnad, is a \"tenet\" of computationalism:\nStrong AI vs. biological naturalism.\nSearle holds a philosophical position he calls \"biological naturalism\": that consciousness and understanding require specific biological machinery that are found in brains. He writes \"brains cause minds\" and that \"actual human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical\u2013chemical properties of actual human brains\". Searle argues that this machinery (known to neuroscience as the \"neural correlates of consciousness\") must have some causal powers that permit the human experience of consciousness. Searle's belief in the existence of these powers has been criticized.\nSearle does not disagree with the notion that machines can have consciousness and understanding, because, as he writes, \"we are precisely such machines\". Searle holds that the brain is, in fact, a machine, but that the brain gives rise to consciousness and understanding using machinery that is non-computational. If neuroscience is able to isolate the mechanical process that gives rise to consciousness, then Searle grants that it may be possible to create machines that have consciousness and understanding. However, without the specific machinery required, Searle does not believe that consciousness can occur.\nBiological naturalism implies that one cannot determine if the experience of consciousness is occurring merely by examining how a system functions, because the specific machinery of the brain is essential. Thus, biological naturalism is directly opposed to both behaviorism and functionalism (including \"computer functionalism\" or \"strong AI\"). Biological naturalism is similar to identity theory (the position that mental states are \"identical to\" or \"composed of\" neurological events); however, Searle has specific technical objections to identity theory. Searle's biological naturalism and strong AI are both opposed to Cartesian dualism, the classical idea that the brain and mind are made of different \"substances\". Indeed, Searle accuses strong AI of dualism, writing that \"strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter.\"\nConsciousness.\nSearle's original presentation emphasized \"understanding\"\u2014that is, mental states with what philosophers call \"intentionality\"\u2014and did not directly address other closely related ideas such as \"consciousness\". However, in more recent presentations Searle has included consciousness as the real target of the argument.\nDavid Chalmers writes \"it is fairly clear that consciousness is at the root of the matter\" of the Chinese room.\nColin McGinn argues that the Chinese room provides strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can be shown to be conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.\nSearle argues that this is only true for an observer \"outside\" of the room. The whole point of the thought experiment is to put someone \"inside\" the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.\nApplied ethics.\nPatrick Hew used the Chinese Room argument to deduce requirements from military command and control systems if they are to preserve a commander's moral agency. He drew an analogy between a commander in their command center and the person in the Chinese Room, and analyzed it under a reading of Aristotle\u2019s notions of \"compulsory\" and \"ignorance\". Information could be \"down converted\" from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate 'up conversion' into meaning. Hew cited examples from the USS \"Vincennes\" incident.\nComputer science.\nThe Chinese room argument is primarily an argument in the philosophy of mind, and both major computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers consider it irrelevant to their fields. However, several concepts developed by computer scientists are essential to understanding the argument, including symbol processing, Turing machines, Turing completeness, and the Turing test.\nStrong AI vs. AI research.\nSearle's arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig observe that most AI researchers \"don't care about the strong AI hypothesis\u2014as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence.\" The primary mission of artificial intelligence research is only to create useful systems that \"act\" intelligently, and it does not matter if the intelligence is \"merely\" a simulation.\nSearle does not disagree that AI research can create machines that are capable of highly intelligent behavior. The Chinese room argument leaves open the possibility that a digital machine could be built that \"acts\" more intelligently than a person, but does not have a mind or intentionality in the same way that brains do.\nSearle's \"strong AI\" should not be confused with \"strong AI\" as defined by Ray Kurzweil and other futurists, who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence. Kurzweil is concerned primarily with the \"amount\" of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle's argument sets no limit on this. Searle argues that even a superintelligent machine would not necessarily have a mind and consciousness.\nTuring test.\nThe Chinese room implements a version of the Turing test. Alan Turing introduced the test in 1950 to help answer the question \"can machines think?\" In the standard version, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.\nTuring then considered each possible objection to the proposal \"machines can think\", and found that there are simple, obvious answers if the question is de-mystified in this way. He did not, however, intend for the test to measure for the presence of \"consciousness\" or \"understanding\". He did not believe this was relevant to the issues that he was addressing. He wrote:\nTo Searle, as a philosopher investigating in the nature of mind and consciousness, these are the relevant mysteries. The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the room can behave or function as a conscious mind would.\nSymbol processing.\nThe Chinese room (and all modern computers) manipulate physical objects in order to carry out calculations and do simulations. AI researchers Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon called this kind of machine a physical symbol system. It is also equivalent to the formal systems used in the field of mathematical logic.\nSearle emphasizes the fact that this kind of symbol manipulation is syntactic (borrowing a term from the study of grammar). The computer manipulates the symbols using a form of syntax rules, without any knowledge of the symbol's semantics (that is, their meaning).\nNewell and Simon had conjectured that a physical symbol system (such as a digital computer) had all the necessary machinery for \"general intelligent action\", or, as it is known today, artificial general intelligence. They framed this as a philosophical position, the physical symbol system hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action.\" The Chinese room argument does not refute this, because it is framed in terms of \"intelligent action\", i.e. the external behavior of the machine, rather than the presence or absence of understanding, consciousness and mind.\nChinese room and Turing completeness.\nThe Chinese room has a design analogous to that of a modern computer. It has a Von Neumann architecture, which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a CPU that follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in theoretical computer science as \"Turing complete\", because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a Turing machine can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. Alan Turing writes, \"all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.\" The widely accepted Church\u2013Turing thesis holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.\nThe Turing completeness of the Chinese room implies that it can do whatever any other digital computer can do (albeit much, much more slowly). Thus, if the Chinese room does not or can not contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to Stevan Harnad, are \"no refutation (but rather an affirmation)\" of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that \"no\" digital computers can have a mind.\nThere are some critics, such as Hanoch Ben-Yami, who argue that the Chinese room cannot simulate all the abilities of a digital computer, such as being able to determine the current time.\nComplete argument.\nSearle has produced a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990. The only part of the argument that should be controversial is A3 and it is this point that the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove.\nHe begins with three axioms:\nSearle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:\nThis much of the argument is intended to show that artificial intelligence can never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the computational theory of mind correct? He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:\nSearle claims that we can derive \"immediately\" and \"trivially\" that:\nAnd from this he derives the further conclusions:\nReplies.\nReplies to Searle's argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:\nSome of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.\nSystems and virtual mind replies: finding the mind.\nThese replies attempt to answer the question: since the man in the room doesn't speak Chinese, \"where\" is the \"mind\" that does? These replies address the key ontological issues of mind vs. body and simulation vs. reality. All of the replies that identify the mind in the room are versions of \"the system reply\".\nSystem reply.\nSearle notes that (in this simple version of the reply) the \"system\" is nothing more than a collection of ordinary physical objects; it grants the power of understanding and consciousness to \"the conjunction of that person and bits of paper\" without making any effort to explain how this pile of objects has become a conscious, thinking being. Searle argues that no reasonable person should be satisfied with the reply, unless they are \"under the grip of an ideology;\" In order for this reply to be remotely plausible, one must take it for granted that consciousness can be the product of an information processing \"system\", and does not require anything resembling the actual biology of the brain.\nSearle then responds by simplifying this list of physical objects: he asks what happens if the man memorizes the rules and keeps track of everything in his head? Then the whole system consists of just one object: the man himself. Searle argues that if the man doesn't understand Chinese then the system doesn't understand Chinese either because now \"the system\" and \"the man\" both describe exactly the same object.\nCritics of Searle's response argue that the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head. If we assume a \"mind\" is a form of information processing, then the theory of computation can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for universal programmability (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials \"independently\" from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything \"including\" the specific program). The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's. However, from Searle's perspective, this argument is circular. The question at issue is whether consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires that we make that assumption.\nMore sophisticated versions of the systems reply try to identify more precisely what \"the system\" is and they differ in exactly how they describe it. According to these replies, the \"mind that speaks Chinese\" could be such things as: the \"software\", a \"program\", a \"running program\", a simulation of the \"neural correlates of consciousness\", the \"functional system\", a \"simulated mind\", an \"emergent property\", or \"a virtual mind\" (Marvin Minsky's version of the systems reply, described below).\nVirtual mind reply.\nSearle responds that such a mind is, at best, a simulation, and writes: \"No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched.\" Nicholas Fearn responds that, for some things, simulation is as good as the real thing. \"When we call up the pocket calculator function on a desktop computer, the image of a pocket calculator appears on the screen. We don't complain that 'it isn't \"really\" a calculator', because the physical attributes of the device do not matter.\" The question is, is the human mind like the pocket calculator, essentially composed of information? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, something other than a computer, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? For decades, this question of simulation has lead AI researchers and philosophers to consider whether the term \"synthetic intelligence\" is more appropriate than the common description of such intelligences as \"artificial.\"\nThese replies provide an explanation of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something \"besides\" the man in the room that can understand Chinese, Searle can't argue that (1) the man doesn't understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle's argument fails to prove that \"strong AI\" is false.\nThese replies, by themselves, do not provide any evidence that strong AI exists or can exist, however. They do not show that the system (or the virtual mind) understands Chinese, other than the hypothetical premise that it passes the Turing Test. Searle argues that, if we are to consider Strong AI remotely plausible, the Chinese Room is an example that requires explanation, and it is difficult or impossible to explain how consciousness might \"emerge\" from the room or how the system would have consciousness. As Searle writes \"the systems reply simply begs the question by insisting that the system must understand Chinese\" and thus is dodging the question or hopelessly circular.\nRobot and semantics replies: finding the meaning.\nAs far as the person in the room is concerned, the symbols are just meaningless \"squiggles.\" But if the Chinese room really \"understands\" what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about intentionality, symbol grounding and syntax vs. semantics.\nCommonsense knowledge / contextualist reply.\nTo each of these suggestions, Searle's response is the same: no matter how much knowledge is written into the program and no matter how the program is connected to the world, he is still in the room manipulating symbols according to rules. His actions are syntactic and this can never explain to him what the symbols stand for. Searle writes \"syntax is insufficient for semantics.\"\nHowever, for those who accept that Searle's actions simulate a mind, separate from his own, the important question is not what the symbols mean \"to Searle\", what is important is what they mean \"to the virtual mind.\" While Searle is trapped in the room, the virtual mind is not: it is connected to the outside world through the Chinese speakers it speaks to, through the programmers who gave it world knowledge, and through the cameras and other sensors that roboticists can supply.\nBrain simulation and connectionist replies: redesigning the room.\nThese arguments are all versions of the systems reply that identify a particular \"kind\" of system as being important; they identify some special technology that would create conscious understanding in a machine. (The \"robot\" and \"commonsense knowledge\" replies above also specify a certain kind of system as being important.)\nMany mansions / wait till next year reply.\nThese arguments (and the robot or commonsense knowledge replies) identify some special technology that would help create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test or (even if it did) it would not have conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is easier to see that the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.\nIn the first case, where features like a robot body or a connectionist architecture are required, Searle claims that strong AI (as he understands it) has been abandoned. The Chinese room has all the elements of a Turing complete machine, and thus is capable of simulating any digital computation whatsoever. If Searle's room can't pass the Turing test then there is no other digital technology that could pass the Turing test. If Searle's room \"could\" pass the Turing test, but still does not have a mind, then the Turing test is not sufficient to determine if the room has a \"mind\". Either way, it denies one or the other of the positions Searle thinks of as \"strong AI\", proving his argument.\nThe brain arguments in particular deny strong AI if they assume that there is no simpler way to describe the mind than to create a program that is just as mysterious as the brain was. He writes \"I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works.\" If computation does not provide an \"explanation\" of the human mind, then strong AI has failed, according to Searle.\nOther critics hold that the room as Searle described it does, in fact, have a mind, however they argue that it is difficult to see\u2014Searle's description is correct, but \"misleading.\" By redesigning the room more realistically they hope to make this more obvious. In this case, these arguments are being used as appeals to intuition (see next section).\nIn fact, the room can just as easily be redesigned to \"weaken\" our intuitions. Ned Block's Blockhead argument suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple lookup table of rules of the form \"if the user writes \"S\", reply with \"P\" and goto X\". At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or \"refactored\") into this form, even a brain simulation. In the blockhead scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a memory address\u2014a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one's conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what \"strong AI\" claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (to the point of being physically impossible), and the states could therefore be \"extremely\" specific.\nSearle argues that however the program is written or however the machine is connected to the world, the mind is being \"simulated\" by a simple step-by-step digital machine (or machines). These machines are always just like the man in the room: they understand nothing and don't speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean. Searle writes: \"I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing.\"\nSpeed and complexity: appeals to intuition.\nThe following arguments (and the intuitive interpretations of the arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.\nSeveral critics believe that Searle's argument relies entirely on intuitions. Ned Block writes \"Searle's argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think.\" Daniel Dennett describes the Chinese room argument as a misleading \"intuition pump\" and writes \"Searle's thought experiment depends, illicitly, on your imagining too simple a case, an irrelevant case, and drawing the 'obvious' conclusion from it.\"\nSome of the arguments above also function as appeals to intuition, especially those that are intended to make it seem more plausible that the Chinese room contains a mind, which can include the robot, commonsense knowledge, brain simulation and connectionist replies. Several of the replies above also address the specific issue of complexity. The connectionist reply emphasizes that a working artificial intelligence system would have to be as complex and as interconnected as the human brain. The commonsense knowledge reply emphasizes that any program that passed a Turing test would have to be \"an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge\", as Daniel Dennett explains.\nSpeed and complexity replies.\nAn especially vivid version of the speed and complexity reply is from Paul and Patricia Churchland. They propose this analogous thought experiment:\nChurchland's luminous room.\nStevan Harnad is critical of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes \"Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a phase transition into the mental. It should be clear that is not a counterargument but merely an \"ad hoc\" speculation (as is the view that it is all just a matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of 'complexity.')\"\nSearle argues that his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents' intuitions have no empirical basis. He writes that, in order to consider the \"system reply\" as remotely plausible, a person must be \"under the grip of an ideology\". The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any \"system\" can have consciousness, just by virtue of being a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given our experience of consciousness.\nOther minds and zombies: meaninglessness.\nSeveral replies argue that Searle's argument is irrelevant because his assumptions about the mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality and the nature of the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question. He writes that we must \"presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental.\" These replies question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we cannot use our experience of consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), and the epiphenomena reply argues that Searle's consciousness does not \"exist\" in the sense that Searle thinks it does.\nNils Nilsson writes \"If a program behaves \"as if\" it were multiplying, most of us would say that it is, in fact, multiplying. For all I know, Searle may only be behaving \"as if\" he were thinking deeply about these matters. But, even though I disagree with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I'm willing to credit him with real thought.\"\nAlan Turing anticipated Searle's line of argument (which he called \"The Argument from Consciousness\") in 1950 and makes the other minds reply. He noted that people never consider the problem of other minds when dealing with each other. He writes that \"instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks.\" The Turing test simply extends this \"polite convention\" to machines. He doesn't intend to solve the problem of other minds (for machines or people) and he doesn't think we need to.\nStuart Russell and Peter Norvig argue that, if we accept Searle's description of intentionality, consciousness and the mind, we are forced to accept that consciousness is epiphenomenal: that it \"casts no shadow\", that it is undetectable in the outside world. They argue that Searle must be mistaken about the \"knowability of the mental\", and in his belief that there are \"causal properties\" in our neurons that give rise to the mind. They point out that, by Searle's own description, these causal properties can't be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room couldn't pass the Turing test\u2014the people outside would be able to tell there wasn't a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they can't detect causal properties, they can't detect the existence of the mental. In short, Searle's \"causal properties\" and consciousness itself is undetectable, and anything that cannot be detected either does not exist or does not matter.\nDaniel Dennett provides this extension to the \"epiphenomena\" argument.\nSearle disagrees with this analysis and argues that \"the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don't ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers.\" He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.\nEnglish reply.\nMargaret Boden provided this reply in her paper \"Escaping from the Chinese Room.\" In it she suggests, that even if the person in the room does not understand the Chinese, it does not mean there is no understanding in the room. The person in the room at least understands the rule book used to provide output responses.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Chinese room argument is a central concept in Peter Watts's novels \"Blindsight\" and (to a lesser extent) \"Echopraxia\". It is also a central theme in the video game \"Virtue's Last Reward\", and ties into the game's narrative. In Season 4 of the American crime drama \"Numb3rs\" there is a brief reference to the Chinese room.\nThe Chinese Room is also the name of a British independent video game development studio best known for working on experimental first-person games, such as \"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture\", or \"Dear Esther\".\nIn the 2016 video game The Turing Test, the Chinese Room thought experiment is explained to the player by an AI."}

{"id": "6220", "revid": "9552492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6220", "title": "Circle", "text": "A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\nSpecifically, a circle is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. In everyday use, the term \"circle\" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disc.\nA circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident and the eccentricity is 0, or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using calculus of variations.\nTopological definition.\nIn the field of topology, a circle isn't limited to the geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms. Two topological circles are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy).\nTerminology.\nAll of the specified regions may be considered as \"open\", that is, not containing their boundaries, or as \"closed\", including their respective boundaries.\nHistory.\nThe word \"circle\" derives from the Greek \u03ba\u03af\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2/\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (\"kirkos/kuklos\"), itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (\"krikos\"), meaning \"hoop\" or \"ring\". The origins of the words \"circus\" and \"circuit\" are closely related.\nThe circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. Natural circles would have been observed, such as the Moon, Sun, and a short plant stalk blowing in the wind on sand, which forms a circle shape in the sand. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus.\nEarly science, particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically \"divine\" or \"perfect\" that could be found in circles.\nSome highlights in the history of the circle are:\nAnalytic results.\nCircumference.\nThe ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is (pi), an irrational constant approximately equal to 3.141592654. Thus the circumference \"C\" is related to the radius \"r\" and diameter \"d\" by:\nArea enclosed.\nAs proved by Archimedes, in his Measurement of a Circle, the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, which comes to multiplied by the radius squared:\nEquivalently, denoting diameter by \"d\",\nthat is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length \"d\").\nThe circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality.\nEquations.\nCartesian coordinates.\nIn an \"x\"\u2013\"y\" Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (\"a\", \"b\") and radius \"r\" is the set of all points (\"x\", \"y\") such that\nThis equation, known as the \"equation of the circle\", follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |\"x\" \u2212 \"a\"| and |\"y\" \u2212 \"b\"|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0,\u00a00), then the equation simplifies to\nThe equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as\nwhere \"t\" is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2, interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (\"a\",\u00a0\"b\") to (\"x\",\u00a0\"y\") makes with the positive \"x\"\u00a0axis.\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is\nIn this parameterisation, the ratio of \"t\" to \"r\" can be interpreted geometrically as the stereographic projection of the line passing through the centre parallel to the \"x\"\u00a0axis (see Tangent half-angle substitution). However, this parameterisation works only if \"t\" is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the leftmost point of the circle would be omitted.\nThe equation of the circle determined by three points formula_10 not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the \"3-point form of a circle equation\":\nIn homogeneous coordinates, each conic section with the equation of a circle has the form\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the complex projective plane) the points \"I\"(1: \"i\": 0) and \"J\"(1:\u00a0\u2212\"i\":\u00a00). These points are called the circular points at infinity.\nPolar coordinates.\nIn polar coordinates, the equation of a circle is\nwhere \"a\" is the radius of the circle, formula_14 are the polar coordinates of a generic point on the circle, and formula_15 are the polar coordinates of the centre of the circle (i.e., \"r\"0 is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and \"\u03c6\" is the anticlockwise angle from the positive \"x\"\u00a0axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. , this reduces to simply . When , or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for \"r\", giving\nNote that without the \u00b1 sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\nComplex plane.\nIn the complex plane, a circle with a centre at \"c\" and radius \"r\" has the equation\nIn parametric form, this can be written as\nThe slightly generalised equation\nfor real \"p\", \"q\" and complex \"g\" is sometimes called a generalised circle. This becomes the above equation for a circle with formula_21, since formula_22. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a line.\nTangent lines.\nThe tangent line through a point \"P\" on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through \"P\". If and the circle has centre (\"a\", \"b\") and radius \"r\", then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (\"a\", \"b\") to (\"x\"1, \"y\"1), so it has the form . Evaluating at (\"x\"1, \"y\"1) determines the value of \"c\", and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\nor\nIf , then the slope of this line is\nThis can also be found using implicit differentiation.\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin, then the equation of the tangent line becomes\nand its slope is\nProperties.\nInscribed angles.\nAn inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180\u00b0).\nSagitta.\nThe sagitta (also known as the versine) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\nGiven the length \"y\" of a chord and the length \"x\" of the sagitta, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:\nAnother proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length \"y\" and with sagitta of length \"x\", since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know that it is a part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is () in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (. Solving for \"r\", we find the required result.\nCompass and straightedge constructions.\nThere are many compass-and-straightedge constructions resulting in circles.\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the compass on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\nCircle of Apollonius.\nApollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant \"ratio\" (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, \"A\" and \"B\". (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment \"AB\", a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn \"about\" two points.\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci \"A\" and \"B\" and a ratio of distances, any point \"P\" satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let \"C\" be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment \"AB\". By the angle bisector theorem the line segment \"PC\" will bisect the interior angle \"APB\", since the segments are similar:\nAnalogously, a line segment \"PD\" through some point \"D\" on \"AB\" extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle \"BPQ\" where \"Q\" is on \"AP\" extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle \"CPD\" is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a right angle. The set of points \"P\" such that angle \"CPD\" is a right angle forms a circle, of which \"CD\" is a diameter.\nSecond, see for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\nCross-ratios.\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points \"P\" for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\nStated another way, \"P\" is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio is on the unit circle in the complex plane.\nGeneralised circles.\nIf \"C\" is the midpoint of the segment \"AB\", then the collection of points \"P\" satisfying the Apollonius condition\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\nThus, if \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points \"P\" satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\nInscription in or circumscription about other figures.\nIn every triangle a unique circle, called the incircle, can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle.\nAbout every triangle a unique circle, called the circumcircle, can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three vertices.\nA tangential polygon, such as a tangential quadrilateral, is any convex polygon within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a tangential polygon.\nA cyclic polygon is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric polygon.\nA hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\nLimiting case of other figures.\nThe circle can be viewed as a limiting case of each of various other figures:\nIn other \"p\"-norms.\nDefining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In \"p\"-norm, distance is determined by\nIn Euclidean geometry, \"p\" = 2, giving the familiar\nIn taxicab geometry, \"p\" = 1. Taxicab circles are squares with sides oriented at a 45\u00b0 angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length formula_38 using a Euclidean metric, where \"r\" is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2\"r\". Thus, a circle's circumference is 8\"r\". Thus, the value of a geometric analog to formula_39 is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is formula_40 in Cartesian coordinates and\nin polar coordinates.\nA circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the von Neumann neighborhood of its center.\nA circle of radius \"r\" for the Chebyshev distance (L\u221e metric) on a plane is also a square with side length 2\"r\" parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L1 and L\u221e metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.\nSquaring the circle.\nSquaring the circle is the problem, proposed by ancient geometers, of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem, which proves that pi () is a transcendental number, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. Despite of the impossibility, this topic continues to be of interest for pseudomath enthusiasts.\nSignificance in art and symbolism.\nFrom the time of the earliest known civilisations \u2013 such as the Assyrians and ancient Egyptians, those in the Indus Valley and along the Yellow River in China, and the Western civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome during classical Antiquity \u2013 the circle has been used directly or indirectly in visual art to convey the artist\u2019s message and to express certain ideas.\nHowever, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists\u2019 perceptions. While some emphasised the circle\u2019s perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits.\nThe circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the Dharma wheel, a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth.

They are appointed to the rank of cardinal in addition to their existing position within the Church. Collectively, they constitute the College of Cardinals, and are appointed for life. \nTheir most solemn responsibility is to participate in a conclave to elect a new pope, from among themselves, when the Holy See is vacant. During the period between a pope's death or resignation and the election of his successor, the \"sede vacante\", the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the conclave where the pope is elected is limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs. In addition, cardinals collectively participate in papal consistories, in which matters of importance to the Church are considered and new cardinals may be created. Cardinals of working age are also appointed to roles overseeing dicasteries of the Roman Curia, the central administration of the Catholic Church.\nCardinals are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, being appointed as cardinals \"in addition\" to their existing roles within the Church. Most cardinals are current or retired bishops or archbishops leading dioceses around the world - often the most prominent dioceses in their country. Others are titular bishops who are current or former officials within the Roman Curia (generally the leaders of dicasteries and other bodies linked with the Curia). A very small number are priests recognised by the pope for their service to the Church, who are generally consecrated as bishops before they are made cardinals unless granted a papal dispensation. There is no strict criteria to be qualified for elevation to the College of Cardinals. A cardinal does not necessarily need to be consecrated a priest, and laymen have been cardinals in the past. The selection is entirely up to the pope and with only tradition being his guide. In theory, a cardinal could even be a woman, though this has never happened.\nHistory.\nThere is disagreement about the origin of the term, but consensus that \"cardinalis\" from the word \"cardo\" (meaning \"pivot\" or \"hinge\") was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean \"principal\", \"eminent\", or \"superior\". The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \"title\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become Bishop of Rome. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.\nIn cities other than Rome, the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour. The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III (the Short), ruler of the Franks, in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy. This meaning of the word spread rapidly, and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals. The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V.\nIn 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his titular church or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.\nThe term \"cardinal\" at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church, or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin \"cardo\" (hinge), meaning \"pivotal\" as in \"principal\" or \"chief\". The term was applied in this sense as early as the 9th century to the priests of the \"tituli\" (parishes) of the diocese of Rome.\nIn the year 1563 the Ecumenical Council of Trent, headed by Pope Pius IV, wrote about the importance of selecting good cardinals: \"nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only, and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds; and this the more so, because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office.\"\nThe earlier influence of temporal rulers, notably the French kings, reasserted itself through the influence of cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements. Traditions even developed entitling certain monarchs, including those of Austria, Spain, and France, to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal, a so-called \"crown-cardinal\".\nIn early modern times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. In Henry VIII's England, his chief minister was for some time Cardinal Wolsey. Cardinal Richelieu's power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France. Richelieu's successor was also a cardinal, Jules Mazarin. Guillaume Dubois and Andr\u00e9-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the four great cardinals to have ruled France. In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, Henry, King of Portugal, was crowned king, the only example of a cardinal-king.\nWhile the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals, and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by concordate (usually earning either its primate or the metropolitan of the capital city the cardinal's hat), almost no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate, not even if its bishop is a Patriarch: the notable exception is the Patriarch of Lisbon who, by Pope Clement XII's 1737 bull \"Inter praecipuas apostolici ministerii\", is accorded the right to be elevated to the rank of cardinal in the consistory following their appointment.\nPapal elections.\nIn 1059, Pope Nicholas II gave cardinals the right to elect the Bishop of Rome in the papal bull \"In nomine Domini\". For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but in 1179 the Third Lateran Council restored the right to the whole body of cardinals.\nNumbers.\nIn 1586 Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70: six cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons. Pope John XXIII (1958-1963) exceeded that limit citing the need to staff Church offices. In November 1970 in \"Ingravescentem aetatem\", Pope Paul VI established that electors would be under the age of eighty years. When it took effect on 1 January 1971, it deprived twenty-five cardinals of the right to participate in a conclave. In October 1975 in \"Romano Pontifici eligendo\", he set the maximum number of electors at 120, while establishing no limit on the overall size of the college.\nPopes can set aside church laws and they have regularly brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120, twice reaching as high as 135 with Pope John Paul II's consistories of February 2001 and October 2003. No more than 120 electors have ever participated in a conclave, but most canon lawyers believe that if their number exceeded 120 they would all participate.\nPope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by assigning that rank, in 1965, to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches when named cardinals. In 2018, Pope Francis expanded the cardinal bishops of Roman title, because this had not been done despite recent decades' expansion in the two lower orders of cardinals, besides having all six such cardinals being over the age limit for a conclave.\nTitular churches.\nEach cardinal takes on a titular church, either a church in the city of Rome or one of the suburbicarian sees. The only exception is for patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Nevertheless, cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods, discipline, or the service of their titular churches. They are allowed to celebrate Mass and hear confessions and lead visits and pilgrimages to their titular churches, in coordination with the staff of the church. They often support their churches monetarily, and many cardinals do keep in contact with the pastoral staffs of their titular churches. The term cardinal is from the Latin word \"cardo\" meaning a hinge. Here it means a \"door\", an example of synecdoche, a figure of speech whereby the part refers to the whole. The \"door\" is the address of the titular church from which the cardinal derives his membership of the Roman clergy, who elect the Pope.\nThe Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to such a titular church also receives the titular bishopric of Ostia, the primary suburbicarian see. Cardinals governing a particular church retain that church.\nTitle and reference style.\nIn 1630, Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be \"Eminence\" (previously, it had been \"illustrissimo\" and \"reverendissimo\") and decreed that their secular rank would equate to Prince, making them secondary only to the Pope and crowned monarchs.\nIn accordance with tradition, they sign by placing the title \"Cardinal\" (abbreviated \"Card.\") after their personal name and before their surname as, for instance, \"John Card(inal) Doe\" or, in Latin, \"Ioannes Card(inalis) Doe\". Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan, hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English. However, official sources, such as the Catholic News Service, say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as \"Cardinal [First name] [Surname]\". This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the church. This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences. Oriental patriarchs who are created cardinals customarily use \"Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis\" as their full title, probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy.\nThe [First name] Cardinal [Surname] order is used in the Latin proclamation of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon, if the new pope is a cardinal, as it has been since 1378.\nOrders and their chief offices.\nCardinal bishops.\nCardinal bishops (cardinals of the episcopal order) are the senior order of cardinals. Though in modern times the vast majority of cardinals are also bishops or archbishops, few are \"cardinal bishops\". For most of the second millennium there were six cardinal bishops, each presiding over one of the seven suburbicarian sees around Rome: Ostia, Albano, Porto and Santa Rufina, Palestrina, Sabina and Mentana, Frascati, and Velletri. Velletri was united with Ostia from 1150 until 1914, when Pope Pius X separated them again, but decreed that whichever cardinal bishop became Dean of the College of Cardinals would keep the suburbicarian see he already held, adding to it that of Ostia, with the result that there continued to be only six cardinal bishops. Since 1962, the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees, each of which is governed by a separate ordinary.\nUntil 1961, membership in the order of cardinal bishops was achieved through precedence in the College of Cardinals. When a suburbicarian see fell vacant, the most senior cardinal by precedence could exercise his option to claim the see and be promoted to the order of cardinal bishops. Pope John XXIII abolished that privilege on 10 March 1961 and made the right to promote someone to the order of cardinal bishops the sole prerogative of the pope.\nIn 1965, Pope Paul VI decreed in his \"motu proprio\" \"Ad purpuratorum Patrum Collegium\" that patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches who were named cardinals (i.e. \"cardinal patriarchs\") would also be cardinal bishops, ranking after the six Roman rite cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian sees. (Latin Church patriarchs who become cardinals are cardinal priests, not cardinal bishops: for example Angelo Scola was made Patriarch of Venice in 2002 and cardinal priest of Santi XII Apostoli in 2003.) Those of cardinal patriarch rank continue to hold their patriarchal see and are not assigned any Roman title (suburbicarian see or title or deaconry).\nAt the June 2018 consistory, Pope Francis increased the number of Latin Church cardinal bishops to match the expansion in cardinal priests and cardinal deacons in recent decades. He elevated four cardinals to this rank granting their titular churches and deaconries suburbicarian rank \"pro hac vice\" (temporarily) and making them equivalent to suburbicarian see titles. At the time of the announcement, all six cardinal bishops of suburbicarian see titles, as well as two of the three cardinal patriarchs, were non-electors because of having reached age 80. Pope Francis created another cardinal bishop in the same way on 1 May 2020, bringing the number of Latin Church cardinal bishops to eleven.\nThe Dean of the College of Cardinals, the highest ranking cardinal, was formerly the longest serving cardinal bishop, but since 1965 is elected by the Latin Church cardinal bishops from among their number, subject to papal approval. Likewise the Vice-Dean, formerly the second longest serving, is also elected. Seniority of the remaining Latin Church cardinal bishops is still by date of appointment to the rank. For a period ending in the mid-20th century, long-serving cardinal priests were entitled to fill vacancies that arose among the cardinal bishops, just as cardinal deacons of ten years' standing are still entitled to become cardinal priests.\nCardinal priests.\nCardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church, ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops. Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally also bishops of important dioceses throughout the world, though some hold Curial positions.\nIn modern times, the name \"cardinal priest\" is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests. Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the \"cardinal\" priests, the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as Bishop of Rome (the Latin \"cardo\" means \"hinge\"). Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel\u2014the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of Rome, the pope.\nWhile the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and Roman Curia, every cardinal priest has a titular church in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops were given one of the suburbicarian dioceses around Rome. Pope Paul VI abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal's name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to celebrate Mass and preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.\nWhile the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.\nThe cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled \"cardinal protopriest\". He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80, at which cardinals are barred from the conclave. The current cardinal protopriest is Michael Michai Kitbunchu of Thailand.\nCardinal deacons.\nThe cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals. Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday. Bishops with diocesan responsibilities, however, are created cardinal priests.\nCardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the Papal Household and the seven deacons who supervised the Church's works in the districts of Rome during the early Middle Ages, when church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services. Cardinal deacons are given title to one of these deaconries.\nCardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the Roman Curia holding various posts in the church administration. Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important. They are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied. Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V, which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals, there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent. John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II maintained this ratio.\nAs of 2005, there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries, though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons. Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to \"opt for the order of cardinal priests\" (\"optazione\") after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years. They may on such elevation take a vacant \"title\" (a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest's \"title\" for that occasion. When elevated to cardinal priests, they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons (thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them, regardless of order).\nWhen not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual \"Urbi et Orbi\" papal blessing, some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the dalmatics they would don with the simple white mitre (so called \"mitra simplex\").\nCardinal protodeacon.\nThe cardinal protodeacon is the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals. If he is a cardinal elector and participates in a conclave, he announces a new pope's election and name from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The proto-deacon also bestows the pallium on the new pope and crowns him with the papal tiara, although the crowning has not been celebrated since Pope John Paul I opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony in 1978. The current cardinal protodeacon is Renato Raffaele Martino.\nCardinal protodeacons since 1911.\n\u2020Was protodeacon at time of death\nSpecial types of cardinals.\nCamerlengo.\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, assisted by the Vice-Camerlengo and the other prelates of the office known as the Apostolic Camera, has functions that in essence are limited to a period of \"sede vacante\" of the papacy. He is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the Holy See and present the results to the College of Cardinals, as they gather for the papal conclave.\nCardinals who are not bishops.\nUntil 1917, it was possible for someone who was not a priest, but only in minor orders, to become a cardinal (see \"lay cardinals\", below), but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons. For example, in the 16th century, Reginald Pole was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. In 1917 it was established that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests, and, in 1962, Pope John XXIII set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as bishops, even if they are only priests at the time of appointment. As a consequence of these two changes, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of priesthood at his appointment, and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration. Several cardinals aged over 80 or close to it when appointed have obtained dispensation from the rule of having to be a bishop. These were all appointed cardinal-deacons, but Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest.\nA cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other pontificalia (episcopal regalia: mitre, crozier, zucchetto, pectoral cross and ring). Even if not a bishop, any cardinal has both actual and honorary precedence over non-cardinal patriarchs, as well as the archbishops and bishops who are not cardinals, but he cannot perform the functions reserved solely to bishops, such as ordination. The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it, and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent papal conclaves.\n\"Lay cardinals\".\nAt various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \"lay cardinals\". Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\nCardinals \"in pectore\" or secret cardinals.\nIn addition to the named cardinals, the pope may name secret cardinals or cardinals \"in pectore\" (Latin for \"in the breast\"). During the Western Schism, many cardinals were created by the contending popes. Beginning with the reign of Pope Martin V, cardinals were created without publishing their names until later, a practice termed \"creati et reservati in pectore\". A cardinal named \"in pectore\" is known only to the pope. In the modern era popes have named cardinals \"in pectore\" to protect them or their congregations from political reprisals. If conditions change, the pope makes the appointment public. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those made cardinals at the time of his \"in pectore\" appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an \"in pectore\" cardinal, the person's status as cardinal expires. The last pope known to have named a cardinal \"in pectore\" is Pope John Paul II, who named four, including one whose identity was never revealed.\nVesture and privileges.\nWhen in choir dress, a Latin Church cardinal wears scarlet garments\u2014the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal's willingness to die for his faith. Excluding the rochet\u2014which is always white\u2014the scarlet garments include the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta (over the usual scarlet zucchetto). The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color, but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates. Until the 1460s, it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business. His normal-wear cassock is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia (sash). Occasionally, a cardinal wears a scarlet \"ferraiolo\" which is a cape worn over the shoulders, tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front, without any 'trim' or piping on it. It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such.\nEastern Catholic cardinals continue to wear the normal dress appropriate to their liturgical tradition, though some may line their cassocks with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias, or in some cases, wear Eastern-style cassocks entirely of scarlet.\nIn previous times, at the consistory at which the pope named a new cardinal, he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a galero. This custom was discontinued in 1969 and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta. In ecclesiastical heraldry, however, the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal's coat of arms. Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral, and when a cardinal died, it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb. Some cardinals will still have a galero made, even though it is not officially part of their apparel.\nTo symbolize their bond with the papacy, the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring, which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting a cardinal (as with a bishop's episcopal ring). Before the new uniformity imposed by John Paul II, each cardinal was given a ring, the central piece of which was a gem, usually a sapphire, with the pope's stemma engraved on the inside. There is now no gemstone, and the pope chooses the image on the outside: under Pope Benedict XVI it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, with Mary and John to each side. The ring includes the pope's coat of arms on the inside.\nCardinals have in canon law a \"privilege of forum\" (i.e., exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank): only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction (cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual, or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin, where culpability must be determined and the appropriate\necclesiastical penalty imposed). The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to a tribunal, usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia. Without such delegation, no ecclesiastical court, even the Roman Rota, is competent to judge a canon law case against a cardinal.\nAdditionally, canon law gives cardinals the faculty of hearing confessions validly and licitly everywhere, whereas other priests and bishops must be granted this faculty and might be restricted in its use by the local bishop."}

{"id": "6225", "revid": "18113352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6225", "title": "Cantigas de Santa Maria", "text": "The Cantigas de Santa Maria (, ; \"Canticles of Holy Mary\") are 420 poems with musical notation, written in the medieval Galician-Portuguese language during the reign of Alfonso X of Castile \"El Sabio\" (1221\u20131284) and often attributed to him.\nIt is one of the largest collections of monophonic (solo) songs from the Middle Ages and is characterized by the mention of the Virgin Mary in every song, while every tenth song is a hymn.\nThe \"Cantigas\" have survived in four manuscript codices: two at El Escorial, one at Madrid's National Library, and one in Florence, Italy. The E codex from El Escorial is illuminated with colored miniatures showing pairs of musicians playing a wide variety of instruments. The \"C\u00f3dice Rico\" (T) from El Escorial and the one in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Florence (F) are richly illuminated with narrative vignettes.\nDescription.\nThe Cantigas are written in the early Medieval Galician variety of Galician-Portuguese, using Galician spelling; this was because of Galician-Portuguese being fashionable as a lyrical language in Castile at the time, as well as Alfonso X having passed part of his early years in Galicia and so probably being a fluent speaker since his childhood.\nThe Cantigas are a collection of 420 poems, 356 of which are in a narrative format relating to Marian miracles; the rest of them, except an introduction and two prologues, are of songs of praise or involve Marian festivities. The Cantigas depict the Virgin Mary in a very humanized way, often having her play a role in earthly episodes.\nThe authors are unknown, although several studies have suggested that Galician poet Airas Nunes might have been the author of a large number of the Cantiga poems. King Alfonso X \u2014 named as Affonso in the Cantigas \u2014 is also believed to be an author of some of them as he refers himself in first person. Support for this theory can be found in the prologue of the Cantigas. Also, many sources credit Alfonso owing to his influence on other works within the poetic tradition, including his introduction on religious song. Although King Alfonso X's authorship is debatable, his influence is not. While the other major works that came out of Alfonso's workshops, including histories and other prose texts, were in Castilian, the Cantigas are in Galician-Portuguese, and reflect the popularity in the Castilian court of other poetic corpuses such as the cantigas d'amigo and cantigas d'amor.\nThe metrics are extraordinarily diverse: 280 different formats for the 420 Cantigas. The most common are the \"virelai\" and the \"rondeau\". The length of the lines varies between two and 24 syllables. The narrative voice in many of the songs describes an erotic relationship, in the troubadour fashion, with the Divine.\nThe music is written in notation which is similar to that used for chant, but also contains some information about the length of the notes. Several transcriptions exist. The Cantigas are frequently recorded and performed by Early Music groups, and quite a few CDs featuring music from the Cantigas are available.\nCodices.\nThe Cantigas are preserved in four manuscripts: \"To\" (\"c\u00f3dice de Toledo,\" Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a, MS 10069), \"T\" (Biblioteca de El Escorial, MS T.I.1), \"F\" (\"c\u00f3dice de Florencia,\" Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale, MS b.r. 20) and \"E\" (\"c\u00f3dice de los m\u00fasicos,\" Biblioteca de El Escorial MS B.I.2). \"E\" contains the largest number of songs (406 Cantigas, plus the Introduction and the Prologue); it contains 41 carefully detailed miniatures and many illuminated letters. \"To\" is the earliest collection and contains 129 songs. Although not illustrated, it is richly decorated with pen flourished initials, and great care has been taken over its construction. The \"T\" and \"F\" manuscripts are sister volumes. \"T\" contains 195 surviving cantigas (8 are missing due to loss of folios) which roughly correspond in order to the first two hundred in \"E\", each song being illustrated with either 6 or 12 miniatures that depict scenes from the cantiga. \"F\" follows the same format but has only 111 cantigas, of which 7 have no text, only miniatures. These are basically a subset of those found in the second half of \"E\", but are presented here in a radically different order. \"F\" was never finished, and so no music was ever added. Only the empty staves display the intention to add musical notation to the codex at a later date. It is generally thought that the codices were constructed during Alfonso's lifetime, \"To\" perhaps in the 1270s, and \"T\"/\"F\" and \"E\" in the early 1280s up until the time of his death in 1284.\nThe music.\nThe musical forms within the Cantigas, and there are many, are still being studied. There have been many false leads, and there is little beyond pitch value that is very reliable. Mensuration is a particular problem in the Cantigas, and most attempts at determining meaningful rhythmic schemes have tended, with some exceptions, to be unsatisfactory. This remains a lively topic of debate and study. Progress, while on-going, has nevertheless been significant over the course of the last 20 years."}
{"id": "6226", "revid": "34452882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6226", "title": "Claudio Monteverdi", "text": "Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (, ; ; baptized 15 May 1567 \u2013 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, string player, choirmaster, and priest. A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and Baroque periods of music history.\nBorn in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua () and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was \"maestro di cappella\" at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics.\nMuch of Monteverdi's output, including many stage works, has been lost. His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals, large-scale religious works, such as his \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\" (\"Vespers for the Blessed Virgin\") of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera \"L'Orfeo\" (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for Venice, including \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\" and \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\".\nWhile he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony, as evidenced in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a \"seconda pratica\", contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the \"prima pratica\". Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.\nLife.\nBackground: Italy in the time of Monteverdi.\nMonteverdi is usually described as an \"Italian\" composer, even though in his lifetime the concept of \"Italy\" existed only as a geographical entity. Although the inhabitants of the peninsula shared much in common in terms of history, culture and language, in political terms the people experienced various layers of authority and jurisdiction. In the first instance they were subject to the local rulers of their city-states, powerful families such as the Gonzagas (rulers of the Duchy of Mantua). And in the case of Cremona, part of the Duchy of Milan, it fell under the control of the Spanish Empire, in 1559.\nCremona 1567\u20131591.\nMonteverdi was baptised in the church of SS Nazaro e Celso, Cremona, on 15 May 1567. The register records his name as \"Claudio Zuan Antonio\" the son of \"Messer Baldasar Mondeverdo\". He was the first child of the apothecary Baldassare Monteverdi and his first wife Maddalena (n\u00e9e Zignani); they had married early the previous year. Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare Monteverdi (b. 1573) was also to become a musician; there were two other brothers and two sisters from Baldassare's marriage to Maddalena and his subsequent marriage in 1576 or 1577. Cremona was close to the border of the Republic of Venice, and not far from the lands controlled by the Duchy of Mantua, in both of which states Monteverdi was later to establish his career.\nThere is no clear record of Monteverdi's early musical training, or evidence that (as is sometimes claimed) he was a member of the Cathedral choir or studied at Cremona University. Monteverdi's first published work, a set of motets, \" (Sacred Songs)\" for three voices, was issued in Venice in 1582, when he was only fifteen years old. In this, and his other initial publications, he describes himself as the pupil of Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, who was from 1581 (and possibly from 1576) to 1592 the \"maestro di cappella\" at Cremona Cathedral. The musicologist Tim Carter deduces that Ingegneri \"gave him a solid grounding in counterpoint and composition\", and that Monteverdi would also have studied playing instruments of the viol family and singing.\nMonteverdi's first publications also give evidence of his connections beyond Cremona, even in his early years. His second published work, \"Madrigali spirituali\" (Spiritual Madrigals, 1583), was printed at Brescia. His next works (his first published secular compositions) were sets of five-part madrigals, according to his biographer Paolo Fabbri: \"the inevitable proving ground for any composer of the second half of the sixteenth century\u00a0... the secular genre \"par excellence\"\". The first book of madrigals (Venice, 1587) was dedicated to Count Marco Verit\u00e0 of Verona; the second book of madrigals (Venice, 1590) was dedicated to the President of the Senate of Milan, Giacomo Ricardi, for whom he had played the viola da braccio in 1587.\nMantua 1591\u20131613.\nCourt musician.\nIn the dedication of his second book of madrigals, Monteverdi had described himself as a player of the \"vivuola\" (which could mean either viola da gamba or viola da braccio). In 1590 or 1591 he entered the service of Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga of Mantua; he recalled in his dedication to the Duke of his third book of madrigals (Venice, 1592) that \"the most noble exercise of the \"vivuola\" opened to me the fortunate way into your service.\" In the same dedication he compares his instrumental playing to \"flowers\" and his compositions as \"fruit\" which as it matures \"can more worthily and more perfectly serve you\", indicating his intentions to establish himself as a composer.\nDuke Vincenzo was keen to establish his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, the \"maestro di capella\" at the court was the Flemish musician Giaches de Wert. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist Salomone Rossi, Rossi's sister, the singer Madama Europa, and Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in 1603. Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.\nWhen Wert died in 1596, his post was given to Benedetto Pallavicino, but Monteverdi was clearly highly regarded by Vincenzo and accompanied him on his military campaigns in Hungary (1595) and also on a visit to Flanders in 1599. Here at the town of Spa he is reported by his brother Giulio Cesare as encountering, and bringing back to Italy, the \"canto alla francese\". (The meaning of this, literally \"song in the French style\", is debatable, but may refer to the French-influenced poetry of Gabriello Chiabrera, some of which was set by Monteverdi in his \"Scherzi musicali\", and which departs from the traditional Italian style of lines of 9 or 11 syllables). Monteverdi may possibly have been a member of Vincenzo's entourage at Florence in 1600 for the marriage of Maria de' Medici and Henry IV of France, at which celebrations Jacopo Peri's opera \"Euridice\" (the earliest surviving opera) was premiered. On the death of Pallavicino in 1601, Monteverdi was confirmed as the new \"maestro di capella\".\nArtusi controversy and \"seconda pratica\".\nAt the turn of the 17th century, Monteverdi found himself the target of musical controversy. The influential Bolognese theorist Giovanni Maria Artusi attacked Monteverdi's music (without naming the composer) in his work \"L'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Artusi, or On the imperfections of modern music)\" of 1600, followed by a sequel in 1603. Artusi cited extracts from Monteverdi's works not yet published (they later formed parts of his fourth and fifth books of madrigals of 1603 and 1605), condemning their use of harmony and their innovations in use of musical modes, compared to orthodox polyphonic practice of the sixteenth century. Artusi attempted to correspond with Monteverdi on these issues; the composer refused to respond, but found a champion in a pseudonymous supporter, \"L'Ottuso Academico\" (\"The Obtuse Academic\"). Eventually Monteverdi replied in the preface to the fifth book of madrigals that his duties at court prevented him from a detailed reply; but in a note to \"the studious reader\", he claimed that he would shortly publish a response, \"Seconda Pratica, overo Perfettione della Moderna Musica (The Second Style, or Perfection of Modern Music).\" This work never appeared, but a later publication by Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare made it clear that the \"seconda pratica\" which Monteverdi defended was not seen by him as a radical change or his own invention, but was an evolution from previous styles (\"prima pratica\") which was complementary to them.\nThis debate seems in any case to have raised the composer's profile, leading to reprints of his earlier books of madrigals. Some of his madrigals were published in Copenhagen in 1605 and 1606, and the poet Tommaso Stigliani (1573-1651) published a eulogy of him in his 1605 poem \"O sirene de' fiumi\". The composer of madrigal comedies and theorist Adriano Banchieri wrote in 1609: \"I must not neglect to mention the most noble of composers, Monteverdi\u00a0... his expressive qualities are truly deserving of the highest commendation, and we find in them countless examples of matchless declamation\u00a0... enhanced by comparable harmonies.\" The modern music historian Massimo Ossi has placed the Artusi issue in the context of Monteverdi's artistic development: \"If the controversy seems to define Monteverdi's historical position, it also seems to have been about stylistic developments that by 1600 Monteverdi had already outgrown\".\nThe non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised explanatory treatise may have been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the \"seconda pratica\" was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the \"seconda practica\", in a treatise entitled \"Melodia\"; he may still have been working on this at the time of his death ten years later.\nOpera, conflict and departure.\nIn 1606 Vincenzo's heir Francesco commissioned from Monteverdi the opera \"L'Orfeo\", to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio, for the Carnival season of 1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; the singers included, in the title role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of \"Euridice\" witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the opera \"L'Arianna\" (libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini), intended for the celebration of the marriage of Francesco to Margherita of Savoy. All the music for this opera is lost apart from \"Ariadne's Lament\", which became extremely popular. To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment \"Il ballo delle ingrate\".\nThe strain of the hard work Monteverdi had been putting into these and other compositions was exacerbated by personal tragedies. His wife died in September 1607 and the young singer Caterina Martinelli, intended for the title role of \"Arianna\", died of smallpox in March 1608. Monteverdi also resented his increasingly poor financial treatment by the Gonzagas. He retired to Cremona in 1608 to convalesce, and wrote a bitter letter to Vincenzo's minister Annibale Chieppio in November of that year seeking (unsuccessfully) \"an honourable dismissal\". Although the Duke increased Monteverdi's salary and pension, and Monteverdi returned to continue his work at the court, he began to seek patronage elsewhere. After publishing his Vespers in 1610, which were dedicated to Pope Paul V, he visited Rome, ostensibly hoping to place his son Francesco at a seminary, but apparently also seeking alternative employment. In the same year he may also have visited Venice, where a large collection of his church music was being printed, with a similar intention.\nDuke Vincenzo died on 18 February 1612. When Francesco succeeded him, court intrigues and cost-cutting led to the dismissal of Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare, who both returned, almost penniless, to Cremona. Despite Francesco's own death from smallpox in December 1612, Monteverdi was unable to return to favour with his successor, his brother Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga. In 1613, following the death of Giulio Cesare Martinengo, Monteverdi auditioned for his post as \"maestro\" at the basilica of San Marco in Venice, for which he submitted music for a Mass. He was appointed in August 1613, and given 50 ducats for his expenses (of which he was robbed, together with his other belongings, by highwaymen at Sanguinetto on his return to Cremona).\nVenice 1613\u20131643.\nMaturity: 1613\u20131630.\nMartinengo had been ill for some time before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been neglected and the administration overlooked. When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the \"capella\"), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events. Among the recruits to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who joined in 1616 at the age of 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with Monteverdi. Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional \"a cappella\" repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of continuo and other instruments. Apart from this he was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new mass each year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas Eve, cantatas in honour of the Venetian Doge, and numerous other works (many of which are lost). Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The Procurators of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed their satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 ducats to 400.\nThe relative freedom which the Republic of Venice afforded him, compared to the problems of court politics in Mantua, are reflected in Monteverdi's letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13 March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which Mantua still owes him. Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state. These included the \"balli\" \"Tirsi e Clori\" (1616) and \"Apollo\" (1620), an opera \"Andromeda\" (1620) and an \"intermedio\", \"Le nozze di Tetide\", for the marriage of Ferdinando with Caterina de' Medici (1617). Most of these compositions were extensively delayed in creation \u2013 partly, as shown by surviving correspondence, through the composer's unwillingness to prioritise them, and partly because of constant changes in the court's requirements. They are now lost, apart from \"Tirsi e Clori\", which was included in the seventh book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina, for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the Duchess. A subsequent major commission, the opera \"La finta pazza Licori\", to a libretto by Giulio Strozzi, was completed for Fernando's successor Vincenzo II, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the latter's illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now also lost.\nMonteverdi also received commissions from other Italian states and from their communities in Venice. These included, for the Milanese community in 1620, music for the Feast of St. Charles Borromeo, and for the Florentine community a Requiem Mass for Cosimo II de' Medici (1621). Monteverdi acted on behalf of Paolo Giordano II, Duke of Bracciano, to arrange publication of works by the Cremona musician Francesco Petratti. Among Monteverdi's private Venetian patrons was the nobleman Girolamo Mocenigo, at whose home was premiered in 1624 the dramatic entertainment \"Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda\" based on an episode from Torquato Tasso's \"La Gerusalemme liberata\". In 1627 Monteverdi received a major commission from Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma, for a series of works, and gained leave from the Procurators to spend time there during 1627 and 1628.\nMonteverdi's musical direction received the attention of foreign visitors. The Dutch diplomat and musician Constantijn Huygens, attending a Vespers service at the church of SS. Giovanni e Lucia, wrote that he \"heard the most perfect music I had ever heard in my life. It was directed by the most famous Claudio Monteverdi\u00a0... who was also the composer and was accompanied by four theorbos, two cornettos, two bassoons, one \"basso de viola\" of huge size, organs and other instruments\u00a0...\". Monteverdi wrote a mass, and provided other musical entertainment, for the visit to Venice in 1625 of the Crown Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Poland, who may have sought to revive attempts made a few years previously to lure Monteverdi to Warsaw. He also provided chamber music for Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg, when the latter was paying an incognito visit to Venice in July 1625.\nCorrespondence of Monteverdi in 1625 and 1626 with the Mantuan courtier Ercole Marigliani reveals an interest in alchemy, which apparently Monteverdi had taken up as a hobby. He discusses experiments to transform lead into gold, the problems of obtaining mercury, and mentions commissioning special vessels for his experiments from the glassworks at Murano.\nDespite his generally satisfactory situation in Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems from time to time. He was on one occasion \u2013 probably because of his wide network of contacts \u2013 the subject of an anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he, therefore, moved him to the University of Bologna. This did not have the required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career \u2013 he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church canonry.\nPause: 1630\u20131637.\nA series of disturbing events troubled Monteverdi's world in the period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and over a period of 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.\nBy this time Monteverdi was in his sixties, and his rate of composition seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's \"Proserpina rapita (The Abduction of Proserpina)\", now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of \"Scherzi musicali\" was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi was admitted to the tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated as a member of the clergy of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.\nLate flowering: 1637\u20131643.\nThe opening of the opera house of San Cassiano in 1637, the first public opera house in Europe, stimulated the city's musical life and coincided with a new burst of the composer's activity. The year 1638 saw the publication of Monteverdi's eighth book of madrigals and a revision of the \"Ballo delle ingrate\". The eighth book contains a \"ballo\", \"Volgendi il ciel\", which may have been composed for the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III, to whom the book is dedicated. The years 1640\u20131641 saw the publication of the extensive collection of church music, \"Selva morale e spirituale\". Among other commissions, Monteverdi wrote music in 1637 and 1638 for Strozzi's \"Accademia degli Unisoni\" in Venice, and in 1641 a ballet, \"La vittoria d'Amore\", for the court of Piacenza.\nMonteverdi was still not entirely free from his responsibilities for the musicians at San Marco. He wrote to complain about one of his singers to the Procurators, on 9 June 1637: \"I, Claudio Monteverdi\u00a0... come humbly\u00a0... to set forth to you how Domenicato Aldegati\u00a0... a bass, yesterday morning\u00a0... at the time of the greatest concourse of people\u00a0... spoke these exact words\u00a0...'The Director of Music comes from a brood of cut-throat bastards, a thieving, fucking, he-goat\u00a0... and I shit on him and whoever protects him\u00a0...\nMonteverdi's contribution to opera at this period is notable. He revised his earlier opera \"L'Arianna\" in 1640 and wrote three new works for the commercial stage, \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland\", 1640, first performed in Bologna with Venetian singers), \"Le nozze d'Enea e Lavinia (The Marriage of Aeneas and Lavinia\", 1641, music now lost), and \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\" (\"The Coronation of Poppea\", 1643). The introduction to the printed scenario of \"Le nozze d'Enea\", by an unknown author, acknowledges that Monteverdi is to be credited for the rebirth of theatrical music and that \"he will be sighed for in later ages, for his compositions will surely outlive the ravages of time.\"\nIn his last surviving letter (20 August 1643), Monteverdi, already ill, was still hoping for the settlement of the long-disputed pension from Mantua, and asked the Doge of Venice to intervene on his behalf. He died in Venice on 29 November 1643, after paying a brief visit to Cremona, and is buried in the Church of the Frari. He was survived by his sons; Masimilliano died in 1661, Francesco after 1677.\nMusic.\nBackground: Renaissance to Baroque.\nThere is a consensus among music historians that a period extending from the mid-15th century to around 1625, characterised in Lewis Lockwood's phrase by \"substantial unity of outlook and language\", should be identified as the period of \"Renaissance music\". Musical literature has also defined the succeeding period (covering music from approximately 1580 to 1750) as the era of \"Baroque music\". It is in the late-16th to early-17th-century overlap of these periods that much of Monteverdi's creativity flourished; he stands as a transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque.\nIn the Renaissance era, music had developed as a formal discipline, a \"pure science of relationships\" in the words of Lockwood. In the Baroque era it became a form of aesthetic expression, increasingly used to adorn religious, social and festive celebrations in which, in accordance with Plato's ideal, the music was subordinated to the text. Solo singing with instrumental accompaniment, or monody, acquired greater significance towards the end of the 16th century, replacing polyphony as the principal means of dramatic music expression. This was the changing world in which Monteverdi was active. Percy Scholes in his \"Oxford Companion to Music\" describes the \"new music\" thus: \"[Composers] discarded the choral polyphony of the madrigal style as barbaric, and set dialogue or soliloquy for single voices, imitating more or less the inflexions of speech and accompanying the voice by playing mere supporting chords. Short choruses were interspersed, but they too were homophonic rather than polyphonic.\"\nNovice years: Madrigal books 1 and 2.\nIngegneri, Monteverdi's first tutor, was a master of the \"musica reservata\" vocal style, which involved the use of chromatic progressions and word-painting; Monteverdi's early compositions were grounded in this style. Ingegneri was a traditional Renaissance composer, \"something of an anachronism\", according to Arnold, but Monteverdi also studied the work of more \"modern\" composers such as Luca Marenzio, Luzzasco Luzzaschi, and a little later, Giaches de Wert, from whom he would learn the art of expressing passion. He was a precocious and productive student, as indicated by his youthful publications of 1582\u201383. Paul Ringer writes that \"these teenaged efforts reveal palpable ambition matched with a convincing mastery of contemporary style\", but at this stage they display their creator's competence rather than any striking originality. Geoffrey Chew classifies them as \"not in the most modern vein for the period\", acceptable but out-of-date. Chew rates the \"Canzonette\" collection of 1584 much more highly than the earlier juvenilia: \"These brief three-voice pieces draw on the airy, modern style of the villanellas of Marenzio, [drawing on] a substantial vocabulary of text-related madrigalisms\".\nThe canzonetta form was much used by composers of the day as a technical exercise, and is a prominent element in Monteverdi's first book of madrigals published in 1587. In this book, the playful, pastoral settings again reflect the style of Marenzio, while Luzzaschi's influence is evident in Monteverdi's use of dissonance. The second book (1590) begins with a setting modelled on Marenzio of a modern verse, Torquato Tasso's \"Non si levav' ancor\", and concludes with a text from 50 years earlier: Pietro Bembo's \"Cantai un tempo\". Monteverdi set the latter to music in an archaic style reminiscent of the long-dead Cipriano de Rore. Between them is \"Ecco mormorar l'onde\", strongly influenced by de Wert and hailed by Chew as the great masterpiece of the second book.\nA thread common throughout these early works is Monteverdi's use of the technique of \"imitatio\", a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.\nMadrigals 1590\u20131605: books 3, 4, 5.\nMonteverdi's first fifteen years of service in Mantua are bracketed by his publications of the third book of madrigals in 1592 and the fourth and fifth books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies. How much he composed in this period is a matter of conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.\nThe third book shows strongly the increased influence of Wert, by that time Monteverdi's direct superior as \"maestro de capella\" at Mantua. Two poets dominate the collection: Tasso, whose lyrical poetry had figured prominently in the second book but is here represented through the more epic, heroic verses from \"Gerusalemme liberata\", and Giovanni Battista Guarini, whose verses had appeared sporadically in Monteverdi's earlier publications, but form around half of the contents of the third book. Wert's influence is reflected in Monteverdi's forthrightly modern approach, and his expressive and chromatic settings of Tasso's verses. Of the Guarini settings, Chew writes: \"The epigrammatic style\u00a0... closely matches a poetic and musical ideal of the period\u00a0... [and] often depends on strong, final cadential progressions, with or without the intensification provided by chains of suspended dissonances\". Chew cites the setting of \"Stracciami pur il core\" as \"a prime example of Monteverdi's irregular dissonance practice\". Tasso and Guarini were both regular visitors to the Mantuan court; Monteverdi's association with them and his absorption of their ideas may have helped lay the foundations of his own approach to the musical dramas that he would create a decade later.\nAs the 1590s progressed, Monteverdi moved closer towards the form that he would identify in due course as the \"seconda pratica\". Claude V. Palisca quotes the madrigal \"Ohim\u00e8, se tanto amate\", published in the fourth book but written before 1600 \u2013 it is among the works attacked by Artusi \u2013 as a typical example of the composer's developing powers of invention. In this madrigal Monteverdi again departs from the established practice in the use of dissonance, by means of a vocal ornament Palisca describes as \"\u00e9chapp\u00e9\". Monteverdi's daring use of this device is, says Palisca, \"like a forbidden pleasure\". In this and in other settings the poet's images were supreme, even at the expense of musical consistency.\nThe fourth book includes madrigals to which Artusi objected on the grounds of their \"modernism\". However, Ossi describes it as \"an anthology of disparate works firmly rooted in the 16th century\", closer in nature to the third book than to the fifth. Besides Tasso and Guarini, Monteverdi set to music verses by Rinuccini, Maurizio Moro (\"S\u00ec ch'io vorrei morire\") and Ridolfo Arlotti (\"Luci serene e chiare\"). There is evidence of the composer's familiarity with the works of Carlo Gesualdo, and with composers of the school of Ferrara such as Luzzaschi; the book was dedicated to a Ferrarese musical society, the \"Accademici Intrepidi\".\nThe fifth book looks more to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the \"concertato\" style with basso continuo (a device that was to become a typical feature in the emergent Baroque era), and includes a \"sinfonia\" (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. He presents his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.\nAquilino Coppini drew much of the music for his sacred contrafacta of 1608 from Monteverdi's 3rd, 4th and 5th books of madrigals. In writing to a friend in 1609 Coppini commented that Monteverdi's pieces \"require, during their performance, more flexible rests and bars that are not strictly regular, now pressing forward or abandoning themselves to slowing down [...] In them there is a truly wondrous capacity for moving the affections\".\nOpera and sacred music, 1607\u20131612.\nIn Monteverdi's final five years' service in Mantua he completed the operas \"L'Orfeo\" (1607) and \"L'Arianna\" (1608), and wrote quantities of sacred music, including the \"Messa in illo tempore\" (1610) and also the collection known as \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\" which is often referred to as \"Monteverdi's \"Vespers\"\" (1610). He also published \"Scherzi musicale a tre voci\" (1607), settings of verses composed since 1599 and dedicated to the Gonzaga heir, Francesco. The vocal trio in the \"Scherzi\" comprises two sopranos and a bass, accompanied by simple instrumental ritornellos. According to Bowers the music \"reflected the modesty of the prince's resources; it was, nevertheless, the earliest publication to associate voices and instruments in this particular way\".\n\"L'Orfeo\".\nThe opera opens with a brief trumpet toccata. The prologue of La musica (a figure representing music) is introduced with a ritornello by the strings, repeated often to represent the \"power of music\" \u2013 one of the earliest examples of an operatic leitmotif. Act 1 presents a pastoral idyll, the buoyant mood of which continues into Act 2. The confusion and grief which follow the news of Euridice's death are musically reflected by harsh dissonances and the juxtaposition of keys. The music remains in this vein until the act ends with the consoling sounds of the ritornello.\nAct 3 is dominated by Orfeo's aria \"Possente spirto e formidabil nume\" by which he attempts to persuade Caronte to allow him to enter Hades. Monteverdi's vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Tim Carter has described as \"one of the most compelling visual and aural representations\" in early opera. In Act 4 the warmth of Proserpina's singing on behalf of Orfeo is retained until Orfeo fatally \"looks back\". The brief final act, which sees Orfeo's rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of the ritornello and by a lively moresca that brings the audience back to their everyday world.\nThroughout the opera Monteverdi makes innovative use of polyphony, extending the rules beyond the conventions which composers normally observed in fidelity to Palestrina. He combines elements of the traditional 16th-century madrigal with the new monodic style where the text dominates the music and sinfonias and instrumental ritornellos illustrate the action.\n\"L'Arianna\".\nThe music for this opera is lost except for the \"Lamento d'Arianna\", which was published in the sixth book in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal; a separate monodic version was published in 1623. In its operatic context the lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Throughout, indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until a descending line brings the piece to a quiet conclusion.\nThe musicologist Suzanne Cusick writes that Monteverdi \"creat[ed] the lament as a recognizable genre of vocal chamber music and as a standard scene in opera\u00a0... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice\". Cusick observes how Monteverdi is able to match in music the \"rhetorical and syntactical gestures\" in the text of Ottavio Rinuccini. The opening repeated words \"Lasciatemi morire\" (Let me die) are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as \"an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain\". Ringer suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi's innovative creativity in a manner similar to that in which the Prelude and the Liebestod in \"Tristan und Isolde\" announced Wagner's discovery of new expressive frontiers.\nRinuccini's full libretto, which has survived, was set in modern times by Alexander Goehr (\"Arianna\", 1995), including a version of Monteverdi's \"Lament\".\nVespers.\nThe \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\", Monteverdi's first published sacred music since the \"Madrigali spirituali\" of 1583, consists of 14 components: an introductory versicle and response, five psalms interspersed with five \"sacred concertos\" (Monteverdi's term), a hymn, and two Magnificat settings. Collectively these pieces fulfil the requirements for a Vespers service on any feast day of the Virgin. Monteverdi employs many musical styles; the more traditional features, such as cantus firmus, falsobordone and Venetian canzone, are mixed with the latest madrigal style, including echo effects and chains of dissonances. Some of the musical features used are reminiscent of \"L'Orfeo\", written slightly earlier for similar instrumental and vocal forces.\nIn this work the \"sacred concertos\" fulfil the role of the antiphons which divide the psalms in regular Vespers services. Their non-liturgical character has led writers to question whether they should be within the service, or indeed whether this was Monteverdi's intention. In some versions of Monteverdi's \"Vespers\" (for example, those of Denis Stevens) the concertos are replaced with antiphons associated with the Virgin, although John Whenham in his analysis of the work argues that the collection as a whole should be regarded as a single liturgical and artistic entity.\nAll the psalms, and the Magnificat, are based on melodically limited and repetitious Gregorian chant psalm tones, around which Monteverdi builds a range of innovative textures. This concertato style challenges the traditional cantus firmus, and is most evident in the \"Sonata sopra Sancta Maria\", written for eight string and wind instruments plus basso continuo, and a single soprano voice. Monteverdi uses modern rhythms, frequent metre changes and constantly varying textures; yet, according to John Eliot Gardiner, \"for all the virtuosity of its instrumental writing and the evident care which has gone into the combinations of timbre\", Monteverdi's chief concern was resolving the proper combination of words and music.\nThe actual musical ingredients of the Vespers were not novel to Mantua \u2013 concertato had been used by Lodovico Grossi da Viadana, a former choirmaster at the cathedral of Mantua, while the \"Sonata sopra\" had been anticipated by Archangelo Crotti in his \"Sancta Maria\" published in 1608. It is, writes Denis Arnold, Monteverdi's mixture of the various elements that makes the music unique. Arnold adds that the Vespers achieved fame and popularity only after their 20th-century rediscovery; they were not particularly regarded in Monteverdi's time.\nMadrigals 1614\u20131638: books 6, 7 and 8.\nSixth book.\nDuring his years in Venice Monteverdi published his sixth (1614), seventh (1619) and eighth (1638) books of madrigals. The sixth book consists of works written before the composer's departure from Mantua. Hans Redlich sees it as a transitional work, containing Monteverdi's last madrigal compositions in the manner of the \"prima pratica\", together with music which is typical of the new style of expression which Monteverdi had displayed in the dramatic works of 1607\u201308. The central theme of the collection is loss; the best-known work is the five-voice version of the \"Lamento d'Arianna\", which, says Massimo Ossi, gives \"an object lesson in the close relationship between monodic recitative and counterpoint\". The book contains Monteverdi's first settings of verses by Giambattista Marino, and two settings of Petrarch which Ossi considers the most extraordinary pieces in the volume, providing some \"stunning musical moments\".\nSeventh book.\nWhile Monteverdi had looked backwards in the sixth book, he moved forward in the seventh book from the traditional concept of the madrigal, and from monody, in favour of chamber duets. There are exceptions, such the two solo \"lettere amorose\" (love letters) \"Se i languidi miei sguardi\" and \"Se pur destina e vole\", written to be performed \"genere rapresentativo\" \u2013 acted as well as sung. Of the duets which are the main features of the volume, Chew highlights \"Ohim\u00e9, dov'\u00e8 il mio ben, dov'\u00e8 il mio core\", a romanesca in which two high voices express dissonances above a repetitive bass pattern. The book also contains large-scale ensemble works, and the ballet \"Tirsi e Clori\". This was the height of Monteverdi's \"Marino period\"; six of the pieces in the book are settings of the poet's verses. As Carter puts it, Monteverdi \"embraced Marino's madrigalian kisses and love-bites with\u00a0... the enthusiasm typical of the period\". Some commentators have opined that the composer should have had better poetic taste.\nEighth book.\nThe eighth book, subtitled \"Madrigali guerrieri, et amorosi\u00a0...\" (\"Madrigals of war and love\") is structured in two symmetrical halves, one for \"war\" and one for \"love\". Each half begins with a six-voice setting, followed by an equally large-scale Petrarch setting, then a series of duets mainly for tenor voices, and concludes with a theatrical number and a final ballet. The \"war\" half contains several items written as tributes to the emperor Ferdinand III, who had succeeded to the Habsburg throne in 1637. Many of Monteverdi's familiar poets \u2013 Strozzi, Rinuccini, Tasso, Marino, Guarini \u2013 are represented in the settings.\nIt is difficult to gauge when many of the pieces were composed, although the ballet \"Mascherata dell' ingrate\" that ends the book dates back to 1608 and the celebration of the Gonzaga-Savoy marriage. The \"Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda\", centrepiece of the \"war\" settings, had been written and performed in Venice in 1624; on its publication in the eighth book, Monteverdi explicitly linked it to his concept of \"concitato genera\" (otherwise \"stile concitato\" \u2013 \"aroused style\") that would \"fittingly imitate the utterance and the accents of a brave man who is engaged in warfare\", and implied that since he had originated this style, others had begun to copy it. The work employed for the first time instructions for the use of pizzicato string chords, and also evocations of fanfares and other sounds of combat.\nThe critic Andrew Clements describes the eighth book as \"a statement of artistic principles and compositional authority\", in which Monteverdi \"shaped and expanded the madrigal form to accommodate what he wanted to do\u00a0... the pieces collected in Book Eight make up a treasury of what music in the first half the 17th century could possibly express.\"\nOther Venetian music, 1614\u20131638.\nDuring this period of his Venetian residency, Monteverdi composed quantities of sacred music. Numerous motets and other short works were included in anthologies by local publishers such as Giulio Cesare Bianchi (a former student of Monteverdi) and Lorenzo Calvi, and others were published elsewhere in Italy and Austria. \nThe range of styles in the motets is broad, from simple strophic arias with string accompaniment to full-scale declamations with an alleluia finale.\nMonteverdi retained emotional and political attachments to the Mantuan court and wrote for it, or undertook to write, large amounts of stage music including at least four operas. The ballet \"Tirsi e Clori\" survives through its inclusion in the seventh book, but the rest of the Mantuan dramatic music is lost. Many of the missing manuscripts may have disappeared in the wars that overcame Mantua in 1630. The most significant aspect of their loss, according to Carter, is the extent to which they might have provided musical links between Monteverdi's early Mantuan operas and those he wrote in Venice after 1638: \"Without these links\u00a0... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage\". Likewise, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical early years.\nApart from the madrigal books, Monteverdi's only published collection during this period was the volume of \"Scherzi musicale\" in 1632. For unknown reasons, the composer's name does not appear on the inscription, the dedication being signed by the Venetian printer Bartolemeo Magni; Carter surmises that the recently ordained Monteverdi may have wished to keep his distance from this secular collection. It mixes strophic continuo songs for solo voice with more complex works which employ continuous variation over repeated bass patterns. Chew selects the chaconne for two tenors, \"Zefiro torna e di soavi accenti\", as the outstanding item in the collection: \"[T]he greater part of this piece consists of repetitions of a bass pattern which ensures tonal unity of a simple kind, owing to its being framed as a simple cadence in a G major tonal type: over these repetitions, inventive variations unfold in virtuoso passage-work\".\nLate operas and final works.\n\"Main articles\": \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\"; \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\"; \"Selva morale e spirituale\"\nThe last years of Monteverdi's life were much occupied with opera for the Venetian stage. Richard Taruskin, in his \"Oxford History of Western Music\", gives his chapter on this topic the title \"Opera from Monteverdi to Monteverdi.\" This wording, originally proposed humorously by the Italian music historian Nino Pirrotta, is interpreted seriously by Taruskin as indicating that Monteverdi is significantly responsible for the transformation of the opera genre from a private entertainment of the nobility (as with \"Orfeo\" in 1607), to what became a major commercial genre, as exemplified by his opera \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\" (1643). His two surviving operatic works of this period, \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\" and \"L'incoronazione\" are held by Arnold to be the first \"modern\" operas; \"Il ritorno\" is the first Venetian opera to depart from what Ellen Rosand terms \"the mythological pastoral\". However, David Johnson in \"The North American Review\" warns audiences not to expect immediate affinity with Mozart, Verdi or Puccini: \"You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence.\"\n\"Il ritorno\", says Carter, is clearly influenced by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from \"L'Arianna\", while the martial episodes recall \"Il combattimento\". \"Stile concitato\" is prominent in the fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In \"L'incoronazione\", Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; \"stile concitato\" represents rage. There is continuing debate about how much of the extant \"L'incoronazione\" music is Monteverdi's original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).\nThe \"Selva morale e spirituale\" of 1641, and the posthumous \"Messa et salmi\" published in 1650 (which was edited by Cavalli), are selections of the sacred music that Monteverdi wrote for San Marco during his 30-year tenure \u2013 much else was likely written but not published. The \"Selva morale\" volume opens with a series of madrigal settings on moral texts, dwelling on themes such as \"the transitory nature of love, earthly rank and achievement, even existence itself\". They are followed by a Mass in conservative style (\"stile antico\"), the high point of which is an extended seven-voice \"Gloria\". Scholars believe that this might have been written to celebrate the end of the 1631 plague. The rest of the volume is made up of numerous psalm settings, two Magnificats and three \"Salve Reginas\". The \"Messa et salmi\" volume includes a \"stile antico\" Mass for four voices, a polyphonic setting of the psalm \"Laetatus Sum\", and a version of the Litany of Lareto that Monteverdi had originally published in 1620.\nThe posthumous ninth book of madrigals was published in 1651, a miscellany dating back to the early 1630s, some items being repeats of previously published pieces, such as the popular duet \"O sia tranquillo il mare\" from 1638. The book includes a trio for three sopranos, \"Come dolce oggi l'auretta\", which is the only surviving music from the 1630 lost opera \"Proserpina rapita\".\nHistorical perspective.\nIn his lifetime Monteverdi enjoyed considerable status among musicians and the public. This is evidenced by the scale of his funeral rites: \"[W]ith truly royal pomp a catafalque was erected in the Chiesa de Padrini Minori de Frari, decorated all in mourning, but surrounded with so many candles that the church resembled a night sky luminous with stars\". This glorification was transitory; Carter writes that in Monteverdi's day, music rarely survived beyond the circumstances of its initial performance and was quickly forgotten along with its creator. In this regard Monteverdi fared better than most. His operatic works were revived in several cities in the decade following his death; according to Severo Bonini, writing in 1651, every musical household in Italy possessed a copy of the \"Lamento d'Arianna\".\nThe German composer Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, who had studied in Venice under Giovanni Gabrieli shortly before Monteverdi's arrival there, possessed a copy of \"Il combattimento\" and himself took up elements of the \"stile concitato\". On his second visit to Venice in 1628\u20131629, Arnold believes, Sch\u00fctz absorbed the concepts of \"basso continuo\" and expressiveness of word-setting, but he opines that Sch\u00fctz was more directly influenced by the style of the younger generation of Venetian composers, including Grandi and Giovanni Rovetta (the eventual successor to Monteverdi at San Marco). Sch\u00fctz published a first book of \"Symphoniae sacrae\", settings of biblical texts in the style of \"seconda pratica\", in Venice in 1629. \"Es steh Gott auf\", from his \"Symphoniae sacrae II\", published in Dresden in 1647, contains specific quotations from Monteverdi.\nAfter the 1650s, Monteverdi's name quickly disappears from contemporary accounts, his music generally forgotten except for the \"Lamento\", the prototype of a genre that would endure well into the 18th century.\nInterest in Monteverdi revived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among music scholars in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the \"Orfeo\" score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following the discovery of the \"L'incoronazione\" manuscript in 1888 and that of \"Il ritorno\" in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or another, during the first quarter of the 20th century: \"L'Orfeo\" in May 1911, \"L'incoronazione\" in February 1913 and \"Il ritorno\" in May 1925.\nThe Italian nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio lauded Monteverdi and in his novel \"Il fuoco\" (1900) wrote of \"\"il divino Claudio\"\u00a0... what a heroic soul, purely Italian in its essence!\" His vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism was adopted by musicians who worked with the regime of Benito Mussolini (1922\u20131945), including Gian Francesco Malipiero, Luigi Dallapiccola, and Mario Labroca, who contrasted Monteverdi with the decadence of the music of Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky.\nIn the years after the Second World War the operas began to be performed in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 \"Vespers\" were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later. Modern editions of the \"Selva morale\" and \"Missa e Salmi\" volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.\nThe revival of public interest in Monteverdi's music gathered pace in the second half of the 20th century, reaching full spate in the general early-music revival of the 1970s, during which time the emphasis turned increasingly towards \"authentic\" performance using historical instruments. The magazine \"Gramophone\" notes over 30 recordings of the \"Vespers\" between 1976 and 2011, and 27 of \"Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda\" between 1971 and 2013. Monteverdi's surviving operas are today regularly performed; the website Operabase notes 555 performances of the operas in 149 productions worldwide in the seasons 2011\u20132016, ranking Monteverdi at 30th position for all composers, and at 8th ranking for Italian opera composers. In 1985, Manfred H. Stattkus published an index to Monteverdi's works, the Stattkus-Verzeichnis, (revised in 2006) giving each composition an \"SV\" number, to be used for cataloguing and references.\nMonteverdi is lauded by modern critics as \"the most significant composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy\"; \"one of the principal composers in the history of Western music\"; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers who followed him during an extensive period, spanning more than two centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the 20th and 21st century who have rediscovered Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi's reputation as \"a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority\" \u2013 although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, \"showing what can only be described as an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose\". In a letter dated 16 October 1633, Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a \"modern\": \"I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary\". However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but while at the same time protective of his status as a competent composer in the \"stile antico\". Thus, says Chew, \"his achievement was both retrospective and progressive\". Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. \"And in one respect in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music.\""}

{"id": "6229", "revid": "25093804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6229", "title": "Colossus computer", "text": "Colossus was a set of computers developed by British codebreakers in the years 1943\u20131945 to help in the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher. Colossus used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) to perform Boolean and counting operations. Colossus is thus regarded as the world's first programmable, electronic, digital computer, although it was programmed by switches and plugs and not by a stored program.\nColossus was designed by General Post Office (GPO) research telephone engineer Tommy Flowers to solve a problem posed by mathematician Max Newman at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park. Alan Turing's use of probability in cryptanalysis (see Banburismus) contributed to its design. It has sometimes been erroneously stated that Turing designed Colossus to aid the cryptanalysis of the Enigma. Turing's machine that helped decode Enigma was the electromechanical Bombe, not Colossus.\nThe prototype, Colossus Mark 1, was shown to be working in December 1943 and was in use at Bletchley Park by early 1944. An improved Colossus Mark 2 that used shift registers to quintuple the processing speed, first worked on 1 June 1944, just in time for the Normandy landings on D-Day. Ten Colossi were in use by the end of the war and an eleventh was being commissioned. Bletchley Park's use of these machines allowed the Allies to obtain a vast amount of high-level military intelligence from intercepted radiotelegraphy messages between the German High Command (\"OKW\") and their army commands throughout occupied Europe.\nThe existence of the Colossus machines was kept secret until the mid-1970s; the machines and the plans for building them had previously been destroyed in the 1960s, as part of the effort to maintain the secrecy of the project. This deprived most of those involved with Colossus of the credit for pioneering electronic digital computing during their lifetimes. A functioning rebuild of a Mark 2 Colossus was completed in 2008 by Tony Sale and some volunteers; it is on display at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park.\nPurpose and origins.\nThe Colossus computers were used to help decipher intercepted radio teleprinter messages that had been encrypted using an unknown device. Intelligence information revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems \"S\u00e4gefisch\" (sawfish). This led the British to call encrypted German teleprinter traffic \"Fish\", and the unknown machine and its intercepted messages \"Tunny\" (tunafish).\nBefore the Germans increased the security of their operating procedures, British cryptanalysts diagnosed how the unseen machine functioned and built an imitation of it called \"British Tunny\".\nIt was deduced that the machine had twelve wheels and used a Vernam ciphering technique on message characters in the standard 5-bit ITA2 telegraph code. It did this by combining the plaintext characters with a stream of key characters using the XOR Boolean function to produce the ciphertext.\nIn August 1941, a blunder by German operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings. These were intercepted and worked on at Bletchley Park. First, John Tiltman, a very talented GC&amp;CS cryptanalyst, derived a key stream of almost 4000 characters. Then Bill Tutte, a newly arrived member of the Research Section, used this keystream to work out the logical structure of the Lorenz machine. He deduced that the twelve wheels consisted of two groups of five, which he named the \u03c7 (\"chi\") and \u03c8 (\"psi\") wheels, the remaining two he called \u03bc (\"mu\") or \"motor\" wheels. The \"chi\" wheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while the \"psi\" wheels stepped irregularly, under the control of the motor wheels.\nWith a sufficiently random keystream, a Vernam cipher removes the natural language property of a plaintext message of having an uneven frequency distribution of the different characters, to produce a uniform distribution in the ciphertext. The Tunny machine did this well. However, the cryptanalysts worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character-to-character changes in the ciphertext, instead of the plain characters, there was a departure from uniformity which provided a way into the system. This was achieved by \"differencing\" in which each bit or character was XOR-ed with its successor. After Germany surrendered, allied forces captured a Tunny machine and discovered that it was the electromechanical Lorenz SZ (\"Schl\u00fcsselzusatzger\u00e4t\", cipher attachment) in-line cipher machine.\nIn order to decrypt the transmitted messages, two tasks had to be performed. The first was \"wheel breaking\", which was the discovery of the cam patterns for all the wheels. These patterns were set up on the Lorenz machine and then used for a fixed period of time for a succession of different messages. Each transmission, which often contained more than one message, was enciphered with a different start position of the wheels. Alan Turing invented a method of wheel-breaking that became known as Turingery. Turing's technique was further developed into \"Rectangling\", for which Colossus could produce tables for manual analysis. Colossi 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 had a \"gadget\" to aid this process.\nThe second task was \"wheel setting\", which worked out the start positions of the wheels for a particular message, and could only be attempted once the cam patterns were known. It was this task for which Colossus was initially designed. To discover the start position of the \"chi\" wheels for a message, Colossus compared two character streams, counting statistics from the evaluation of programmable Boolean functions. The two streams were the ciphertext, which was read at high speed from a paper tape, and the key stream, which was generated internally, in a simulation of the unknown German machine. After a succession of different Colossus runs to discover the likely \"chi\"-wheel settings, they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in processed ciphertext. Colossus produced these frequency counts.\nDecryption processes.\nBy using differencing and knowing that the \"psi\" wheels did not advance with each character, Tutte worked out that trying just two differenced bits (impulses) of the \"chi\"-stream against the differenced ciphertext would produce a statistic that was non-random. This became known as Tutte's \"1+2 break in\". It involved calculating the following Boolean function:\nand counting the number of times it yielded \"false\" (zero). If this number exceeded a pre-defined threshold value known as the \"set total\", it was printed out. The cryptanalyst would examine the printout to determine which of the putative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for the \"chi\"-1 and \"chi\"-2 wheels.\nThis technique would then be applied to other pairs of, or single, impulses to determine the likely start position of all five \"chi\" wheels. From this, the de-\"chi\" (D) of a ciphertext could be obtained, from which the \"psi\" component could be removed by manual methods. If the frequency distribution of characters in the de-\"chi\" version of the ciphertext was within certain bounds, \"wheel setting\" of the \"chi\" wheels was considered to have been achieved, and the message settings and de-\"chi\" were passed to the \"Testery\". This was the section at Bletchley Park led by Major Ralph Tester where the bulk of the decrypting work was done by manual and linguistic methods.\nColossus could also derive the start position of the \"psi\" and motor wheels, but this was not much done until the last few months of the war, when there were plenty of Colossi available and the number of Tunny messages had declined.\nDesign and construction.\nColossus was developed for the \"Newmanry\", the section headed by the mathematician Max Newman that was responsible for machine methods against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ40/42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine (code named Tunny, for tunafish). The Colossus design arose out of a prior project that produced a counting machine dubbed \"Heath Robinson\". Although it proved the concept of machine analysis for this part of the process, it was initially unreliable. The electro-mechanical parts were relatively slow and it was difficult to synchronise two looped paper tapes, one containing the enciphered message, and the other representing part of the key stream of the Lorenz machine, also the tapes tended to stretch when being read at up to 2000 characters per second.\nTommy Flowers MBE was a senior electrical engineer and Head of the Switching Group at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill. Prior to his work on Colossus, he had been involved with GC&amp;CS at Bletchley Park from February 1941 in an attempt to improve the Bombes that were used in the cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher machine. He was recommended to Max Newman by Alan Turing, who had been impressed by his work on the Bombes. The main components of the Heath Robinson machine were as follows.\nFlowers had been brought in to design the Heath Robinson combining unit. He was not impressed by the system of a key tape that had to be kept synchronised with the message tape and, on his own initiative, he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the Lorenz (Tunny) machine. He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves (vacuum tubes and thyratrons) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism, so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill. Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred as a result of the thermal stresses at power up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels. Additionally, the heaters were started at a low voltage then slowly brought up to full voltage to reduce the thermal stress. The valves themselves were soldered in to avoid problems with plug-in bases, which could be unreliable. Flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station, W Gordon Radley. Flowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building a machine that dispensed with the second tape of the Heath Robinson, by generating the wheel patterns electronically. Flowers used some of his own money for the project.\nThis prototype, Mark 1 Colossus, contained 1600 thermionic valves (tubes). It performed satisfactorily at Dollis Hill on 8 December 1943 and was dismantled and shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January and re-assembled by Harry Fensom and Don Horwood. It was operational in January and it successfully attacked its first message on 5 February 1944. It was a large structure and was dubbed 'Colossus', supposedly by the WRNS operators. However, a memo held in the National Archives written by Max Newman on 18 January 1944 records that 'Colossus arrives today\".\nDuring the development of the prototype, an improved design had been developed \u2013 the Mark 2 Colossus. Four of these were ordered in March 1944 and by the end of April the number on order had been increased to twelve. Dollis Hill was put under pressure to have the first of these working by 1 June. Allen Coombs took over leadership of the production Mark 2 Colossi, the first of which \u2013 containing 2400 valves \u2013 became operational at 08:00 on 1 June 1944, just in time for the Allied Invasion of Normandy on D-Day. Subsequently, Colossi were delivered at the rate of about one a month. By the time of V-E Day there were ten Colossi working at Bletchley Park and a start had been made on assembling an eleventh.\nThe main units of the Mark 2 design were as follows.\nMost of the design of the electronics was the work of Tommy Flowers, assisted by William Chandler, Sidney Broadhurst and Allen Coombs; with Erie Speight and Arnold Lynch developing the photoelectric reading mechanism. Coombs remembered Flowers, having produced a rough draft of his design, tearing it into pieces that he handed out to his colleagues for them to do the detailed design and get their team to manufacture it. The Mark 2 Colossi were both five times faster and were simpler to operate than the prototype.\nData input to Colossus was by photoelectric reading of a paper tape transcription of the enciphered intercepted message. This was arranged in a continuous loop so that it could be read and re-read multiple times \u2013 there being no internal storage for the data. The design overcame the problem of synchronizing the electronics with the speed of the message tape, by generating a clock signal from reading its sprocket holes. The speed of operation was thus limited by the mechanics of reading the tape. During development, the tape reader was tested up to 9700 characters per second (53\u00a0mph) before the tape disintegrated. So 5000 characters/second () was settled on as the speed for regular use. Flowers designed a 6-character shift register, which was used both for computing the delta function (\u0394Z) and for testing five different possible starting points of Tunny's wheels in the five processors. This five-way parallelism enabled five simultaneous tests and counts to be performed giving an effective processing speed of 25,000 characters per second. The computation used algorithms devised by W. T. Tutte and colleagues to decrypt a Tunny message.\nOperation.\nThe Newmanry was staffed by cryptanalysts, operators from the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) \u2013 known as \"Wrens\" \u2013 and engineers who were permanently on hand for maintenance and repair. By the end of the war the staffing was 272 Wrens and 27 men.\nThe first job in operating Colossus for a new message was to prepare the paper tape loop. This was performed by the Wrens who stuck the two ends together using Bostik glue, ensuring that there was a 150-character length of blank tape between the end and the start of the message. Using a special hand punch they inserted a start hole between the third and fourth channels sprocket holes from the end of the blank section, and a stop hole between the fourth and fifth channels sprocket holes from the end of the characters of the message. These were read by specially positioned photocells and indicated when the message was about to start and when it ended. The operator would then thread the paper tape through the gate and around the pulleys of the bedstead and adjust the tension. The two-tape bedstead design had been carried on from Heath Robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run. A switch on the Selection Panel specified the \"near\" or the \"far\" tape.\nAfter performing various resetting and zeroizing tasks, the Wren operators would, under instruction from the cryptanalyst, operate the \"set total\" decade switches and the K2 panel switches to set the desired algorithm. They would then start the bedstead tape motor and lamp and, when the tape was up to speed, operate the master start switch.\nProgramming.\nHoward Campaigne, a mathematician and cryptanalyst from the US Navy's OP-20-G, wrote the following in a foreword to Flowers' 1983 paper \"The Design of Colossus\".\nColossus was not a stored-program computer. The input data for the five parallel processors was read from the looped message paper tape and the electronic pattern generators for the \"chi\", \"psi\" and motor wheels. The programs for the processors were set and held on the switches and jack panel connections. Each processor could evaluate a Boolean function and count and display the number of times it yielded the specified value of \"false\" (0) or \"true\" (1) for each pass of the message tape.\nInput to the processors came from two sources, the shift registers from tape reading and the thyratron rings that emulated the wheels of the Tunny machine. The characters on the paper tape were called Z and the characters from the Tunny emulator were referred to by the Greek letters that Bill Tutte had given them when working out the logical structure of the machine. On the selection panel, switches specified either Z or \u0394Z, either formula_2 or \u0394formula_2 and either formula_4 or \u0394formula_4 for the data to be passed to the jack field and 'K2 switch panel'. These signals from the wheel simulators could be specified as stepping on with each new pass of the message tape or not.\nThe K2 switch panel had a group of switches on the left-hand side to specify the algorithm. The switches on the right-hand side selected the counter to which the result was fed. The plugboard allowed less specialized conditions to be imposed. Overall the K2 switch panel switches and the plugboard allowed about five billion different combinations of the selected variables. \nAs an example: a set of runs for a message tape might initially involve two \"chi\" wheels, as in Tutte's 1+2 algorithm. Such a two-wheel run was called a long run, taking on average eight minutes unless the parallelism was utilised to cut the time by a factor of five. The subsequent runs might only involve setting one \"chi\" wheel, giving a short run taking about two minutes. Initially, after the initial long run, the choice of next algorithm to be tried was specified by the cryptanalyst. Experience showed, however, that decision trees for this iterative process could be produced for use by the Wren operators in a proportion of cases.\nInfluence and fate.\nAlthough the Colossus was the first of the electronic digital machines with programmability, albeit limited by modern standards, it was not a general-purpose machine, being designed for a range of cryptanalytic tasks, most involving counting the results of evaluating Boolean algorithms.\nA Colossus computer was thus not a fully Turing complete machine. However, University of San Francisco professor Benjamin Wells has shown that if all ten Colossus machines made were rearranged in a specific cluster, then the entire set of computers could have simulated a universal Turing machine, and thus be Turing complete. The notion of a computer as a general-purpose machine \u2013 that is, as more than a calculator devoted to solving difficult but specific problems \u2013 did not become prominent until after World War II.\nColossus and the reasons for its construction were highly secret and remained so for 30 years after the War. Consequently, it was not included in the history of computing hardware for many years, and Flowers and his associates were deprived of the recognition they were due. Colossi 1 to 10 were dismantled after the war and parts returned to the Post Office. Some parts, sanitised as to their original purpose, were taken to Max Newman's Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University. Tommy Flowers was ordered to destroy all documentation and burnt them in a furnace at Dollis Hill. He later said of that order:\n Colossi 11 and 12, along with two replica Tunny machines, were retained, being moved to GCHQ's new headquarters at Eastcote in April 1946, and again with GCHQ to Cheltenham between 1952 and 1954. One of the Colossi, known as \"Colossus Blue\", was dismantled in 1959; the other in 1960. There had been attempts to adapt them to other purposes, with varying success; in their later years they had been used for training. Jack Good related how he was the first to use Colossus after the war, persuading the US National Security Agency that it could be used to perform a function for which they were planning to build a special-purpose machine. Colossus was also used to perform character counts on one-time pad tape to test for non-randomness.\nA small number of people who were associated with Colossus\u2014and knew that large-scale, reliable, high-speed electronic digital computing devices were feasible\u2014played significant roles in early computer work in the UK and probably in the US. However, being so secret, it had little direct influence on the development of later computers; it was EDVAC that was the seminal computer architecture of the time. In 1972 Herman Goldstine, who was unaware of Colossus and its legacy to the projects of people such as Alan Turing (ACE), Max Newman (Manchester computers) and Harry Huskey (Bendix G-15), wrote that,\nProfessor Brian Randell, who unearthed information about Colossus in the 1970s, commented on this, saying that:\nRandell's efforts started to bear fruit in the mid-1970s, after the secrecy about Bletchley Park was broken when Group Captain Winterbotham published his book \"The Ultra Secret\" in 1974. In October 2000, a 500-page technical report on the Tunny cipher and its cryptanalysis\u2014entitled \"General Report on Tunny\"\u2014was released by GCHQ to the national Public Record Office, and it contains a fascinating paean to Colossus by the cryptographers who worked with it:\nReconstruction.\nConstruction of a fully functional rebuild of a Colossus Mark 2 was undertaken between 1993 and 2008 by a team led by Tony Sale. In spite of the blueprints and hardware being destroyed, a surprising amount of material survived, mainly in engineers' notebooks, but a considerable amount of it in the U.S. The optical tape reader might have posed the biggest problem, but Dr. Arnold Lynch, its original designer was able to redesign it to his own original specification. The reconstruction is on display, in the historically correct place for Colossus No. 9, at The National Museum of Computing, in H Block Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.\nIn November 2007, to celebrate the project completion and to mark the start of a fundraising initiative for The National Museum of Computing, a Cipher Challenge pitted the rebuilt Colossus against radio amateurs worldwide in being first to receive and decode three messages enciphered using the Lorenz SZ42 and transmitted from radio station DL0HNF in the \"Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum\" computer museum. The challenge was easily won by radio amateur Joachim Sch\u00fcth, who had carefully prepared for the event and developed his own signal processing and code-breaking code using Ada. The Colossus team were hampered by their wish to use World War II radio equipment, delaying them by a day because of poor reception conditions. Nevertheless, the victor's 1.4\u00a0GHz laptop, running his own code, took less than a minute to find the settings for all 12 wheels. The German codebreaker said: \"My laptop digested ciphertext at a speed of 1.2\u00a0million characters per second\u2014240 times faster than Colossus. If you scale the CPU frequency by that factor, you get an equivalent clock of 5.8\u00a0MHz for Colossus. That is a remarkable speed for a computer built in 1944.\"\nThe Cipher Challenge verified the successful completion of the rebuild project. \"On the strength of today's performance Colossus is as good as it was six decades ago\", commented Tony Sale. \"We are delighted to have produced a fitting tribute to the people who worked at Bletchley Park and whose brainpower devised these fantastic machines which broke these ciphers and shortened the war by many months.\"\nOther meanings.\nThere was a fictional computer named \"Colossus\" in the 1970 film \"\" which was based on the 1966 novel \"Colossus\" by D. F. Jones. This was a coincidence as it pre-dates the public release of information about Colossus, or even its name.\nNeal Stephenson's novel \"Cryptonomicon\" (1999) also contains a fictional treatment of the historical role played by Turing and Bletchley Park."}
{"id": "6230", "revid": "1011970718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6230", "title": "Canadian Shield", "text": "The Canadian Shield ( ), also called the Laurentian Plateau, is a large area of exposed Precambrian igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks (geologic shield) that forms the ancient geologic core of the North American continent (the North American Craton or Laurentia). Glaciation has left the area with only a thin layer of soil, through which the composition of igneous rock resulting from long volcanic history is frequently visible. As a deep, common, joined bedrock region in eastern and central Canada, the Shield stretches north from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, covering over half of Canada and most of Greenland; it also extends south into the northern reaches of the United States. Human population is sparse and industrial development is minimal, but mining is prevalent.\nGeographical extent.\nThe Canadian Shield is a physiographic division comprising four smaller physiographic provinces: the Laurentian Upland, Kazan Region, Davis and James. The shield extends into the United States as the Adirondack Mountains (connected by the Frontenac Axis) and the Superior Upland. The Canadian Shield is a U-shaped subsection of the Laurentia craton signifying the area of greatest glacial impact (scraping down to bare rock) creating the thin soils. The Canadian Shield is more than 3.96 billion years old. The Canadian Shield once had jagged peaks, higher than any of today's mountains, but millions of years of erosion have changed these mountains to rolling hills.\nThe Canadian Shield is a collage of Archean plates and accreted juvenile arc terranes and sedimentary basins of the Proterozoic Eon that were progressively amalgamated during the interval 2.45\u20131.24 Ga, with the most substantial growth period occurring during the Trans-Hudson orogeny, between ca. 1.90\u20131.80 Ga. The Canadian Shield was the first part of North America to be permanently elevated above sea level and has remained almost wholly untouched by successive encroachments of the sea upon the continent. It is the Earth's greatest area of exposed Archean rock. The metamorphic base rocks are mostly from the Precambrian (between 4.5 billion and 540 million years ago) and have been repeatedly uplifted and eroded. Today it consists largely of an area of low relief above sea level with a few monadnocks and low mountain ranges (including the Laurentian Mountains) probably eroded from the plateau during the Cenozoic Era. During the Pleistocene Epoch, continental ice sheets depressed the land surface (creating Hudson Bay) but also tilted up its northeastern \"rim\" (the Torngat), scooped out thousands of lake basins, and carried away much of the region's soil. The northeastern portion, however, became tilted up so that, in northern Labrador and Baffin Island, the land rises to more than 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) above sea level.\nWhen the Greenland section is included, the Shield is approximately circular, bounded on the northeast by the northeast edge of Greenland, with Hudson Bay in the middle. It covers much of Greenland, all of Labrador and the Great Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland, most of Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River, much of Ontario including northern sections of the Ontario Peninsula, the Adirondack Mountains of New York, the northernmost part of Lower Michigan and all of Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, northeastern Minnesota, the central and northern portions of Manitoba away from Hudson Bay, northern Saskatchewan, a small portion of northeastern Alberta, mainland Northwest Territories to the east of a line extended north from the Saskatchewan-Alberta border, most of Nunavut's mainland and, of its Arctic Archipelago, Baffin Island and significant bands through Somerset, Southampton, Devon and Ellesmere islands. In total, the exposed area of the Shield covers approximately . The true extent of the Shield is greater still and stretches from the Western Cordillera in the west to the Appalachians in the east and as far south as Texas, but these regions are overlaid with much younger rocks and sediment.\nGeology.\nThe Canadian Shield is among the oldest on Earth, with regions dating from 2.5 to 4.2 billion years. The multitude of rivers and lakes in the region is classical example of a deranged drainage system, caused by the watersheds of the area being disturbed by glaciation and the effect of post-glacial rebound. The Shield was originally an area of very large, very tall mountains (about ) with much volcanic activity, but the area was eroded to nearly its current topographic appearance of relatively low relief over 500 million years ago. Erosion has exposed the roots of the mountains, which take the form of greenstone belts in which belts of volcanic rock that has been altered by metamorphism are surrounded by granitic rock. These belts range in age from 3600 to 2680 million years old. Much of the granitic rock belongs to the distinctive tonalite\u2013trondhjemite\u2013granodiorite family of rocks, which are characteristic of Archean continental crust. Many of Canada's major ore deposits are associated with greenstone belts.\nThe Sturgeon Lake Caldera in Kenora District, Ontario, is one of the world's best preserved mineralized Neoarchean caldera complexes, which is 2.7 billion years old. The Canadian Shield also contains the Mackenzie dike swarm, which is the largest dike swarm known on Earth.\nMountains have deep roots and float on the denser mantle much like an iceberg at sea. As mountains erode, their roots rise and are eroded in turn. The rocks that now form the surface of the Shield were once far below the Earth's surface.\nThe high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for mineralization. Although these mountains are now heavily eroded, many large mountains still exist in Canada's far north called the Arctic Cordillera. This is a vast, deeply dissected mountain range, stretching from northernmost Ellesmere Island to the northernmost tip of Labrador. The range's highest peak is Nunavut's Barbeau Peak at above sea level. Precambrian rock is the major component of the bedrock.\nThe North American craton is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton's bedrock.\nThe Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called Arctica, which was formed about 2.5 billion years ago during the Neoarchean era. It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, Scotland, and Siberia, and is now roughly situated in the Arctic around the current North Pole.\nEcology.\nThe current surface expression of the Shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the bedrock, with many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe glaciation during the ice age, which covered the Shield and scraped the rock clean.\nThe lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation; it also contains many marshes and bogs (muskegs). The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen with permafrost throughout the year. Forests are not as dense in the north.\nThe Shield is covered in parts by vast boreal forests in the south that support natural ecosystems as well as a major logging industry. The boreal forest area gives way to the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador. The Midwestern Canadian Shield forests that run westwards from Northwestern Ontario have boreal forests that give way to taiga in the most northerly parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Hydrologic drainage is generally poor, the soil compacting effects of glaciation being one of the many causes. Tundra typically prevails in the northern regions. Many mammals such as caribou, white-tailed deer, moose, wolves, wolverines, weasels, mink, otters, grizzly bear, polar bears and black bears are present. In the case of polar bears (), the Shield area contains many of their denning locations, such as the Wapusk National Park.\nMining and economics.\nThe Canadian Shield is one of the world's richest areas in terms of mineral ores. It is filled with substantial deposits of nickel, gold, silver, and copper. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and one of the best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. Ejecta from the meteorite impact was found in the Rove Formation in May 2007. The nearby but less-known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. This suggests it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.\nIn northeastern Quebec, the giant Manicouagan Reservoir is the site of an extensive hydroelectric project (Manic-cinq, or Manic-5). This is one of the largest-known meteorite impact craters on Earth.\nThe Flin Flon greenstone belt in central Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan \"is one of the largest Paleoproterozoic volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) districts in the world, containing 27 copper-zinc-(gold) deposits from which more than 183 million tonnes of sulfide have been mined.\"\nThe Canadian Shield, particularly the portion in the Northwest Territories, has recently been the site of several major diamond discoveries. The kimberlite pipes in which the diamonds are found are closely associated with cratons, which provide the deep lithospheric mantle required to stabilize diamond as a mineral. The kimberlite eruptions then bring the diamonds from over depth to the surface. The Ekati and Diavik mines are actively mining kimberlite diamonds."}
{"id": "6231", "revid": "16680171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6231", "title": "Comic book", "text": "A comic book, also called comic magazine or (in the United Kingdom and Ireland) simply comic, is a publication that consists of comics art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by descriptive prose and written narrative, usually, dialogue contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan, comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \"Famous Funnies\", was released in the US in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \"comic book\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\nThe largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at (), with annual sales of 1.9billion manga books (tank\u014dbon volumes and manga magazines) in Japan, equivalent to 15issues per person. The comic book market in the United States and Canada was valued at in 2016. , the largest comic book publisher in the United States is manga distributor Viz Media, followed by DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Another major comic book market is France, where Franco-Belgian comics and Japanese manga each represent 40% of the market, followed by American comics at 10% market share.\nStructure.\nComic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a tail element. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring. There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.\nAmerican comic books.\nComics as a print medium have existed in the United States since the printing of \"The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck\" in 1842 in hardcover, making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with the first comic standard-sized comic being Funnies on Parade. Funnies on Parades was the first book that established the size, duration, and format of the modern comic book. Following this was, Dell Publishing's 36-page \"Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics\" as the first true newsstand American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\". In 1905 G.W. Dillingham Company published 24 select strips by the cartoonist Gustave Verbeek in an anthology book called 'The Incredible Upside-Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo'. The introduction of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry and ushered in the Golden Age of Comic Books. The Golden Age originated the archetype of the superhero. According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.\nHistorians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The Golden Age of Comic Books began in the 1930s, which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book as it is known today. The Silver Age of Comic Books is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the Flash in \"Showcase\" #4 (Oct. 1956). The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time Marvel Comics revolutionized the medium with such naturalistic superheroes as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four and Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the Bronze Age of Comic Books, is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s. The Modern Age of Comic Books runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.\nA notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's criticisms of the medium in his book \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954), which prompted the American Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency to investigate comic books. Wertham claimed that comic books were responsible for an increase in juvenile delinquency, as well as potential influence on a child's sexuality and morals. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the US comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America. The CMAA instilled the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA. The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.\nUnderground comic books.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as underground comics. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth counterculture and drug culture of the time. Underground comix \"reflected and commented on the social divisions and tensions of American society\". Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure \"Tijuana bibles\". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as head shops and record stores, as well as by mail order. The underground comix encouraged creators to publish their work independently so that they would have full ownership rights to their characters.\nFrank Stack's \"The Adventures of Jesus\", published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon, has been credited as the first underground comic; while R. Crumb and the crew of cartoonists who worked on \"Zap Comix\" popularized the form.\nAlternative comics.\nThe rise of comic book specialty stores in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for \"independent\" or \"alternative comics\" in the US. The first such comics included the anthology series \"Star Reach\", published by comic book writer Mike Friedrich from 1974 to 1979, and Harvey Pekar's \"American Splendor\", which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini adapted into a 2003 film. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably \"RAW\") represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of fine art.\nDuring the 1970s the \"small press\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers \u2013 such as Pacific, Eclipse, First, , and Fantagraphics \u2013 had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, detective, and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of Latin American magical realism.\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"minicomics\" form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include Avatar Comics, Hyperwerks, Raytoons, and Terminal Press, buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital print-on-demand.\nGraphic novels.\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\". Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition by Belgian Frans Masereel, American Lynd Ward and others, including Stan Lee.\nIn 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented \"picture novel\" \"It Rhymes with Lust\", a 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer \"Drake Waller\" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin, touted as \"an original full-length novel\" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist Gil Kane and collaborators devised the paperback \"comics novel\" \"Blackmark\". Will Eisner popularized the term \"graphic novel\" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work \"A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories\" in 1978.\nMarket size.\nIn 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1\u00a0billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1 percent decline, and comic book stores having a 10 percent decline over 2016.\nComic book collecting.\nThe 1970s saw the advent of specialty comic book stores. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of comic book conventions, they are now embraced by many adults.\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title. Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title. For example, Spider-Man's first appearance was in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15. New characters were often introduced this way and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the first issue of a character's own title.\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased \"Motion Picture Funnies Weekly\" #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The \"Pay Copy\" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 Heritage auction.\nThe most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over US$1\u00a0million , including two examples of \"Action Comics\" #1, the first appearance of Superman, both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and \"Detective Comics\" #27, the first appearance of Batman, via public auction.\nUpdating the above price obtained for \"Action Comics\" #1, the first appearance of Superman, the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2\u00a0million, for a 9.0 copy. \nMisprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the original press run of \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" #5, which DC executive Paul Levitz recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage Victorian era advertisement for \"Marvel Douche\", which the publisher considered offensive; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been CGC graded. (See Recalled comics for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\nIn 2000, a company named Comics Guaranty (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. Since then, other grading companies have arisen. Because condition is important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published. These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art. The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man are considered priceless.\nHistory of Race in U.S. Comic Books.\nMany early iterations of black characters in comics \"became variations on the 'single stereotypical image of Sambo'.\" Sambo was closely related to the coon stereotype but had some subtle differences. They are both a derogatory way of portraying black characters. \"The name itself, an abbreviation of raccoon, is dehumanizing. As with Sambo, the coon was portrayed as a lazy, easily frightened, chronically idle, inarticulate, buffoon.\" This portrayal \"was of course another attempt to solidify the intellectual inferiority of the black race through popular culture.\" However, in the 1940s there was a change in portrayal of black characters. \"A cursory glance...might give the impression that situations had improved for African Americans in comics.\" In many comics being produced in this time there was a major push for tolerance between races. \"These equality minded heroes began to spring to action just as African Americans were being asked to participate in the war effort.\"\nDuring this time, a government ran program, the Writers' War Board, became heavily involved in what would be published in comics. \"The Writers' War Board used comic books to shape popular perceptions of race and ethnicity...\" Not only were they using comic books as a means of recruiting all Americans, they were also using it as propaganda to, \"[construct] a justification for race based hatred of America's foreign enemies.\" The Writers' War Board created comics books that were meant to \"[promote] domestic racial harmony\". However, \"these pro-tolerance narratives struggled to overcome the popular and widely understood negative tropes used for decades in American mass culture...\" However, they weren't accomplishing this agenda within all of their comics.\nIn \"Captain Marvel Adventures,\" a character named steamboat was an amalgamation of some of the worst stereotypes of the time. The Writers' War Board did not ask for any change with this character. \"Eliminating Steamboat required the determined efforts of a black youth group in New York City.\" Originally their request was refused by individuals working on the comic stating, \"\"Captain Marvel Adventures\" included many kinds of caricatures 'for the sake of humor'.\" The black youth group responded with, \"this is not the Negro race, but your one-and-a-half millions readers will think it so.\" Afterwards, Steamboat disappeared from the comics all together. There was a comic created about the 99th squadron, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen, an all black air force unit. Instead of making the comic about their story the comic the comic was about Hop Harrigan. A white pilot who captures a Nazi, shows him videos of the 99th squadron defeating his man and then reveals to the Nazi that his men were defeated by African Americans which infuriated him as he sees them as a less superior race and can't believe they bested his men.\"...[The] Tuskegee Airmen, and images of black aviators appear in just three of the fifty three panels...[the] pilots of the 99th squadron have no dialogue and interact with neither Hop Harrigan nor his Nazi captive.\" During this time, they also used black characters in comic books as a means to invalidate the militant black groups that were fighting for equality within America. \"Spider-Man 'made it clear that militant black power was not the remedy for racial injustice'.\" \"The Falcon openly criticized black behavior stating' maybe it's important fo[sic] us to cool things down-so we can protect the rights we been fightin' for'.\" This poor portrayal and character development of black characters can be partially blamed on the fact that, during this time, \"there had rarely been a black artist or writer allowed in a major comics company\"\nAsian characters faced some of the same treatment in comics as black characters did. They were dehumanized and the narrative being pushed was that they were \"incompetent and subhuman.\" \"A 1944 issue of the \"United State Marines\" included a narrative entitled \"The Smell of the Monkeymen...the story depicts Japanese soldiers as simian brutes whose sickening body odor betrays their concealed locations.\" Chinese characters received the same treatment. \"By the time the United States entered WWII, negative perceptions of Chinese were an established part of mass culture...\" However, concerned that the Japanese could use America's anti chinese material as propaganda they began \"to present a more positive image of America's Chinese allies...\" Just as they tried to show better representation for Black people in comics they did the same for Asian people. However, \"Japanese and filipino characters [were] visually indistinguishable. Both groups have grotesque buckteeth, tattered clothing, and bright yellow skin.\" \"publishers...depicted America's Asian allies through derogatory images and language honed over the preceding decades.\" Asian characters were previously portrayed as, \"ghastly yellow demons\". During WWII, \"[every] major superhero worth his spandex devoted himself to the eradication of asian invaders.\" There was \"a constant relay race in which one asian culture merely handed off the baton of hatred to another with no perceptible changes in the manner in which the characters would be portrayed.\"\n\"The only specific depiction of a Hispanic superhero did not end well. In 1975 Marvel gave us Hector Ayala a.k.a The White Tiger.\" \"Although he fought for several years alongside the likes of much more popular heroes such as Spider-Man and Daredevil, he only lasted six years before sales of comics featuring him got so bad that Marvel had him retire. The most famous Hispanic character is Bane, a villain from Batman.\nThe Native American representation in comic books \"can be summed up in the noble savage stereotype\" \" a recurring theme...urg[ed] American indians to abandon their traditional hostility towards the United States. They were the ones painted as intolerant and disrespectful of the dominant concerns of white America\"\nEast Asian comics.\nJapanese manga.\nManga (\u6f2b\u753b) are comic books or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, though the art form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese art. The term \"manga\" is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. Outside Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country.\nD\u014djinshi.\n, fan-made Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American \"underground comics\" market; the largest d\u014djinshi fair, Comiket, attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.\nKorean manhwa.\nKorean manhwa has quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the Korean Wave. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunts the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.\nWebtoons.\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More manhwa have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.\nEuropean comics.\nFranco-Belgian comics.\n \nFrance and Belgium have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called \"BDs\" (an abbreviation of \"bande dessin\u00e9es\") in French and \"strips\" in Dutch. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics but have their own distinct style.\nThe name \"bande dessin\u00e9e\" derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as \"le neuvi\u00e8me art\" (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\nIn France, the authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\nBritish comics.\nAlthough \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\" (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. \"The Guardian\" refers to Ally Sloper as \"one of the world's first iconic cartoon characters\", and \"as famous in Victorian Britain as Dennis the Menace would be a century later.\" British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and \"Varney the Vampire\"). First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were \"Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.\"\nThe two most popular British comic books, \"The Beano\" and \"The Dandy\", were first published by DC Thomson in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million. Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in the UK during this period, Anita O'Brien, director curator at London's Cartoon Museum, states: \"When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s \u2013 and through really to the 1950s and 60s \u2013 these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.\" \"Dennis the Menace\" was created in the 1950s, which saw sales for \"The Beano\" soar. He features in the cover of \"The Beano\", with the BBC referring to him as the \"definitive naughty boy of the comic world.\"\nIn 1954, \"Tiger\" comics introduced \"Roy of the Rovers\", the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark. Other comic books such as \"Eagle\", \"Valiant\", \"Warrior\", \"Viz\" and \"2000 AD\" also flourished. Some comics, such as \"Judge Dredd\" and other \"2000 AD\" titles, have been published in a tabloid form. Underground comics and \"small press\" titles have also appeared in the UK, notably \"Oz\" and \"Escape Magazine\".\nThe content of \"Action\", another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the House of Commons. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the US, such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's Captain Marvel, and other characters such as Sheena, Mandrake the Magician, and the Phantom. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and \"Asterix\" serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books. The number of European comics available in the UK has increased in the last two decades. The British company Cinebook, founded in 2005, has released English translated versions of many European series.\nIn the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the \"British Invasion\" in comic book history. These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and \"darker and edgier\" comic books and jump start the Modern Age of Comics. Writers included Alan Moore, famous for his \"V for Vendetta\", \"From Hell\", \"Watchmen\", \"Marvelman\", and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"; Neil Gaiman with \"The Sandman\" mythos and \"Books of Magic\"; Warren Ellis, creator of \"Transmetropolitan\" and \"Planetary\"; and others such as Mark Millar, creator of \"Wanted\" and \"Kick-Ass\". The comic book series \"John Constantine, Hellblazer\", which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician John Constantine, paved the way for British writers such as Jamie Delano.\nAt Christmas, publishers repackage and commission material for comic annuals, printed and bound as hardcover A4-size books; \"Rupert\" supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. DC Thomson also repackages \"The Broons\" and \"Oor Wullie\" strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.\nOn 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the Royal Mail, released a set of stamps depicting British comic book characters and series. The collection featured \"The Beano\", \"The Dandy\", \"Eagle\", \"The Topper\", \"Roy of the Rovers\", \"Bunty\", \"Buster\", \"Valiant\", \"Twinkle\" and \"2000 AD\".\nSpanish comics.\nIt has been stated that the 13th century \"Cantigas de Santa Mar\u00eda\" could be considered as the first Spanish \"comic\", although comic books (also known in Spain as \"historietas\" or \"tebeos\") made their debut around 1857. The magazine \"TBO\" was influential in popularizing the medium. After the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime imposed strict censorship in all media: superhero comics were forbidden and as a result, comic heroes were based on historical fiction (in 1944 the medieval hero \"El Guerrero del Antifaz\" was created by Manuel Gago and another popular medieval hero, \"Capit\u00e1n Trueno\", was created in 1956 by V\u00edctor Mora and Miguel Ambrosio Zaragoza). Two publishing houses \u2014 Editorial Bruguera and Editorial Valenciana \u2014 dominated the Spanish comics market during its golden age (1950\u20131970). The most popular comics showed a recognizable style of slapstick humor (influenced by Franco-Belgian authors such as Franquin): Escobar's \"Carpanta\" and \"Zipi y Zape\", V\u00e1zquez's \"Las hermanas Gilda\" and \"Anacleto,\" Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez's \"Mortadelo y Filem\u00f3n\" and \"13. Rue del Percebe\" or Jan's \"Superl\u00f3pez\". After the end of the Francoist period, there was an increased interest in adult comics with magazines such as \"Totem\", \"El Jueves\", \"1984\", and \"El V\u00edbora,\" and works such as \"Paracuellos\" by Carlos Gim\u00e9nez.\nSpanish artists have traditionally worked in other markets finding great success, either in the American (e.g., Eisner Award winners Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, Salvador Larroca, Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez Walta, Marcos Mart\u00edn or David Aja), the British (e.g., Carlos Ezquerra, co-creator of \"Judge Dredd\") or the Franco-Belgian one (e.g., Fauve d'Or winner or \"Blacksad\" authors Juan D\u00edaz Canales and Juanjo Guarnido).\nItalian comics.\nIn Italy, comics (known in Italian as \"fumetti\") made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like Hugo Pratt and Guido Crepax exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as \"Diabolik\" or the \"Bonelli\" line\u2014namely \"Tex Willer\" or \"Dylan Dog\"\u2014remain best-sellers.\nMainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white digest size format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's \"Corto Maltese\".\nItalian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and Argentina. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of Walt Disney comic stories outside the US; Donald Duck's superhero alter ego, Paperinik, known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.\nDistribution.\nDistribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The smartphone and the tablet have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.\nDigital distribution.\nOn 13 November 2007, Marvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read many comics from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of \"Avenging Spider-Man\" #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.\nWith the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is comiXology. Some platforms, such as Graphicly, have shut down.\nComic collections in libraries.\nMany libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.\nGuinness World Records.\nOn 5 August 2018, the \"Guinness World Records\" title for the \"Largest comic book ever published\" was awarded to the Brazilian comic book \"Turma da M\u00f4nica \u2014 O Maior Gibi do Mundo!\", published by Panini Comics Brasil and Mauricio de Sousa Produ\u00e7\u00f5es. The comic book measures 69.9\u00a0cm by 99.8\u00a0cm (2\u00a0ft 3.51 in by 3\u00a0ft 3.29 in). The 18-page comic book had a print run of 120 copies.\nIn 2015, the Japanese manga creator Eiichiro Oda was awarded the \"Guinness World Records\" title for having the \"Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". His manga series \"One Piece\", which he writes and illustrates, has been serialized in the Japanese magazine \"Weekly Shonen Jump\" since December 1997, and by 2015, 77 collected volumes had been released. Guinness World Records reported in their announcement that the collected volumes of the series had sold a total of 320,866,000 units. \"One Piece\" also holds the Guinness World Records title for \"Most copies published for the same manga series\"."}
{"id": "6233", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6233", "title": "Connected space", "text": "In topology and related branches of mathematics, a connected space is a topological space that cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open subsets. Connectedness is one of the principal topological properties that are used to distinguish topological spaces.\nA subset of a topological space \"X\" is a connected set if it is a connected space when viewed as a subspace of \"X\".\nSome related but stronger conditions are path connected, simply connected, and n-connected. Another related notion is locally connected, which neither implies nor follows from connectedness.\nFormal definition.\nA topological space \"X\" is said to be disconnected if it is the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Otherwise, \"X\" is said to be connected. A subset of a topological space is said to be connected if it is connected under its subspace topology. Some authors exclude the empty set (with its unique topology) as a connected space, but this article does not follow that practice.\nFor a topological space \"X\" the following conditions are equivalent:\nHistorically this modern formulation of the notion of connectedness (in terms of no partition of \"X\" into two separated sets) first appeared (independently) with N.J. Lennes, Frigyes Riesz, and Felix Hausdorff at the beginning of the 20th century. See for details.\nConnected components.\nThe maximal connected subsets (ordered by inclusion) of a non-empty topological space are called the connected components of the space.\nThe components of any topological space \"X\" form a partition of\u00a0\"X\": they are disjoint, non-empty, and their union is the whole space.\nEvery component is a closed subset of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the rational numbers are the one-point sets (singletons), which are not open.\nLet formula_3 be the connected component of \"x\" in a topological space \"X\", and formula_4 be the intersection of all clopen sets containing \"x\" (called quasi-component of \"x\".) Then formula_5 where the equality holds if \"X\" is compact Hausdorff or locally connected.\nDisconnected spaces.\nA space in which all components are one-point sets is called totally disconnected. Related to this property, a space \"X\" is called totally separated if, for any two distinct elements \"x\" and \"y\" of \"X\", there exist disjoint open sets \"U\" containing \"x\" and \"V\" containing \"y\" such that \"X\" is the union of \"U\" and \"V\". Clearly, any totally separated space is totally disconnected, but the converse does not hold. For example take two copies of the rational numbers Q, and identify them at every point except zero. The resulting space, with the quotient topology, is totally disconnected. However, by considering the two copies of zero, one sees that the space is not totally separated. In fact, it is not even Hausdorff, and the condition of being totally separated is strictly stronger than the condition of being Hausdorff.\nExamples.\nAn example of a space that is not connected is a plane with an infinite line deleted from it. Other examples of disconnected spaces (that is, spaces which are not connected) include the plane with an annulus removed, as well as the union of two disjoint closed disks, where all examples of this paragraph bear the subspace topology induced by two-dimensional Euclidean space.\nPath connectedness.\nA path-connected space is a stronger notion of connectedness, requiring the structure of a path. A path from a point \"x\" to a point \"y\" in a topological space \"X\" is a continuous function \"\u0192\" from the unit interval [0,1] to \"X\" with \"\u0192\"(0) = \"x\" and \"\u0192\"(1) = \"y\". A path-component of \"X\" is an equivalence class of \"X\" under the equivalence relation which makes \"x\" equivalent to \"y\" if there is a path from \"x\" to \"y\". The space \"X\" is said to be path-connected (or pathwise connected or 0-connected) if there is exactly one path-component, i.e. if there is a path joining any two points in \"X\". Again, many authors exclude the empty space (note however that by this definition, the empty space is not path-connected because it has zero path-components; there is a unique equivalence relation on the empty set which has zero equivalence classes).\nEvery path-connected space is connected. The converse is not always true: examples of connected spaces that are not path-connected include the extended long line \"L\"* and the .\nSubsets of the real line R are connected if and only if they are path-connected; these subsets are the intervals of R.\nAlso, open subsets of R\"n\" or C\"n\" are connected if and only if they are path-connected.\nAdditionally, connectedness and path-connectedness are the same for finite topological spaces.\nArc connectedness.\nA space \"X\" is said to be ' or ' if any two distinct points can be joined by an ', which by definition is a path formula_23 that is also a topological embedding. Explicitly, a path formula_23 is called an ' if the surjective map formula_25 is a homeomorphism, where its image formula_26 is endowed with the subspace topology induced on it by formula_27\nEvery Hausdorff space that is path-connected is also arc-connected. An example of a space which is path-connected but not arc-connected is provided by adding a second copy formula_28 of formula_29 to the nonnegative real numbers formula_30 One endows this set with a partial order by specifying that formula_31 for any positive number formula_32 but leaving formula_29 and formula_28 incomparable. One then endows this set with the order topology. That is, one takes the open intervals formula_35 and the half-open intervals formula_36 formula_37 as a base for the topology. The resulting space is a T1 space but not a Hausdorff space. The points formula_28 and formula_29 can be connected by a path but not by an arc in this space.\nLocal connectedness.\nA topological space is said to be locally connected at a point \"x\" if every neighbourhood of \"x\" contains a connected open neighbourhood. It is locally connected if it has a base of connected sets. It can be shown that a space \"X\" is locally connected if and only if every component of every open set of \"X\" is open.\nSimilarly, a topological space is said to be if it has a base of path-connected sets.\nAn open subset of a locally path-connected space is connected if and only if it is path-connected.\nThis generalizes the earlier statement about R\"n\" and C\"n\", each of which is locally path-connected. More generally, any topological manifold is locally path-connected.\nLocally connected does not imply connected, nor does locally path-connected imply path connected. A simple example of a locally connected (and locally path-connected) space that is not connected (or path-connected) is the union of two separated intervals in formula_18, such as formula_41.\nA classical example of a connected space that is not locally connected is the so called topologist's sine curve, defined as formula_42, with the Euclidean topology induced by inclusion in formula_43.\nSet operations.\nThe intersection of connected sets is not necessarily connected.\nThe union of connected sets is not necessarily connected, as can be seen by considering formula_44.\nEach ellipse is a connected set, but the union is not connected, since it can be partitioned to two disjoint open sets formula_45 and formula_46.\nThis means that, if the union formula_47 is disconnected, then the collection formula_48 can be partitioned to two sub-collections, such that the unions of the sub-collections are disjoint and open in formula_47 (see picture). This implies that in several cases, a union of connected sets necessarily connected. In particular:\nThe set difference of connected sets is not necessarily connected. However, if formula_57 and their difference formula_58 is disconnected (and thus can be written as a union of two open sets formula_59 and formula_60), then the union of formula_61 with each such component is connected (i.e. formula_62 is connected for all formula_63).\nBy contradiction, suppose formula_64 is not connected. So it can be written as the union of two disjoint open sets, e.g. formula_65. Because formula_61 is connected, it must be entirely contained in one of these components, say formula_67, and thus formula_68 is contained in formula_59. Now we know that:\nThe two sets in the last union are disjoint and open in formula_47, so there is a separation of formula_47, contradicting the fact that formula_47 is connected.\nGraphs.\nGraphs have path connected subsets, namely those subsets for which every pair of points has a path of edges joining them.\nBut it is not always possible to find a topology on the set of points which induces the same connected sets. The 5-cycle graph (and any \"n\"-cycle with \"n\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a03 odd) is one such example.\nAs a consequence, a notion of connectedness can be formulated independently of the topology on a space. To wit, there is a category of connective spaces consisting of sets with collections of connected subsets satisfying connectivity axioms; their morphisms are those functions which map connected sets to connected sets . Topological spaces and graphs are special cases of connective spaces; indeed, the finite connective spaces are precisely the finite graphs.\nHowever, every graph can be canonically made into a topological space, by treating vertices as points and edges as copies of the unit interval (see topological graph theory#Graphs as topological spaces). Then one can show that the graph is connected (in the graph theoretical sense) if and only if it is connected as a topological space.\nStronger forms of connectedness.\nThere are stronger forms of connectedness for topological spaces, for instance: \nIn general, note that any path connected space must be connected but there exist connected spaces that are not path connected. The deleted comb space furnishes such an example, as does the above-mentioned topologist's sine curve."}
{"id": "6235", "revid": "2039422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6235", "title": "Cell nucleus", "text": "In cell biology, the nucleus (pl. nuclei; from Latin or , meaning \"kernel\" or \"seed\") is a membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others including osteoclasts have many. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm; and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton supports the cell as a whole.\nThe cell nucleus contains all of the cell's genome, except for the small amount of mitochondrial DNA and, in plant cells, plastid DNA. Nuclear DNA is organized as multiple long linear molecules in a complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are structured in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression\u2014the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell.\nBecause the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pores are required to regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes.\nAlthough the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate messenger RNA.\nStructures.\nThe nucleus contains nearly all of the cell's DNA, surrounded by a network of fibrous intermediate filaments and enveloped in a double membrane called the \"nuclear envelope\". The nuclear envelope separates the fluid inside the nucleus, called the nucleoplasm, from the rest of the cell. The size of the nucleus depends on the size of the cell it is contained in, with a nucleus typically occupying about 8% of the total cell volume. \nThe nucleus is the largest organelle in animal cells. In mammalian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres (\u00b5m). \nNuclear envelope and pores.\nThe nuclear envelope consists of two membranes, an inner and an outer nuclear membrane. Together, these membranes serve to separate the cell's genetic material from the rest of the cell contents, and allow the nucleus to maintain an environment distinct from the rest of the cell. Despite their close apposition around much of the nucleus, the two membranes differ substantially in shape and contents. The inner membrane surrounds the nuclear content, providing its defining edge. Embedded within the inner membrane, various proteins bind the intermediate filaments that give the nucleus its structure. The outer membrane encloses the inner membrane, and is continuous with the adjacent endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As part of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the outer nuclear membrane is studded with ribosomes that are actively translating proteins across membrane. The space between the two membranes, called the \"perinuclear space\", is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.\nNuclear pores, which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 60\u201380 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The pores are 100\u00a0nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9\u00a0nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the \"nuclear basket\" that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.\nMost proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some RNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; in the absence of a ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.\nNuclear lamina.\nIn animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.\nThe nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the \"nucleoplasmic veil\", that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures that make up the veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.\nLike the components of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a \"protofilament\". Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike \"filament\". These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.\nMutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as \"laminopathies\". The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.\nChromosomes.\nThe cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.\nThere are two types of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into \"facultative\" heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and \"constitutive\" heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called \"chromosome territories\". Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.\nAntibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, in particular, nucleosomes, have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction.\nNucleolus.\nThe nucleolus is the largest of the discrete densely stained, membraneless structures known as nuclear bodies found in the nucleus. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.\nIn the first step of ribosome assembly, a protein called RNA polymerase I transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into two large rRNA subunits \u2013 5.8S, and 28S, and a small rRNA subunit 18S. The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) molecules, some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger RNAs encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.\nWhen observed under the electron microscope, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost \"fibrillar centers\" (FCs), surrounded by the \"dense fibrillar component\" (DFC) (that contains fibrillarin and nucleolin), which in turn is bordered by the \"granular component\" (GC) (that contains the protein nucleophosmin). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.\nOther nuclear bodies.\nBesides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other nuclear bodies. These include Cajal bodies, gemini of Cajal bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.\nOther subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.\nCajal bodies and gems.\nA nucleus typically contains between one and ten compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2\u00a0\u00b5m and 2.0\u00a0\u00b5m depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.\nSimilar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of Cajal bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation in reference to their close \"twin\" relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), but do contain a protein called survival of motor neuron (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure. Later ultrastructural studies have shown gems to be twins of Cajal bodies with the difference being in the coilin component; Cajal bodies are SMN positive and coilin positive, and gems are SMN positive and coilin negative.\nPIKA and PTF domains.\nPIKA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).\nPML bodies.\nPromyelocytic leukemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1\u20131.0\u00a0\u00b5m. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. Pml-/- mice, which are unable to create PML bodies, develop normally without obvious ill effects, showing that PML bodies are not required for most essential biological processes.\nSplicing speckles.\nSpeckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells. At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery splicing snRNPs and other splicing proteins necessary for pre-mRNA processing. Because of a cell's changing requirements, the composition and location of these bodies changes according to mRNA transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins. The splicing speckles are also known as nuclear speckles (nuclear specks), splicing factor compartments (SF compartments), interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), and B snurposomes.\nB snurposomes are found in the amphibian oocyte nuclei and in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" embryos. B snurposomes appear alone or attached to the Cajal bodies in the electron micrographs of the amphibian nuclei. IGCs function as storage sites for the splicing factors.\nParaspeckles.\nDiscovered by Fox et al. in 2002, paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments in the interchromatin space of the nucleus. First documented in HeLa cells, where there are generally 10\u201330 per nucleus, paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines, and tissue sections. Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the \"para\" is short for parallel and the \"speckles\" refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity.\nParaspeckles sequester nuclear proteins and RNA and thus appear to function as a molecular sponge that is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI(m)68, and PSF) form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.\nPerichromatin fibrils.\nPerichromatin fibrils are visible only under electron microscope. They are located next to the transcriptionally active chromatin and are hypothesized to be the sites of active pre-mRNA processing.\nClastosomes.\nClastosomes are small nuclear bodies (0.2\u20130.5\u00a0\u00b5m) described as having a thick ring-shape due to the peripheral capsule around these bodies. This name is derived from the Greek \"klastos\", broken and \"soma\", body. Clastosomes are not typically present in normal cells, making them hard to detect. They form under high proteolytic conditions within the nucleus and degrade once there is a decrease in activity or if cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors. The scarcity of clastosomes in cells indicates that they are not required for proteasome function. Osmotic stress has also been shown to cause the formation of clastosomes. These nuclear bodies contain catalytic and regulatory subunits of the proteasome and its substrates, indicating that clastosomes are sites for degrading proteins.\nFunction.\nThe nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes. The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle.\nThe nucleus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane, it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as DNA molecules, along with a variety of proteins, to form chromosomes.\nCell compartmentalization.\nThe nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.\nIn order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF-\u03baB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-\u03b1, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-\u03baB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.\nThe compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.\nReplication.\nThe main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle. It has been found that replication happens in a localised way in the cell nucleus. In the S phase of interphase of the cell cycle; replication takes place. Contrary to the traditional view of moving replication forks along stagnant DNA, a concept of \"replication factories\" emerged, which means replication forks are concentrated towards some immobilised 'factory' regions through which the template DNA strands pass like conveyor belts.\nGene expression.\nGene expression first involves transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.\nSince the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.\nProcessing of pre-mRNA.\nNewly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.\nRNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.\nDynamics and regulation.\nNuclear transport.\nThe entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. \"Cargo\" proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran, which is bound to either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.\nNuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.\nSpecialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role in protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.\nAssembly and disassembly.\nDuring its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus\u00a0\u2014 the envelope and lamina\u00a0\u2014 can be systematically degraded.\nIn most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.\nAt a certain point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.\nHowever, in dinoflagellates, the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.\nApoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.\nThe nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.\nDisease-related dynamics.\nInitially, it has been suspected that immunoglobulins in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. lupus erythematosus) IgG can enter the nucleus.\nNuclei per cell.\nMost eukaryotic cell types usually have a single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division.\nAnucleated cells.\nAn anucleated cell contains no nucleus and is, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria, and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte. The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature \"micronucleated\" erythrocytes into the bloodstream. Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.\nIn flowering plants, this condition occurs in sieve tube elements.\nMultinucleated cells.\nMultinucleated cells contain multiple nuclei. Most acantharean species of protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other examples include the intestinal parasites in the genus \"Giardia\", which have two nuclei per cell. Ciliates have two kinds of nuclei in a single cell, a somatic macronucleus and a germline micronucleus. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery of the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Other multinucleate cells in the human are osteoclasts a type of bone cell. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.\nA number of dinoflagellates are known to have two nuclei. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic diatom.\nEvolution.\nAs the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.\nThe first model known as the \"syntrophic model\" proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domain have no cell nucleus.) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria. The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.\nA second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures. A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the chronocyte, evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell.\nThe most controversial model, known as \"viral eukaryogenesis\", posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing histones to viral envelopes). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular \"predator\". Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.\nA more recent proposal, the \"exomembrane hypothesis\", suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.\nHistory.\nThe nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632\u20131723). He observed a \"lumen\", the nucleus, in the red blood cells of salmon. Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei.\nThe nucleus was also described by Franz Bauer in 1804 and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in a talk at the Linnean Society of London. Brown was studying orchids under the microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the \"areola\" or \"nucleus\", in the cells of the flower's outer layer. He did not suggest a potential function. \nIn 1838, Matthias Schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name \"cytoblast\" (\"cell builder\"). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around \"cytoblasts\". Franz Meyen was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the \"cytoblast\" or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak (1852) and Rudolf Virchow (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells (\"\"). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.\nBetween 1877 and 1878, Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a \"monerula\", a structureless mass of primordial protoplasm (\"Urschleim\"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including amphibians and molluscs. Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ \"cells\" for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed."}

{"id": "6237", "revid": "40226464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6237", "title": "Christmas", "text": "Christmas (or the Feast of the Nativity) is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration by billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season centered around it.\nThe traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the information.\nAlthough the month and date of Jesus' birth are unknown, the church in the early fourth century fixed the date as December 25. This corresponds to the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.\nThe celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; church services; a special meal; and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.\nEtymology.\n\"Christmas\" is a shortened form of \"Christ's mass\". The word is recorded as \"Cr\u012bstesm\u00e6sse\" in 1038 and \"Cristes-messe\" in 1131. \"Cr\u012bst\" (genitive \"Cr\u012bstes\") is from Greek \"Khr\u012bstos\" (\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), a translation of Hebrew \"M\u0101\u0161\u00eea\u1e25\" (\u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7), \"Messiah\", meaning \"anointed\"; and \"m\u00e6sse\" is from Latin \"missa\", the celebration of the Eucharist.\nThe form \"Christenmas\" was also historically used, but is now considered archaic and dialectal. The term derives from Middle English \"Cristenmasse\", meaning \"Christian mass\". \"Xmas\" is an abbreviation of \"Christmas\" found particularly in print, based on the initial letter chi (\u03a7) in Greek \"Khr\u012bstos\" (\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), \"Christ\", though numerous style guides discourage its use. This abbreviation has precedent in Middle English \"\u03a7\u03c1\u0304es masse\" (where \"\u03a7\u03c1\u0304\" is an abbreviation for \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2).\nOther names.\nIn addition to \"Christmas\", the holiday has been known by various other names throughout its history. The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as \"midwinter\", or, more rarely, as \"N\u0101tiuite\u00f0\" (from Latin \"n\u0101t\u012bvit\u0101s\" below). \"Nativity\", meaning \"birth\", is from Latin \"n\u0101t\u012bvit\u0101s\". In Old English, \"G\u0113ola\" (\"Yule\") referred to the period corresponding to December and January, which was eventually equated with Christian Christmas. \"Noel\" (or \"Nowel\") entered English in the late 14th century and is from the Old French \"no\u00ebl\" or \"na\u00ebl\", itself ultimately from the Latin \"n\u0101t\u0101lis (di\u0113s)\" meaning \"birth (day)\".\nNativity.\nThe gospels of Luke and Matthew describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary. In Luke, Joseph and Mary travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem for the census, and Jesus is born there and laid in a manger. Angels proclaimed him a savior for all people, and shepherds came to adore him.\nMatthew adds that the magi follow a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the king of the Jews. King Herod orders the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlehem, but the family flees to Egypt and later returns to Nazareth.\nHistory.\nThe nativity sequences included in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke prompted early Christian writers to suggest various dates for the anniversary. Although no date is indicated in the gospels, early Christians connected Jesus to the Sun through the use of such phrases as \"Sun of righteousness.\" The Romans marked the winter solstice on December 25. The first recorded Christmas celebration was in Rome on December 25, AD 336. In the 3rd century, the date of the nativity was the subject of great interest. Around AD 200, Clement of Alexandria wrote:\n Various factors contributed to the selection of December 25 as a date of celebration: it was the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar and it was nine months after March 25, the date of the vernal equinox and a date linked to the conception of Jesus (celebrated as the Feast of the Annunciation).\nChristmas played a role in the Arian controversy of the fourth century. After this controversy ran its course, the prominence of the holiday declined for a few centuries. The feast regained prominence after 800 when Charlemagne was crowned emperor on Christmas Day.\nIn Puritan England, Christmas was banned as it was associated with drunkenness and other misbehaviour. It was restored as a legal holiday in England in 1660, but remained disreputable in the minds of many people. In the early 19th century, Christmas festivities and services became widespread with the rise of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England that emphasized the centrality of Christmas in Christianity and charity to the poor, along with Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, and other authors emphasizing family, children, kind-heartedness, gift-giving, and Santa Claus (for Irving), or Father Christmas (for Dickens).\nIntroduction of the festival.\nChristmas does not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and Tertullian. Origen and Arnobius both fault the pagans for celebrating birthdays, which suggests that Christmas was not celebrated in their time. Arnobius wrote after AD 297. The Chronograph of 354 records that a Christmas celebration took place in Rome in 336, eight days before the calends of January.\nIn the East, the birth of Jesus was celebrated in connection with the Epiphany on January 6. This holiday was not primarily about the nativity, but rather the baptism of Jesus. Christmas was promoted in the East as part of the revival of Orthodox Christianity that followed the death of the pro-Arian Emperor Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. The feast was introduced in Constantinople in 379, in Antioch by John Chrysostom towards the end of the fourth century, probably in 388, and in Alexandria in the following century.\nSolstice date.\nSome scholars hold that December 25 was the date of the winter solstice in the Roman calendar. Another scholar writes that \"the cult of the Sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect\". A late fourth-century sermon by Saint Augustine explains why this was a fitting day to celebrate Christ's nativity: \"Hence it is that He was born on the day which is the shortest in our earthly reckoning and from which subsequent days begin to increase in length. He, therefore, who bent low and lifted us up chose the shortest day, yet the one whence light begins to increase.\"\nLinking Jesus to the Sun was supported by various Biblical passages. Jesus was considered to be the \"Sun of righteousness\" prophesied by Malachi: \"Unto you shall the sun of righteousness arise, and healing is in his wings.\"\nSuch solar symbolism could support more than one date of birth. An anonymous work known as \"De Pascha Computus\" (243) linked the idea that creation began at the spring equinox, on March 25, with the conception or birth (the word \"nascor\" can mean either) of Jesus on March 28, the day of the creation of the sun in the Genesis account. One translation reads: \"O the splendid and divine providence of the Lord, that on that day, the very day, on which the sun was made, March 28, a Wednesday, Christ should be born.\nIn the 17th century, Isaac Newton, who, coincidentally, was born on December 25, argued that the date of Christmas may have been selected to correspond with the solstice.\nConversely, according to Steven Hijmans of the University of Alberta, \"It is cosmic symbolism ... which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the southern solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the northern solstice as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception.\"\nTalmudic hypothesis.\nAn Aggadic legend from tractate Avodah Zarah 8a contains contemporary observations regarding the Roman sun-cult holidays, and a theory of pre-historic origin of winter solstice festival.\nMishna Avodah Zarah 8a.5: And these are the festivals of the slaves of the stars: Kalenda, Saturnalia, and Kratesis, and the day of the festival of their kings, and the birthday of the king, and the anniversary of the day of the death of the king.\nGemara 8a.6: Rav \u1e24anan bar Rava says: When are these festivals celebrated? Kalenda is celebrated during the eight days after the winter solstice, and Saturnalia is celebrated during the eight days before the winter solstice.\nGemara 8a.7: With regard to the dates of these festivals, the Sages taught: When Adam the first man saw that the day was progressively diminishing, as the days become shorter from the autumnal equinox until the winter solstice, he did not yet know that this is a normal phenomenon, and therefore he said: Woe is me; perhaps because I sinned the world is becoming dark around me and will ultimately return to the primordial state of chaos and disorder. And this is the death that was sentenced upon me from Heaven, as it is written: \u201cAnd to dust shall you return\u201d (Genesis 3:19). He arose and spent eight days in fasting and in prayer.\nGemara 8a.8: Once he saw that the season of Tevet, i.e., the winter solstice, had arrived, and saw that the day was progressively lengthening after the solstice, he said: Clearly, the days become shorter and then longer, and this is the order of the world. He went and observed a festival for eight days. Upon the next year, he observed both these eight days on which he had fasted on the previous year, and these eight days of his celebration, as days of festivities. He, Adam, established these festivals for the sake of Heaven, but they, the gentiles of later generations, established them for the sake of idol worship.\nCalculation hypothesis.\nThe calculation hypothesis suggests that an earlier holiday held on March 25 became associated with the Incarnation. Christmas was then calculated as nine months later. The calculation hypothesis was proposed by French writer Louis Duchesne in 1889. In modern times, March 25 is celebrated as Annunciation. This holiday was created in the seventh century and was assigned to a date that is nine months before Christmas, in addition to being the traditional date of the equinox. It is unrelated to the Quartodeciman, which had been forgotten by this time. Forgotten by everyone except the Jews, of course, who continued to observe Passover; also a Quartodeciman feast.\nEarly Christians celebrated the life of Jesus on a date considered equivalent to 14 Nisan (Passover) on the local calendar. Because Passover was held on the 14th of the month, this feast is referred to as the Quartodeciman. All the major events of Christ's life, especially the passion, were celebrated on this date. In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul mentions Passover, presumably celebrated according to the local calendar in Corinth. Tertullian (d. 220), who lived in Latin-speaking North Africa, gives the date of passion celebration as March 25. The date of the passion was moved to Good Friday in 165 when Pope Soter created Easter by reassigning the Resurrection to a Sunday. According to the calculation hypothesis, the celebration of the Quartodeciman continued in some areas and the feast became associated with Incarnation.\nThe calculation hypothesis is considered academically to be \"a thoroughly viable hypothesis\", though not certain. It was a traditional Jewish belief that great men were born and died on the same day, so lived a whole number of years, without fractions: Jesus was therefore considered to have been conceived on March 25, as he died on March 25, which was calculated to have coincided with 14\u00a0Nisan. A passage in \"Commentary on the Prophet Daniel\" (204) by Hippolytus of Rome identifies December 25 as the date of the nativity. This passage is generally considered a late interpellation. But the manuscript includes another passage, one that is more likely to be authentic, that gives the passion as March 25.\nIn 221, Sextus Julius Africanus (c.\u00a0160 \u2013 c.\u00a0240) gave March 25 as the day of creation and of the conception of Jesus in his universal history. This conclusion was based on solar symbolism, with March 25 the date of the equinox. As this implies a birth in December, it is sometimes claimed to be the earliest identification of December 25 as the nativity. However, Africanus was not such an influential writer that it is likely he determined the date of Christmas.\nThe tractate \"De solstitia et aequinoctia conceptionis et nativitatis Domini nostri Iesu Christi et Iohannis Baptistae,\" falsely attributed to John Chrysostom, also argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as March 25. This anonymous tract also states: \"But Our Lord, too, is born in the month of December\u00a0... the eight before the calends of January [25 December]\u00a0..., But they call it the 'Birthday of the Unconquered'. Who indeed is so unconquered as Our Lord...? Or, if they say that it is the birthday of the Sun, He is the Sun of Justice.\"\nHistory of religions hypothesis.\nThe rival \"History of Religions\" hypothesis suggests that the Church selected December 25 date to appropriate festivities held by the Romans in honor of the Sun god Sol Invictus. This cult was established by Aurelian in 274. An explicit expression of this theory appears in an annotation of uncertain date added to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century Syrian bishop Jacob Bar-Salibi. The scribe who added it wrote:\nIn 1743, German Protestant Paul Ernst Jablonski argued Christmas was placed on December 25 to correspond with the Roman solar holiday \"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\" and was therefore a \"paganization\" that debased the true church. However, it has been also argued that, on the contrary, the Emperor Aurelian, who in 274 instituted the holiday of the \"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\", did so partly as an attempt to give a pagan significance to a date already important for Christians in Rome.\nHermann Usener and others proposed that the Christians chose this day because it was the Roman feast celebrating the birthday of Sol Invictus. Modern scholar S. E. Hijmans, however, states that \"While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas.\" Moreover, Thomas J. Talley holds that the Roman Emperor Aurelian placed a festival of Sol Invictus on December 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the Christian Church, which had already been celebrating Christmas on that date first. In the judgement of the Church of England Liturgical Commission, the History of Religions hypothesis has been challenged by a view based on an old tradition, according to which the date of Christmas was fixed at nine months after March 25, the date of the vernal equinox, on which the Annunciation was celebrated.\nWith regard to a December religious feast of the deified Sun (Sol), as distinct from a solstice feast of the birth (or rebirth) of the astronomical sun, Hijmans has commented that \"while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas\". \"Thomas Talley has shown that, although the Emperor Aurelian's dedication of a temple to the sun god in the Campus Martius (C.E. 274) probably took place on the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' on December 25, the cult of the sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect.\" The \"Oxford Companion to Christian Thought\" remarks on the uncertainty about the order of precedence between the religious celebrations of the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun and of the birthday of Jesus, stating that the hypothesis that December 25 was chosen for celebrating the birth of Jesus on the basis of the belief that his conception occurred on March 25 \"potentially establishes 25 December as a Christian festival before Aurelian's decree, which, when promulgated, might have provided for the Christian feast both opportunity and challenge\".\nRelation to concurrent celebrations.\nMany popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus' birth, with some claiming that certain elements have origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated by pagan populations who were later converted to Christianity. The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday's inception, ranging from a sometimes raucous, drunken, carnival-like state in the Middle Ages, to a tamer family-oriented and children-centered theme introduced in a 19th-century transformation. The celebration of Christmas was banned on more than one occasion within certain groups, such as the Puritans and Jehovah's Witnesses (who do not celebrate birthdays in general), due to concerns that it was too unbiblical.\nPrior to and through the early Christian centuries, winter festivals were the most popular of the year in many European pagan cultures. Reasons included the fact that less agricultural work needed to be done during the winter, as well as an expectation of better weather as spring approached. Celtic winter herbs such as mistletoe and ivy, and the custom of kissing under a mistletoe, are common in modern Christmas celebrations in the English-speaking countries.\nThe pre-Christian Germanic peoples\u2014including the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse\u2014celebrated a winter festival called Yule, held in the late December to early January period, yielding modern English \"yule\", today used as a synonym for \"Christmas\". In Germanic language-speaking areas, numerous elements of modern Christmas folk custom and iconography may have originated from Yule, including the Yule log, Yule boar, and the Yule goat. Often leading a ghostly procession through the sky (the Wild Hunt), the long-bearded god Odin is referred to as \"the Yule one\" and \"Yule father\" in Old Norse texts, while other gods are referred to as \"Yule beings\". On the other hand, as there are no reliable existing references to a Christmas log prior to the 16th century, the burning of the Christmas block may have been an early modern invention by Christians unrelated to the pagan practice.\nIn eastern Europe also, old pagan traditions were incorporated into Christmas celebrations, an example being the Koleda, which was incorporated into the Christmas carol.\nPost-classical history.\nIn the Early Middle Ages, Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in western Christianity focused on the visit of the magi. But the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the \"forty days of St. Martin\" (which began on November 11, the feast of St. Martin of Tours), now known as Advent. In Italy, former Saturnalian traditions were attached to Advent. Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the Twelve Days of Christmas (December 25 \u2013 January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or Twelve Holy Days.\nThe prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after Charlemagne was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King Edmund the Martyr was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King William I of England was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.\nBy the High Middle Ages, the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various magnates celebrated Christmas. King Richard II of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten. The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. Caroling also became popular, and was originally performed by a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form. \"Misrule\"\u2014drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling\u2014was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on New Year's Day, and there was special Christmas ale.\nChristmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated ivy, holly, and other evergreens. Christmas gift-giving during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal relationships, such as tenant and landlord. The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing, sporting, and card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season featured lavish dinners, elaborate masques, and pageants. In 1607, King James I insisted that a play be acted on Christmas night and that the court indulge in games. It was during the Reformation in 16th\u201317th-century Europe that many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or \"Christkindl\", and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.\nModern history.\nAssociating it with drunkenness and other misbehaviour, the Puritans banned Christmas in England in the 17th century. It was restored as a legal holiday in 1660, but remained disreputable. In the early 19th century, the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church ushered in \"the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival\" as well as \"special charities for the poor\" in addition to \"special services and musical events\". Charles Dickens and other writers helped in this revival of the holiday by \"changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated\" as they emphasized family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the historic revelry common in some places.\n18th century.\nFollowing the Protestant Reformation, many of the new denominations, including the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church, continued to celebrate Christmas. In 1629, the Anglican poet John Milton penned \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", a poem that has since been read by many during Christmastide. Donald Heinz, a professor at California State University, states that Martin Luther \"inaugurated a period in which Germany would produce a unique culture of Christmas, much copied in North America.\" Among the congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church, Christmas was celebrated as one of the principal evangelical feasts.\nHowever, in 17th century England, some groups such as the Puritans, strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the \"trappings of popery\" or the \"rags of the Beast\". In contrast, the established Anglican Church \"pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts, penitential seasons, and saints' days. The calendar reform became a major point of tension between the Anglican party and the Puritan party.\" The Catholic Church also responded, promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form. King Charles I of England directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old-style Christmas generosity. Following the Parliamentarian victory over Charles I during the English Civil War, England's Puritan rulers banned Christmas in 1647.\nProtests followed as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks Canterbury was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans. The book, \"The Vindication of Christmas\" (London, 1652), argued against the Puritans, and makes note of Old English Christmas traditions, dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with \"plow-boys\" and \"maidservants\", old Father Christmas and carol singing.\nThe Restoration of King Charles II in 1660 ended the ban, but many Calvinist clergymen still disapproved of Christmas celebration. As such, in Scotland, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland discouraged the observance of Christmas, and though James VI commanded its celebration in 1618, attendance at church was scant. The Parliament of Scotland officially abolished the observance of Christmas in 1640, claiming that the church had been \"purged of all superstitious observation of days\". It was not until 1958 that Christmas again became a Scottish public holiday.\nFollowing the Restoration of Charles II, \"Poor Robin's Almanack\" contained the lines: \"Now thanks to God for Charles return, / Whose absence made old Christmas mourn. / For then we scarcely did it know, / Whether it Christmas were or no.\" The diary of James Woodforde, from the latter half of the 18th century, details the observance of Christmas and celebrations associated with the season over a number of years.\nIn Colonial America, the Pilgrims of New England shared radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. The Plymouth Pilgrims put their loathing for the day into practice in 1620 when they spent their first Christmas Day in the New World working \u2013 thus demonstrating their complete contempt for the day. Non-Puritans in New England deplored the loss of the holidays enjoyed by the laboring classes in England. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban by the Puritans was revoked in 1681 by English governor Edmund Andros, however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.\nAt the same time, Christian residents of Virginia and New York observed the holiday freely. Pennsylvania German Settlers, pre-eminently the Moravian settlers of Bethlehem, Nazareth and Lititz in Pennsylvania and the Wachovia Settlements in North Carolina, were enthusiastic celebrators of Christmas. The Moravians in Bethlehem had the first Christmas trees in America as well as the first Nativity Scenes. Christmas fell out of favor in the United States after the American Revolution, when it was considered an English custom.\nGeorge Washington attacked Hessian (German) mercenaries on the day after Christmas during the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776, Christmas being much more popular in Germany than in America at this time.\nWith the atheistic Cult of Reason in power during the era of Revolutionary France, Christian Christmas religious services were banned and the three kings cake was renamed the \"equality cake\" under anticlerical government policies.\n19th century.\nIn the UK, Christmas Day became a bank holiday in 1834. Boxing Day, the day after Christmas, was added in 1871.\nIn the early-19th century, writers imagined Tudor Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration. In 1843, Charles Dickens wrote the novel \"A Christmas Carol\", which helped revive the \"spirit\" of Christmas and seasonal merriment. Its instant popularity played a major role in portraying Christmas as a holiday emphasizing family, goodwill, and compassion.\nDickens sought to construct Christmas as a family-centered festival of generosity, linking \"worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation.\" Superimposing his humanitarian vision of the holiday, in what has been termed \"Carol Philosophy\", Dickens influenced many aspects of Christmas that are celebrated today in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games, and a festive generosity of spirit. A prominent phrase from the tale, \"Merry Christmas\", was popularized following the appearance of the story. This coincided with the appearance of the Oxford Movement and the growth of Anglo-Catholicism, which led a revival in traditional rituals and religious observances.\nThe term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, with \"Bah! Humbug!\" dismissive of the festive spirit. In 1843, the first commercial Christmas card was produced by Sir Henry Cole. The revival of the Christmas Carol began with William Sandys's \"Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern\" (1833), with the first appearance in print of \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\", \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" and \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\", popularized in Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\".\nIn Britain, the Christmas tree was introduced in the early 19th century following the personal union with the Kingdom of Hanover by Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III. In 1832, the future Queen Victoria wrote about her delight at having a Christmas tree, hung with lights, ornaments, and presents placed round it. After her marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the custom became more widespread throughout Britain.\nAn image of the British royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle created a sensation when it was published in the \"Illustrated London News\" in 1848. A modified version of this image was published in \"Godey's Lady's Book\", Philadelphia in 1850. By the 1870s, putting up a Christmas tree had become common in America.\nIn America, interest in Christmas had been revived in the 1820s by several short stories by Washington Irving which appear in his \"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\" and \"Old Christmas\". Irving's stories depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in Aston Hall, Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned, and he used the tract \"Vindication of Christmas\" (1652) of Old English Christmas traditions, that he had transcribed into his journal as a format for his stories.\nIn 1822, Clement Clarke Moore wrote the poem \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\" (popularly known by its first line: \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\").\nThe poem helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal Christmas shopping began to assume economic importance.\nThis also started the cultural conflict between the holiday's spiritual significance and its associated commercialism that some see as corrupting the holiday. In her 1850 book \"The First Christmas in New England\", Harriet Beecher Stowe includes a character who complains that the true meaning of Christmas was lost in a shopping spree.\nWhile the celebration of Christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the U.S., Henry Wadsworth Longfellow detected \"a transition state about Christmas here in New England\" in 1856. \"The old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday; though every year makes it more so.\"\nIn Reading, Pennsylvania, a newspaper remarked in 1861, \"Even our presbyterian friends who have hitherto steadfastly ignored Christmas\u2014threw open their church doors and assembled in force to celebrate the anniversary of the Savior's birth.\"\nThe First Congregational Church of Rockford, Illinois, \"although of genuine Puritan stock\", was 'preparing for a grand Christmas jubilee', a news correspondent reported in 1864. By 1860, fourteen states including several from New England had adopted Christmas as a legal holiday. In 1875, Louis Prang introduced the Christmas card to Americans. He has been called the \"father of the American Christmas card\". On June 28, 1870, Christmas was formally declared a United States federal holiday.\n20th century.\nUp to the 1950s in the UK, many Christmas customs were restricted to the upper classes and better-off families. The mass of the population had not adopted many of the Christmas rituals that later became general. The Christmas tree was rare. Christmas dinner might be beef or goose \u2013 certainly not turkey. In their stockings children might get an apple, orange, and sweets. Full celebration of a family Christmas with all the trimmings only became widespread with increased prosperity from the 1950s. National papers were published on Christmas Day until 1912. Post was still delivered on Christmas Day until 1961. League football matches continued in Scotland until the 1970s while in England they ceased at the end of the 1950s.\nUnder the state atheism of the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations\u2014along with other Christian holidays\u2014were prohibited in public. During the 1920s, '30s, and '40s, the League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, such as the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including Easter; the League established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement. At the height of this persecution, in 1929, on Christmas Day, children in Moscow were encouraged to spit on crucifixes as a protest against the holiday. It was not until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the persecution ended and Orthodox Christmas became a state holiday again for the first time in Russia after seven decades.\nEuropean History Professor Joseph Perry wrote that likewise, in Nazi Germany, \"because Nazi ideologues saw organized religion as an enemy of the totalitarian state, propagandists sought to deemphasize\u2014or eliminate altogether\u2014the Christian aspects of the holiday\" and that \"Propagandists tirelessly promoted numerous Nazified Christmas songs, which replaced Christian themes with the regime's racial ideologies.\"\nAs Christmas celebrations began to be held around the world even outside traditional Christian cultures in the 20th century, some Muslim-majority countries subsequently banned the practice of Christmas, claiming it undermines Islam.\nObservance and traditions.\nChristmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and public holiday in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. Hong Kong); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.\nAmong countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures.\nChurch attendance.\nChristmas Day (inclusive of its vigil, Christmas Eve), is a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, a holy day of obligation in the Roman Catholic Church, and a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion. Other Christian denominations do not rank their feast days but nevertheless place importance on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, as with other Christian feasts like Easter, Ascension Day, and Pentecost. As such, for Christians, attending a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day church service plays an important part in the recognition of the Christmas season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. A 2010 survey by LifeWay Christian Resources found that six in ten Americans attend church services during this time. In the United Kingdom, the Church of England reported an estimated attendance of people at Christmas services in 2015.\nDecorations.\nNativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They were popularised by Saint Francis of Assisi from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe. Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources, and can vary from simple representations of the crib to far more elaborate sets \u2013 renowned manger scene traditions include the colourful \"Krak\u00f3w szopka\" in Poland, which imitate Krak\u00f3w's historical buildings as settings, the elaborate Italian \"presepi\" (, and ), or the Proven\u00e7al cr\u00e8ches in southern France, using hand-painted terracotta figurines called \"santons\". In certain parts of the world, notably Sicily, living nativity scenes following the tradition of Saint Francis are a popular alternative to static cr\u00e8ches. The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children. In countries where a representation of the Nativity scene is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family heirloom.\nThe traditional colors of Christmas decorations are red, green, and gold. Red symbolizes the blood of Jesus, which was shed in his crucifixion, while green symbolizes eternal life, and in particular the evergreen tree, which does not lose its leaves in the winter, and gold is the first color associated with Christmas, as one of the three gifts of the Magi, symbolizing royalty.\nThe Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer. In the United States, these \"German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees.\" When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by \"The School Journal\" in 1897. Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century, it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus. The Christmas tree is considered by some as Christianisation of pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of evergreen boughs, and an adaptation of pagan tree worship; according to eighth-century biographer \u00c6ddi Stephanus, Saint Boniface (634\u2013709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an ax to an oak tree dedicated to Thor and pointed out a fir tree, which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because it pointed to heaven and it had a triangular shape, which he said was symbolic of the Trinity. The English language phrase \"Christmas tree\" is first recorded in 1835 and represents an importation from the German language.\nSince the 16th century, the poinsettia, a native plant from Mexico, has been associated with Christmas carrying the Christian symbolism of the Star of Bethlehem; in that country it is known in Spanish as the \"Flower of the Holy Night\". Other popular holiday plants include holly, mistletoe, red amaryllis, and Christmas cactus.\nOther traditional decorations include bells, candles, candy canes, stockings, wreaths, and angels. Both the displaying of wreaths and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display. The concentric assortment of leaves, usually from an evergreen, make up Christmas wreaths and are designed to prepare Christians for the Advent season. Candles in each window are meant to demonstrate the fact that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the ultimate light of the world.\nChristmas lights and banners may be hung along streets, music played from speakers, and Christmas trees placed in prominent places. It is common in many parts of the world for town squares and consumer shopping areas to sponsor and display decorations. Rolls of brightly colored paper with secular or religious Christmas motifs are manufactured for the purpose of wrapping gifts. In some countries, Christmas decorations are traditionally taken down on Twelfth Night.\nNativity play.\nFor the Christian celebration of Christmas, the viewing of the Nativity play is one of the oldest Christmastime traditions, with the first reenactment of the Nativity of Jesus taking place in A.D. 1223. In that year, Francis of Assisi assembled a Nativity scene outside of his church in Italy and children sung Christmas carols celebrating the birth of Jesus. Each year, this grew larger and people travelled from afar to see Francis' depiction of the Nativity of Jesus that came to feature drama and music. Nativity plays eventually spread throughout all of Europe, where they remain popular. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services often came to feature Nativity plays, as did schools and theatres. In France, Germany, Mexico and Spain, Nativity plays are often reenacted outdoors in the streets.\nMusic and carols.\nThe earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in fourth-century Rome. Latin hymns such as \"Veni redemptor gentium\", written by Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to Arianism. \"Corde natus ex Parentis\" (\"Of the Father's love begotten\") by the Spanish poet Prudentius (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas \"Sequence\" or \"Prose\" was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under Bernard of Clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional Christmas carol.\nThe songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as \"harvest tide\" as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on medieval chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like \"Personent hodie\", \"Good King Wenceslas\", and \"The Holly and the Ivy\" can be traced directly back to the Middle Ages. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. \"Adeste Fideles\" (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century.\nThe singing of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the Protestant Reformation in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like Martin Luther, wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th-century English reformer Charles Wesley understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the Great Awakening in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled \"Hark! How All the Welkin Rings\", later renamed \"Hark! the Herald Angels Sing\".\nCompletely secular Christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. \"Deck the Halls\" dates from 1784, and the American \"Jingle Bells\" was copyrighted in 1857. In the 19th and 20th centuries, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holiday songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music. John Rutter has composed many carols including \"All Bells in Paradise\", \"Angels' Carol\", \"Candlelight Carol\", \"Donkey Carol\", \"Jesus Child\", \"Shepherd's Pipe Carol\" and \"Star Carol\".\nDuring the 19th Century in the United States, there was a significant adoption of Christmas traditions from German and other immgrants, as well as novels by of Charles Dickens, including \"The Pickwick Papers\" and \"A Christmas Carol\". The practices included having Christmas parties, caroling door-to-door, sending Christmas cards, giving gifts, and decorating houses and trees. People displayed nativity scenes and cr\u00e8ches. There were several American Christmas carols composed during the 19th Century, including \"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\" in 1849, \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\" in 1863, and \"Away in a Manger\" in 1885. This time period marked the start of the present-day tradition of American and British choral groups performing Handel's \"Messiah\" during Christmas, rather than during Easter.\nThe Christmas music in the U.S. was influenced by community and church music, as well as radio, television, and recordings. Radio has covered Christmas music from variety shows from the 1940s and 1950s, as well as modern-day stations that exclusively play Christmas music from late November through December 25. Hollywood movies have featured new Christmas music, such as \"White Christmas\" in \"Holiday Inn\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". Traditional carols have also been included in Hollywood films, such as \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), and \"Silent Night\" in \"A Christmas Story\". American Christmas songs include religious carols and hymns, as well as secular songs featuring goodwill, Santa Claus, and gift-giving.\nTraditional cuisine.\nA special Christmas family meal is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions have special meals for Christmas Eve, such as Sicily, where 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as Christmas pudding, mince pies, Christmas cake, Panettone and Yule log cake. Traditional Christmas meal in Central Europe is fried carp or other fish.\nCards.\nChristmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads \"wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\", much like that of the first commercial Christmas card, produced by Sir Henry Cole in London in 1843. The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging E-cards.\nChristmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative, with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem, or a white dove, which can represent both the Holy Spirit and Peace on Earth. Other Christmas cards are more secular and can depict Christmas traditions, mythical figures such as Santa Claus, objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes, and the wildlife of the northern winter. There are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in idealized 19th-century streetscapes.\nSome prefer cards with a poem, prayer, or Biblical verse; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive \"Season's greetings\".\nCommemorative stamps.\nA number of nations have issued commemorative stamps at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail Christmas cards, and they are popular with philatelists. These stamps are regular postage stamps, unlike Christmas seals, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale sometime between early October and early December and are printed in considerable quantities.\nGift giving.\nThe exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for retailers and businesses throughout the world. On Christmas, people exchange gifts based on the Christian tradition associated with Saint Nicholas, and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given to the baby Jesus by the Magi. The practice of gift giving in the Roman celebration of Saturnalia may have influenced Christian customs, but on the other hand the Christian \"core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event\", because it was the Biblical Magi, \"together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life.\"\nGift-bearing figures.\nA number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are Father Christmas, also known as Santa Claus (derived from the Dutch for Saint Nicholas), P\u00e8re No\u00ebl, and the Weihnachtsmann; Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas; the Christkind; Kris Kringle; Joulupukki; tomte/nisse; Babbo Natale; Saint Basil; and Ded Moroz. The Scandinavian tomte (also called nisse) is sometimes depicted as a gnome instead of Santa Claus.\nThe best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch \"Sinterklaas\", which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a 4th-century Greek bishop of Myra, a city in the Roman province of Lycia, whose ruins are from modern Demre in southwest Turkey. Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast day, December 6, came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.\nSaint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the Reformation in 16th\u201317th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or \"Christkindl\", corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.\nThe modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including Washington Irving and the German-American cartoonist Thomas Nast (1840\u20131902). Following the American Revolutionary War, some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of New Amsterdam and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.\nCurrent tradition in several Latin American countries (such as Venezuela and Colombia) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional religious beliefs and the iconography of Santa Claus imported from the United States.\nIn South Tyrol (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Switzerland, the Christkind (Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek in Czech, J\u00e9zuska in Hungarian and Je\u017ei\u0161ko in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from Saint Basil on New Year's Eve, the eve of that saint's liturgical feast. The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus / Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a bishop's dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts, and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by Knecht Ruprecht. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.\nMultiple gift-giver figures exist in Poland, varying between regions and individual families. St Nicholas (\"\u015awi\u0119ty Miko\u0142aj\") dominates Central and North-East areas, the Starman (\"Gwiazdor\") is most common in Greater Poland, Baby Jesus (\"Dzieci\u0105tko\") is unique to Upper Silesia, with the Little Star (\"Gwiazdka\") and the Little Angel (\"Anio\u0142ek\") being common in the South and the South-East. Grandfather Frost (\"Dziadek Mr\u00f3z\") is less commonly accepted in some areas of Eastern Poland. It is worth noting that across all of Poland, St Nicholas is the gift giver on the Saint Nicholas Day on December 6.\nDate according to Julian calendar.\nSome jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, including those of Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Jerusalem, mark feasts using the older Julian calendar. As of , there is a difference of 13 days between the Julian calendar and the modern Gregorian calendar, which is used internationally for most secular purposes. As a result, December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the calendar used by most governments and people in everyday life. Therefore, the aforementioned Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the day that is internationally considered to be January 7.\nHowever, other Orthodox Christians, such as those belonging to the jurisdictions of Constantinople, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Antioch, Alexandria, Albania, Cyprus, Finland, and the Orthodox Church in America, among others, began using the Revised Julian calendar in the early 20th century, which at present corresponds exactly to the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, these Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the same day that is internationally considered to be December 25, and which is also the date of Christmas among Western Christians.\nA further complication is added by the fact that the Armenian Apostolic Church continues the original ancient Eastern Christian practice of celebrating the birth of Christ not as a separate holiday, but on the same day as the celebration of his baptism (Theophany), which is on January 6. This is a public holiday in Armenia, and it is held on the same day that is internationally considered to be January 6, because the Armenian Church in Armenia uses the Gregorian calendar.\nHowever, there is also a small Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which maintains the traditional Armenian custom of celebrating the birth of Christ on the same day as Theophany (January 6), but uses the \"Julian\" calendar for the determination of that date. As a result, this church celebrates \"Christmas\" (more properly called Theophany) on the day that is considered January 19 on the Gregorian calendar in use by the majority of the world.\nIn summary, there are four different dates used by different Christian groups to mark the birth of Christ, given in the table below.\nEconomy.\nChristmas is typically a peak selling season for retailers in many nations around the world. Sales increase dramatically as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate. In the United States, the \"Christmas shopping season\" starts as early as October. In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before Halloween (October 31), and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on November 11. In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid-November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on. In the United States, it has been calculated that a quarter of all personal spending takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season. Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8\u00a0billion in November 2004 to $31.9\u00a0billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent. In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater, there being a November\u2013December buying surge of 100 percent in bookstores and 170 percent in jewelry stores. In the same year employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6\u00a0million to 1.8\u00a0million in the two months leading up to Christmas. Industries completely dependent on Christmas include Christmas cards, of which 1.9\u00a0billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas Trees, of which 20.8\u00a0million were cut in the U.S. in 2002. For 2019, the average US adult was projected to spend $920 on gifts alone. In the UK in 2010, up to \u00a38\u00a0billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales.\nIn most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In England and Wales, the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. Similar legislation was approved in Scotland with the Christmas Day and New Year's Day Trading (Scotland) Act 2007. Film studios release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, fantasy movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the Academy Awards.\nOne economist's analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a deadweight loss under orthodox microeconomic theory, because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4\u00a0billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone. Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elephants, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.\nControversies.\nChristmas has at times been the subject of controversy and attacks from various sources. Historically it was prohibited by Puritans when they briefly held power in England (1647\u20131660), and in Colonial America where the Puritans outlawed the celebration of Christmas in 1659. The Parliament of Scotland, which was dominated by Presbyterians, passed a series of acts outlawing the observance of Christmas between 1637 and 1690; Christmas Day did not become a public holiday in Scotland until 1958. Christmas celebrations have also been prohibited by atheist states such as the Soviet Union and more recently majority Muslim states such as Somalia, Tajikistan and Brunei.\nSome Christians and organizations such as Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice cite alleged attacks on Christmas (dubbing them a \"war on Christmas\"). Such groups claim that any specific mention of the term \"Christmas\" or its religious aspects is being increasingly censored, avoided, or discouraged by a number of advertisers, retailers, government (prominently schools), and other public and private organizations. One controversy is the occurrence of Christmas trees being renamed Holiday trees. In the U.S. there has been a tendency to replace the greeting \"Merry Christmas\" with \"Happy Holidays\", which is considered inclusive at the time of the Jewish celebration of Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and Humanlight. In the U.S. and Canada, where the use of the term \"Holidays\" is most prevalent, opponents have denounced its usage and avoidance of using the term \"Christmas\" as being politically correct. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Lynch v. Donnelly\" that a Christmas display (which included a Nativity scene) owned and displayed by the city of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, did not violate the First Amendment. American Muslim scholar Abdul Malik Mujahid has said that Muslims must treat Christmas with respect, even if they disagree with it.\nThe government of the People's Republic of China officially espouses state atheism, and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end. In December 2018, officials raided Christian churches just prior to Christmastide and coerced them to close; Christmas trees and Santa Clauses were also forcibly removed."}

Contractive maps are sometimes called Lipschitzian maps. If the above condition is instead satisfied for\n\"k\"\u00a0\u2264\u00a01, then the mapping is said to be a non-expansive map.\nMore generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces. Thus, if (\"M\",\u2009\"d\") and (\"N\",\u2009\"d\"') are two metric spaces, then formula_3 is a contractive mapping if there is a constant formula_1 such that\nfor all \"x\" and \"y\" in \"M\".\nEvery contraction mapping is Lipschitz continuous and hence uniformly continuous (for a Lipschitz continuous function, the constant \"k\" is no longer necessarily less than 1).\nA contraction mapping has at most one fixed point. Moreover, the Banach fixed-point theorem states that every contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point, and that for any \"x\" in \"M\" the iterated function sequence \"x\", \"f\"\u2009(\"x\"), \"f\"\u2009(\"f\"\u2009(\"x\")), \"f\"\u2009(\"f\"\u2009(\"f\"\u2009(\"x\"))), ... converges to the fixed point. This concept is very useful for iterated function systems where contraction mappings are often used. Banach's fixed-point theorem is also applied in proving the existence of solutions of ordinary differential equations, and is used in one proof of the inverse function theorem.\nContraction mappings play an important role in dynamic programming problems.\nFirmly non-expansive mapping.\nA non-expansive mapping with formula_6 can be strengthened to a firmly non-expansive mapping in a Hilbert space formula_7 if the following holds for all \"x\" and \"y\" in formula_7:\nwhere\nThis is a special case of formula_11 averaged nonexpansive operators with formula_12. A firmly non-expansive mapping is always non-expansive, via the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality.\nThe class of firmly non-expansive maps is closed under convex combinations, but not compositions. This class includes proximal mappings of proper, convex, lower-semicontinuous functions, hence it also includes orthogonal projections onto non-empty closed convex sets. The class of firmly nonexpansive operators is equal to the set of resolvents of maximally monotone operators. Surprisingly, while iterating non-expansive maps has no guarantee to find a fixed point (e.g. multiplication by -1), firm non-expansiveness is sufficient to guarantee global convergence to a fixed point, provided a fixed point exists. More precisely, if formula_13, then for any initial point formula_14, iterating\nformula_15\nyields convergence to a fixed point formula_16. This convergence might be weak in an infinite-dimensional setting. \nSubcontraction map.\nA subcontraction map or subcontractor is a map \"f\" on a metric space (\"M\",\u2009\"d\") such that\nIf the image of a subcontractor \"f\" is compact, then \"f\" has a fixed point.\nLocally convex spaces.\nIn a locally convex space (\"E\",\u2009\"P\") with topology given by a set \"P\" of seminorms, one can define for any \"p\"\u2009\u2208\u2009\"P\" a \"p\"-contraction as a map \"f\" such that there is some \"k\"\"p\" &lt; 1 such that \u2264 . If \"f\" is a \"p\"-contraction for all \"p\"\u2009\u2208\u2009\"P\" and (\"E\",\u2009\"P\") is sequentially complete, then \"f\" has a fixed point, given as limit of any sequence \"x\"\"n\"+1 = \"f\"(\"x\"\"n\"), and if (\"E\",\u2009\"P\") is Hausdorff, then the fixed point is unique."}

{"id": "6246", "revid": "41176987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6246", "title": "Covalent bond", "text": "A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. In organic chemistry, covalent bonds are much more common than ionic bonds.\nCovalent bonding also includes many kinds of interactions, including \u03c3-bonding, \u03c0-bonding, metal-to-metal bonding, agostic interactions, bent bonds, three-center two-electron bonds and three-center four-electron bonds. The term \"covalent bond\" dates from 1939. The prefix \"co-\" means \"jointly, associated in action, partnered to a lesser degree, \" etc.; thus a \"co-valent bond\", in essence, means that the atoms share \"valence\", such as is discussed in valence bond theory.\nIn the molecule , the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding. Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities. Thus, covalent bonding does not necessarily require that the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable electronegativity. Covalent bonding that entails the sharing of electrons over more than two atoms is said to be delocalized.\nHistory.\nThe term \"covalence\" in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by Irving Langmuir in a \"Journal of the American Chemical Society\" article entitled \"The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules\". Langmuir wrote that \"we shall denote by the term \"covalence\" the number of pairs of electrons that a given atom shares with its neighbors.\"\nThe idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years before 1919 to Gilbert N. Lewis, who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. He introduced the \"Lewis notation\" or \"electron dot notation\" or \"Lewis dot structure\", in which valence electrons (those in the outer shell) are represented as dots around the atomic symbols. Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds. Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds, such as double bonds and triple bonds. An alternative form of representation, not shown here, has bond-forming electron pairs represented as solid lines.\nLewis proposed that an atom forms enough covalent bonds to form a full (or closed) outer electron shell. In the diagram of methane shown here, the carbon atom has a valence of four and is, therefore, surrounded by eight electrons (the octet rule), four from the carbon itself and four from the hydrogens bonded to it. Each hydrogen has a valence of one and is surrounded by two electrons (a duet rule) \u2013 its own one electron plus one from the carbon. The numbers of electrons correspond to full shells in the quantum theory of the atom; the outer shell of a carbon atom is the \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a02 shell, which can hold eight electrons, whereas the outer (and only) shell of a hydrogen atom is the \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a01 shell, which can hold only two.\nWhile the idea of shared electron pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, quantum mechanics is needed to understand the nature of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond (molecular hydrogen) in 1927. Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the atomic orbitals of participating atoms.\nTypes of covalent bonds.\nAtomic orbitals (except for s orbitals) have specific directional properties leading to different types of covalent bonds. Sigma (\u03c3) bonds are the strongest covalent bonds and are due to head-on overlapping of orbitals on two different atoms. A single bond is usually a \u03c3 bond. Pi (\u03c0) bonds are weaker and are due to lateral overlap between p (or d) orbitals. A double bond between two given atoms consists of one \u03c3 and one \u03c0 bond, and a triple bond is one \u03c3 and two \u03c0 bonds.\nCovalent bonds are also affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms which determines the chemical polarity of the bond. Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make nonpolar covalent bonds such as H\u2013H. An unequal relationship creates a polar covalent bond such as with H\u2212Cl. However polarity also requires geometric asymmetry, or else dipoles may cancel out resulting in a non-polar molecule.\nCovalent structures.\nThere are several types of structures for covalent substances, including individual molecules, molecular structures, macromolecular structures and giant covalent structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms together, but there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are usually gases, for example, HCl, SO2, CO2, and CH4. In molecular structures, there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low-boiling-temperature liquids (such as ethanol), and low-melting-temperature solids (such as iodine and solid CO2). Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked by covalent bonds in chains, including synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and nylon, and biopolymers such as proteins and starch. Network covalent structures (or giant covalent structures) contain large numbers of atoms linked in sheets (such as graphite), or 3-dimensional structures (such as diamond and quartz). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical resistivity. Elements that have high electronegativity, and the ability to form three or four electron pair bonds, often form such large macromolecular structures.\nOne- and three-electron bonds.\nBonds with one or three electrons can be found in radical species, which have an odd number of electrons. The simplest example of a 1-electron bond is found in the dihydrogen cation, . One-electron bonds often have about half the bond energy of a 2-electron bond, and are therefore called \"half bonds\". However, there are exceptions: in the case of dilithium, the bond is actually stronger for the 1-electron than for the 2-electron Li2. This exception can be explained in terms of hybridization and inner-shell effects.\nThe simplest example of three-electron bonding can be found in the helium dimer cation, . It is considered a \"half bond\" because it consists of only one shared electron (rather than two); in molecular orbital terms, the third electron is in an anti-bonding orbital which cancels out half of the bond formed by the other two electrons. Another example of a molecule containing a 3-electron bond, in addition to two 2-electron bonds, is nitric oxide, NO. The oxygen molecule, O2 can also be regarded as having two 3-electron bonds and one 2-electron bond, which accounts for its paramagnetism and its formal bond order of 2. Chlorine dioxide and its heavier analogues bromine dioxide and iodine dioxide also contain three-electron bonds.\nMolecules with odd-electron bonds are usually highly reactive. These types of bond are only stable between atoms with similar electronegativities.\nResonance.\nThere are situations whereby a single Lewis structure is insufficient to explain the electron configuration in a molecule, hence a superposition of structures is needed. The same two atoms in such molecules can be bonded differently in different structures (a single bond in one, a double bond in another, or even none at all), resulting in a non-integer bond order. The nitrate ion is one such example with three equivalent structures. The bond between the nitrogen and each oxygen is a double bond in one structure and a single bond in the other two, so that the average bond order for each N\u2013O interaction is = .\nAromaticity.\nIn organic chemistry, when a molecule with a planar ring obeys H\u00fcckel's rule, where the number of \u03c0 electrons fit the formula 4\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a02 (where \"n\" is an integer), it attains extra stability and symmetry. In benzene, the prototypical aromatic compound, there are 6 \u03c0 bonding electrons (\"n\"\u00a0=\u00a01, 4\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0=\u00a06). These occupy three delocalized \u03c0 molecular orbitals (molecular orbital theory) or form conjugate \u03c0 bonds in two resonance structures that linearly combine (valence bond theory), creating a regular hexagon exhibiting a greater stabilization than the hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene.\nIn the case of heterocyclic aromatics and substituted benzenes, the electronegativity differences between different parts of the ring may dominate the chemical behavior of aromatic ring bonds, which otherwise are equivalent.\nHypervalence.\nCertain molecules such as xenon difluoride and sulfur hexafluoride have higher co-ordination numbers than would be possible due to strictly covalent bonding according to the octet rule. This is explained by the three-center four-electron bond (\"3c\u20134e\") model which interprets the molecular wavefunction in terms of non-bonding highest occupied molecular orbitals in molecular orbital theory and resonance of sigma bonds in valence bond theory.\nElectron deficiency.\nIn three-center two-electron bonds (\"3c\u20132e\") three atoms share two electrons in bonding. This type of bonding occurs in boron hydrides such as diborane (B2H6), which are often described as electron deficient because there are not enough valence electrons to form localized (2-centre 2-electron) bonds joining all the atoms. However the more modern description using 3c\u20132e bonds does provide enough bonding orbitals to connect all the atoms, so that the molecules can instead be classified as electron-precise.\nEach such bond (2 per molecule in diborane) contains a pair of electrons which connect the boron atoms to each other in a banana shape, with a proton (the nucleus of a hydrogen atom) in the middle of the bond, sharing electrons with both boron atoms. In certain cluster compounds, so-called four-center two-electron bonds also have been postulated.\nQuantum mechanical description.\nAfter the development of quantum mechanics, two basic theories were proposed to provide a quantum description of chemical bonding: valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory. A more recent quantum description is given in terms of atomic contributions to the electronic density of states.\nComparison of VB and MO theories.\nThe two theories represent two ways to build up the electron configuration of the molecule. For valence bond theory, the atomic hybrid orbitals are filled with electrons first to produce a fully bonded valence configuration, followed by performing a linear combination of contributing structures (resonance) if there are several of them. In contrast, for molecular orbital theory a linear combination of atomic orbitals is performed first, followed by filling of the resulting molecular orbitals with electrons.\nThe two approaches are regarded as complementary, and each provides its own insights into the problem of chemical bonding. As valence bond theory builds the molecular wavefunction out of localized bonds, it is more suited for the calculation of bond energies and the understanding of reaction mechanisms. As molecular orbital theory builds the molecular wavefunction out of delocalized orbitals, it is more suited for the calculation of ionization energies and the understanding of spectral absorption bands.\nAt the qualitative level, both theories contain incorrect predictions. Simple (Heitler\u2013London) valence bond theory correctly predicts the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic molecules into separate atoms, while simple (Hartree\u2013Fock) molecular orbital theory incorrectly predicts dissociation into a mixture of atoms and ions. On the other hand, simple molecular orbital theory correctly predicts H\u00fcckel's rule of aromaticity, while simple valence bond theory incorrectly predicts that cyclobutadiene has larger resonance energy than benzene.\nAlthough the wavefunctions generated by both theories at the qualitative level do not agree and do not match the stabilization energy by experiment, they can be corrected by configuration interaction. This is done by combining the valence bond covalent function with the functions describing all possible ionic structures or by combining the molecular orbital ground state function with the functions describing all possible excited states using unoccupied orbitals. It can then be seen that the simple molecular orbital approach overestimates the weight of the ionic structures while the simple valence bond approach neglects them. This can also be described as saying that the simple molecular orbital approach neglects electron correlation while the simple valence bond approach overestimates it.\nModern calculations in quantum chemistry usually start from (but ultimately go far beyond) a molecular orbital rather than a valence bond approach, not because of any intrinsic superiority in the former but rather because the MO approach is more readily adapted to numerical computations. Molecular orbitals are orthogonal, which significantly increases the feasibility and speed of computer calculations compared to nonorthogonal valence bond orbitals. However, better valence bond programs are now available. \nCovalency from atomic contribution to the electronic density of states.\nIn COOP, COHP and BCOOP, evaluation of bond covalency is dependent on the basis set. To overcome this issue, an alternative formulation of the bond covalency can be provided in this way.\nThe center mass of an atomic orbital ,\nwith quantum numbers , for atom A is defined as\nwhere is the contribution of the atomic orbital of the atom A to the total electronic density of states of the solid\nwhere the outer sum runs over all atoms A of the unit cell. The energy window is chosen in such a way that it encompasses all relevant bands participating in the bond. If the range to select is unclear, it can be identified in practice by examining the molecular orbitals that describe the electron density along with the considered bond.\nThe relative position of the center mass of levels of atom A with respect to the center mass of levels of atom B is given as\nwhere the contributions of the magnetic and spin quantum numbers are summed. According to this definition, the relative position of the A levels with respect to the B levels is\nwhere, for simplicity, we may omit the dependence from the principal quantum number in the notation referring to .\nIn this formalism, the greater the value of , the higher the overlap of the selected atomic bands, and thus the electron density described by those orbitals gives a more covalent A\u2013B bond. The quantity is denoted as the \"covalency\" of the A\u2013B bond, which is specified in the same units of the energy ."}

Condensation polymers are formed by polycondensation, when the polymer is formed by condensation reactions between species of all degrees of polymerization, or by condensative chain polymerization, when the polymer is formed by sequential addition (by condensation reaction) of monomers to an active site in a chain reaction. The main alternative forms of polymerization are chain polymerization and polyaddition, both of which give addition polymers.\nCondensation polymerization is a form of step-growth polymerization. Linear polymers are produced from bifunctional monomers, i.e. compounds with two reactive end groups. Common condensation polymers include polyamides, polyacetals, and proteins.\nPolyamides.\nOne important class of condensation polymers are polyamides. They arise from the reaction of carboxylic acid and an amine. Examples include nylons and proteins. When prepared from amino-carboxylic acids, e.g. amino acids, the stoichiometry of the polymerization includes co-formation of water:\nWhen prepared from diamines and dicarboxylic acids, e.g. the production of nylon 66, the polymerization produces two molecules of water per repeat unit:\nPolyesters.\nOne important class of condensation polymers are polyesters. They arise from the reaction of carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Examples include polyesters, e.g. polyethyleneterephthalate:\nSafety and environmental considerations.\nCondensation polymers tend to be more biodegradable than addition polymers. The peptide or ester bonds between monomers can be hydrolysed, especially in the presence of catalysts or bacterial enzymes."}

Colorado Springs is the second most populous city and the most extensive city in the State of Colorado. It is the principal city of the Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and is the second most prominent city of the Front Range Urban Corridor. It is located in east central Colorado, on Fountain Creek, south of Denver.\nAt the city stands over above sea level, though some areas are significantly higher and lower. Colorado Springs is near the base of Pikes Peak, which rises above sea level on the eastern edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains.\nThe United States Air Force Academy opened just north of Colorado Springs in 1958. The city is home to 24 national sports governing bodies, including the United States Olympic Committee, the United States Olympic Training Center, USA Swimming, and USA Hockey.\nThe city had an estimated population of 478,221 in 2019, and a metro population of approximately 738,939,&lt;ref name=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/\"&gt; United States Census Bureau. Retrieved May 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; making it Colorado's second most populous city, behind Denver, and the 39th most populous city in the United States. The Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area had an estimated population of 712,327 in 2016. The city is in the Front Range Urban Corridor, an oblong region of urban population along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and Wyoming, generally following Interstate 25.\nThe city covers , making it the most extensive municipality in Colorado.\nIn 2020, Colorado Springs ranked #13 on the New York Times 52 Places to Go list and #10 in TripAdvisor's Top 25 Trending Destinations. In 2017 and 2018, Colorado Springs received several accolades. In 2018 \"U.S. News\" named it the most desirable place to live in the United States. The previous year, Colorado Springs placed second on \"U.S. News\"s list of the 125 Best Places to Live in the USA. The Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings found that Colorado Springs was the fastest-growing city for millennials. Thumbtack's annual Small Business Friendliness Survey found Colorado Springs to be the fourth most business-friendly city in the country.\nHistory.\nThe Ute, Arapaho and Cheyenne peoples were the first recorded inhabiting the area which would become Colorado Springs. Part of the territory included in the United States' 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the current city area was designated part of the 1854 Kansas Territory. In 1859, after the first local settlement was established, it became part of the Jefferson Territory on October 24 and of El Paso County on November 28. Colorado City at the Front Range confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks was \"formally organized on August13, 1859\" during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. It served as the capital of the Colorado Territory from November 5, 1861, until August 14, 1862, when the capital was moved to Golden, before it was finally moved to Denver in 1867. So many immigrants from England had settled in Colorado Springs by the early 1870s that Colorado Springs was locally referred to as \"Little London.\" In 1871 the Colorado Springs Company laid out the towns of La Font (later called Manitou Springs) and Fountain Colony, upstream and downstream respectively, of Colorado City. Within a year, Fountain Colony was renamed Colorado Springs and officially incorporated. The El Paso County seat shifted from Colorado City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs. On December 1, 1880, Colorado Springs expanded northward with two annexations.\nThe second period of annexations was during 188990, and included Seavey's Addition, West Colorado Springs, East End, and another North End addition. In 1891 the Broadmoor Land Company built the Broadmoor suburb, which included the Broadmoor Casino, and by December 12, 1895, the city had \"four Mining Exchanges and 275 mining brokers.\" By 1898, the city was designated into quadrants by the north-south Cascade Avenue and the east-west Washington/Pike's Peak avenues.\nFrom 1899 to 1901 Tesla Experimental Station operated on Knob Hill, and aircraft flights to the Broadmoor's neighboring fields began in 1919. Alexander Airport north of the city opened in 1925, and in 1927 the original Colorado Springs Municipal Airport land was purchased east of the city.\nIn World War II the United States Army Air Forces leased land adjacent to the municipal airfield, naming it Peterson Field in December 1942. This was only one of several military presences in and around Colorado Springs during the war.\nIn November 1950, Ent Air Force Base was selected as the Cold War headquarters for Air Defense Command (ADC). The former WWII Army Air Base, Peterson Field, which had been inactivated at the end of the war, was re-opened in 1951 as a U.S. Air Force base. The 1950s through 1970s saw a continued expansion of the military presence in the area, with the establishment of NORAD's headquarters in the city, as well as the ADCOM headquarters.\nBetween 1965 and 1968, the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak Community College and Colorado Technical University were established in or near the city. In 1977 most of the former Ent AFB became a US Olympic training center. The Libertarian Party was founded within the city in the 1970s.\nOn October 1, 1981, the Broadmoor Addition, Cheyenne Canon, Ivywild, Skyway, and Stratton Meadows were annexed after the Colorado Supreme Court \"overturned a district court decision that voided the annexation\". Further annexations expanding the city include the Nielson Addition and Vineyard Commerce Park Annexation in September 2008. \nGeography.\nThe city lies in a semi-arid Steppe climate region with the Southern Rocky Mountains to the west, the Palmer Divide to the north, high plains further east, and high desert lands to the south when leaving Fountain and approaching Pueblo. Colorado Springs is or one hour and five minutes south of Denver by car using I-25.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.19%, is water.\nMetropolitan area.\nColorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area such as parks, bike trails, and open spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities experiencing tremendous growth such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budgetary issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced since 1997, and the annexation of the Banning Lewis Ranch area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.\nClimate.\nColorado Springs has a cooler, dry-winter semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\"), and its location just east of the Rocky Mountains affords it the rapid warming influence from chinook winds during winter but also subjects it to drastic day-to-day variability in weather conditions. The city has abundant sunshine year-round, averaging 243 sunny days per year, and receives approximately of annual precipitation. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005.\nColorado Springs is one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led Nikola Tesla to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.\nSeasonal climate.\nWinters range from mild to moderately cold, with December, the coldest month, averaging ; historically January has been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has had both lower daily maxima and minima. Typically, there are 5.2 nights with sub- lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise above freezing.\nSnowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 8 of the top 10 heaviest 24-hour snowfalls have occurred from March to May. Summers are warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging , and 18 days of + highs annually. Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above . Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the North American Monsoon.\nThe first autumn freeze and the last freeze in the spring, on average, occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall (\u2265) is October 21 through April 25. Extreme temperatures range from on June 26, 2012 and most recently on June 21, 2016, down to on February 1, 1951 and December 9, 1919.\nDemographics.\nAs of the 2010 census, the population of Colorado Springs was 416,427 (40th most populous U.S. city), and the population of the Colorado Springs Metropolitan Statistical Area was 645,613 in 2010 (84th most populous MSA), and the population of the Front Range Urban Corridor in Colorado was an estimated 4,166,855.\nAs of the April 2010 census, 78.8% of the population of the city was White (non-Hispanic Whites were 70.7% of the population, compared with 86.6% in 1970), 16.1% Hispanic or Latino of any race (compared with 7.4% in 1970), 6.3% Black or African American, 3.0% Asian, 1.0% descended from indigenous peoples of the Americas, 0.3% descended from indigenous Hawaiians and other Pacific islanders, 5.5% of some other race, and 5.1% of two or more races. Mexican Americans made up 14.6% of the city's population, compared with 9.1% in 1990. The median age in the city was 35 years.\nEconomy.\nColorado Springs's economy is driven primarily by the military, the high-tech industry, and tourism, in that order. The city is experiencing growth in the service sectors. Its unemployment rate as of October 2015 was 3.9%, a decrease from 4.8% in October 2014 and 7.3% in November 2013, compared to 3.8% for the state and 5.0% for the nation.\nDefense industry.\nThe defense industry forms a significant part of the Colorado Springs economy, with some of the city's largest employers being defense contractors. A large segment of this industry is dedicated to the development and operation of various projects for space and missile defense. With its close ties to defense, the aerospace industry has also influenced Colorado Springs's economy.\nSome defense corporations have left or downsized city campuses, but slight growth has been recorded. Significant defense corporations in the city include Northrop Grumman, Boeing, General Dynamics, L3Harris Technologies, SAIC, ITT, Lockheed Martin, and Bluestaq. The Space Foundation is based in Colorado Springs.\nOn January 13, 2021, the Air Force announced a new permanent home for Space Command, moving it from Colorado Springs to Huntsville, Alabama. Political leaders in Colorado plan to ask President Biden's administration to review the merits of the decision. Huntsville also has to pass an environmental review before the decision is final.\nHigh-tech industry.\nA large percentage of Colorado Springs's economy is still based on manufacturing high-tech and complex electronic equipment. The high-tech sector in the Colorado Springs area has decreased its overall presence from 2000 to 2006 (from around 21,000 to around 8,000), with notable reductions in information technology and complex electronic equipment. Current trends project the high-tech employment ratio will continue to decrease.\nHigh-tech corporations with connections to the city include: Verizon Business, a telecommunications firm, at its height had nearly 1300 employees in 2008. Hewlett-Packard still has some sales, support, and SAN storage engineering center for the computer industry. Storage Networking Industry Association is the home of the SNIA Technology Center. Agilent, spun off from HP in 1999 as an independent, publicly traded company. Intel had 250 employees in 2009. The Intel facility is now used for the centralized unemployment offices, social services, El Paso county offices, and a bitcoin mining facility. Microchip Technology (formerly Atmel), is a chip fabrication organization. Cypress Semiconductor Colorado Design Center is a chip fabrication research and development site. The Apple Inc. facility was sold to Sanmina-SCI in 1996.\nThe National Cybersecurity Center(NCC) was established in Colorado Springs in March 2016. Its core purpose is to provides collaborative cybersecurity knowledge and services to the United States. Currently, the NCC has four active collaboration initiatives: Secure the Vote, NCC Student Alliance, Space ISAC Operations, and its annual Cyber Symposium.\nCulture and contemporary life.\nTourism.\nAlmost immediately following the arrival of railroads beginning in 1871, the city's location at the base of Pikes Peak and the Rocky Mountains made it a popular tourism destination. Tourism is the third largest employer in the Pikes Peak region, accounting for more than 16,000 jobs. In 2018, 23 million day and overnight visitors came to the area, contributing $2.4\u00a0billion in revenue.\nColorado Springs has more than 55 attractions and activities in the area, including Garden of the Gods park, United States Air Force Academy, the ANA Money Museum, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center at Colorado College, Old Colorado City and the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Training Center. In 2020, the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Museum opened; the Flying W Ranch Chuckwagon Dinner &amp; Western Show reopened in 2020. A new Pikes Peak Summit Complex is under construction at the 14,115-foot summit of Pikes Peak, with a scheduled completion date of spring 2021. The Pikes Peak Cog Railway is closed for reconstruction (it is scheduled to reopen in 2021), as is the Cadet Chapel at the U.S. Air Force Academy. Popular hikes in the area include the Manitou Incline and many throughout North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park. \nThe downtown Colorado Springs Visitor Information Center offers free area information to leisure and business travelers. The Cultural Office of the Pikes Peak Region (COPPeR), also downtown, supports and advocates for the arts throughout the Pikes Peak Region. It operates the PeakRadar website to communicate city events.\nAnnual cultural events.\nColorado Springs is home to the annual Colorado Springs Labor Day Liftoff, a hot air balloon festival that takes place over Labor Day weekend at the city's Memorial Park.\nOther annual events include: a comic book convention and science fiction convention called GalaxyFest in February, a pride parade called PrideFest in July, the Greek Festival, the Pikes Peak Ascent and Marathon, and the Steers &amp; Beers Whiskey and Beer Festival in August, and the Emma Crawford Coffin Races and Festival in nearby Manitou Springs and Arts Month in October.\nThe Colorado Springs Festival of Lights is held every December. The Festival includes the Festival of Lights Parade which runs along Tejon Street in Downtown Colorado Springs.\nBreweries.\nIn 2017, the state of Colorado had the third highest number of craft breweries at 348. Breweries and microbreweries have become popular in Colorado Springs, which hosts over 30 of them. In September 2018, Eater named Bristol Brewing Company one of the 38 essential breweries in Colorado.\nReligious institutions.\nAlthough houses of worship of almost every major world religion are within the city, Colorado Springs has in particular attracted a large influx of Evangelical Christians and Christian organizations in recent years. At one time Colorado Springs was the national headquarters for 81 different religious organizations, earning the city the tongue-in-cheek nicknames \"the Evangelical Vatican\" and \"The Christian Mecca.\" Religious groups with regional or international headquarters in Colorado Springs include:\nMarijuana.\nAlthough Colorado voters approved Colorado Amendment 64, a constitutional amendment in 2012 legalizing retail sales of marijuana for recreational purposes, the Colorado Springs city council voted not to permit retail shops in the city, as was allowed in the amendment. Medical marijuana outlets continue to operate in Colorado Springs. As of 2015, there were 91 medical marijuana clinics in the city, which reported sales of $59.6\u00a0million in 2014, up 11 percent from the previous year but without recreational marijuana shops. On April 26, 2016 Colorado Springs city council decided to extend the current six-month moratorium to eighteen months with no new licenses to be granted until May 2017. On July 27, 2017 the Cannabist published an article with a link to a scholarly paper where the author suggested the city will give up 25.4\u00a0million dollars in tax revenue and fees if the city continues to thwart the industry from opening within the city limits. On March 1, 2018 there were 131 medical marijuana centers and no recreational cannabis stores. As of 2019 Colorado Springs is still one of seven towns that have only allowed for medical marijuana\nIn popular culture.\nColorado Springs has been the subject of or setting for many books, movies and television shows, and is a frequent backdrop for political thrillers and military-themed stories because of its many military installations and vital importance to the United States' continental defense. Notable television series using the city as a setting include \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\", \"Homicide Hunter\" and the \"Stargate\" series \"Stargate SG-1\", as well as the films \"WarGames\", \"The Prestige\", and \"BlacKkKlansman\".\nIn a North Korean propaganda video released in April 2013, Colorado Springs was inexplicably singled out as one of four targets for a missile strike. The video failed to pinpoint Colorado Springs on the map, instead showing a spot somewhere in Louisiana.\nSports.\nOlympic sports.\nColorado Springs, dubbed Olympic City USA, is home to the United States Olympic Training Center and the headquarters of the United States Olympic Committee and the United States Anti-Doping Agency. In addition, 24 of the United States' national federations for individual Olympic sports have their headquarters in Colorado Springs, including: US bobsled, fencing, figure skating, basketball, boxing, cycling, judo, field hockey, hockey, swimming, shooting, table tennis, taekwondo, triathlon, volleyball, pentathlon, handball, and wrestling associations and organizations.\nFurther, over 50 national sports organizations (non-Olympic) headquarter in Colorado Springs. These include the National Strength and Conditioning Association, Sports Incubator, a various non-Olympic Sports (such as USA Ultimate), and more.\nColorado Springs and Denver hosted the 1962 World Ice Hockey Championships.\nThe city has a long association with the sport of figure skating, having hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championships six times and the World Figure Skating Championships five times. It is home to the World Figure Skating Museum and Hall of Fame and the Broadmoor Skating Club, a notable training center for the sport. In recent years, the Broadmoor World Arena has hosted skating events such as Skate America and the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships.\nPikes Peak International Hill Climb.\nThe Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (PPIHC), also known as \"The Race to the Clouds,\" is an annual invitational automobile and motorcycle hill climb to the summit of Pikes Peak, every year on the last Sunday of June. The highway wasn't completely paved until 2011.\nLocal Collegiate teams.\nThe local colleges feature many sports teams. Notable among them are the following nationally competitive NCAA Division I teams: United States Air Force Academy (Falcons) Football, Basketball and Hockey, Colorado College (Tigers) Hockey, and Women's Soccer.\nThe Mountain West Conference and the National Collegiate Hockey Conference is based in Colorado Springs.\nRodeo.\nColorado Springs is home to the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame and the headquarters of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.\nColorado Springs was the original headquarters of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) from its founding in 1992 until 2005, when the organization was moved to Pueblo.\nParks, trails and open space.\nThe city's Parks, Recreation and Cultural Services manage 136 neighborhood parks, eight community parks, seven regional parks, and five sports complexes, totaling . They also manage of trails, of which are park trails and are urban. There are of open space in 48 open-space areas.\nParks.\nGarden of the Gods is on Colorado Springs's western edge. It is a National Natural Landmark, with red/orange sandstone rock formations often viewed against a backdrop of the snow-capped Pikes Peak. This park is free to the public and offers many recreational opportunities, such as hiking, rock climbing, cycling, horseback riding and tours. It offers a variety of annual events, one of the most popular of which is the Starlight Spectacular, a recreational bike ride held every summer to benefit the Trails and Open Space Coalition of Colorado Springs.\nColorado Springs has several major city parks, such as Palmer Park, America the Beautiful Park in downtown Colorado Springs, Memorial Park, which includes many sports fields, an indoor swimming pool and skating rink, a skateboard bowl and two half-pipes, and Monument Valley Park, which has walking and biking paths, an outdoor swimming pool and pickleball courts. Monument Valley Park also has Tahama Spring, the original spring in Colorado Springs. Austin Bluffs Park affords a place of recreation in eastern Colorado Springs. El Paso County Regional Parks include Bear Creek Regional Park, Bear Creek Dog Park, Fox Run Regional Park and Fountain Creek Regional Park and Nature Center. Ponderosa pine (\"Pinus ponderosa\"), Gambel oak (\"Quercus gambelii\"), narrowleaf yucca (\"Yucca angustissima\", syn. \"Yucca glauca\") and prickly pear cactus (\"Opuntia macrorhiza\") are some of the more common flora endemic to the Front Range in Colorado Springs.\nTrails.\nThree trails, the New Santa Fe Regional Trail, Pikes Peak Greenway and Fountain Creek Regional Trail, form a continuous path from Palmer Lake, through Colorado Springs, to Fountain, Colorado. The majority of the trail between Palmer Lake and Fountain is a soft surface breeze gravel trail. A major segment of the trail within the Colorado Springs city limits is paved. The trails, except Monument Valley Park trails, may be used for equestrian traffic. Motorized vehicles are not allowed on the trails. Many of the trails are interconnected, having main \"spine\" trails, like the Pikes Peak Greenway, that lead to secondary trails. The Urban Trail system within Colorado Springs consists of more than of multi-use trail for biking, jogging, roller blading and walking.\nGovernment.\nOn November 2, 2010, Colorado Springs voters adopted a council-strong mayor form of government. The City of Colorado Springs transitioned to the new system of government in 2011. Under the council-strong mayor system of government, the mayor is the chief executive and the city council is the legislative branch. The mayor is a full-time elected position and not a member of the council. The council has nine members, six of whom represent one of six equally populated districts each. The remaining three members are elected at-large. The mayor has veto authority, and the city council can override a mayoral veto by a two-thirds majority vote.\nColorado Springs City Hall was built from 1902 to 1904 on land donated by W. S. Stratton.\nCity Council.\nColorado Springs City Council consists of 9 elected officials. 6 represented distracted seats and 3 represent the city at large.\nPolitics.\nIn 2017 Caleb Hannan wrote in \"Politico\" that Colorado Springs was \"staunchly Republican\", \"a right-wing counterweight to liberal Boulder\", and that a study ranked it \"the fourth most conservative city in America\". In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump's margin of victory in El Paso County was 22 points. That year Hannan wrote that downtown Colorado Springs had a different political vibe from the overall area's and that there were \"superficial signs of changing demographics\". In 2020 the shift toward the political center continued as the incumbent Republican, Donald Trump, edged out Democrat Joe Biden by only 10.8% in El Paso County \nEducation.\nElementary and middle schools.\nPublic schools\nThe city's public schools are divided into several districts: \nPrivate schools\nHigher education.\nBachelors and graduate degree programs are offered at these colleges and universities in the city:\nThe United States Air Force Academy is a military school for officer candidates.\nIntelliTec College is a technical training school. Pikes Peak Community College offers a two-year degree program.\nMedia.\nIn March 2016 there were six newspapers actively publishing in Colorado Springs including the newspaper with the largest circulation in the state. Colorado-Pueblo MSA is the 90th largest broadcast market in the US. There are 24 digital television stations in Colorado Springs and 34 radio stations.\nTransportation.\nMajor highways and roads.\nInterstate highways.\nColorado Springs is primarily served by two interstate highways. I-25 runs north and south through Colorado, and traverses the city for nearly , entering the city south of Circle Drive and exiting north of North Gate Boulevard. In El Paso County it is known as Ronald Reagan Highway. US 24 runs across the central mountains, through the city, and onto the plains. From west to east in Colorado Springs, US 24 includes the western portion of Cimarron Street and the Midland Expressway, a concurrent section with I-25/US 87 between exits 139 and 141, part of Fountain Blvd, an expressway called the Martin Luther King Bypass, part of South Powers Blvd (where it is concurrent with Colorado 21), and the easternmost portion of Platte Avenue out of the city.\nState highways.\nA number of state highways serve the city. State Highway 21 is a major east side semi-expressway from Black Forest to Fountain. It is widely known as Powers Boulevard. State Highway 83 runs north\u2013south from Denver to northern Colorado Springs. State Highway 94 runs east\u2013west from western Cheyenne County to eastern Colorado Springs. State Highway 115 begins in Ca\u00f1on City and runs up Nevada Avenue. US 85 and SH 115 are concurrent between Lake Avenue and I-25. US 85 enters the city at Fountain and was signed at Venetucci Blvd, Lake Avenue, and Nevada Avenue.\nCounty and city roads.\nIn November 2015, voters in Colorado Springs overwhelmingly passed ballot measure 2C, dedicating funds from a temporary sales tax increase to much needed road and infrastructure improvements over five years. This temporary increase is estimated to bring in approximately $50 million annually, which will be used solely to improve roads and infrastructure. The ballot measure passed by a margin of approximately 65\u201335%.\nIn 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority and adopted a 1% sales tax dedicated to improving the region's transportation infrastructure. Together with state funding for the Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX) (2007 completion) and the I-25 interchange with Highway 16 (2008 completion), significant progress has been made since 2003 in addressing the transportation needs of the area.\nIn early 2010, the city of Colorado Springs approved an expansion of the northernmost part of Powers Boulevard in order to create an Interstate 25 bypass commonly referred to as the Copper Ridge Expansion.\nAir transport.\nColorado Springs Airport (COS) has been in operation since 1925. It is the second-largest commercial airport in the state, after Denver International Airport (DEN). It covers of land at an elevation of approximately . COS is considered to be a joint-use civilian and military airport, as Peterson Air Force Base is a tenant of the airport. It has three paved runways: 17L/35R is , the runway 17R/35L is and the runway 13/31 is . In 2020 Southwest Airlines announced 13 daily flights with five destinations from COS would begin in early 2021. In 2021 United Airlines announced expanded services at COS.\nRailroads.\nFreight service is provided by Union Pacific and BNSF. Currently there is no intercity passenger service. The city last had passenger service in 1967 with the Denver to Dallas \"Texas Zephyr\" run by the Colorado &amp; Southern Railway and the Fort Worth &amp; Denver Railway (both subsidiaries of the Burlington Route).\nBicycling.\nIn April 2018, the Colorado Springs City Council approved a Bike Master Plan. The vision of the city's Bike Master Plan is \u201ca healthy and vibrant Colorado Springs where bicycling is one of many transportation options for a large portion of the population, and where a well-connected and well-maintained network of urban trails, single-track, and on-street infrastructure offers a bicycling experience for present and future generations that is safe, convenient, and fun for getting around, getting in shape, or getting away.\u201d In October 2018, \"Bicycling\" ranked Colorado Springs the 28th best US city for bicycling. Bike lanes in Colorado Springs have not been deployed without controversy. According to \"The Gazette\", their readers \u201chave mixed feelings for new bike lanes.\u201d In December 2016, the City removed a bike lane along Research Parkway due to overwhelming opposition; an online survey found that 80.5% of respondents opposed the bike lane. The Gazette has stated that since the Bike Master Plan was adopted by City Council, \u201cno issue has elicited more argument in The Gazette pages,\u201d and due to this immense public interest, on February 25, 2019, The Gazette hosted a town hall meeting called \u201cBattle of the Bike Lanes.\u201d \nWalkability.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Colorado Springs 34th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nMountain Metropolitan Transit.\nMountain Metropolitan Transit (MMT) offers public transportation services in the Pikes Peak region providing over 11,000 one-way trips per day. In addition to bus routes within the City of Colorado Springs, Mountain Metro Transit provides service into Manitou Springs, north to the Chapel Hills Mall, east to Peterson Air Force Base and south into the Widefield area.. MMT is testing Battery Electric Buses (BEB), and if the buses perform well, the agency plans to acquire its first three BEBs in 2021 using funds from the Volkswagen emissions scandal and resulting lawsuit and settlement.\nMountain Metro Mobility.\nMountain Metro Mobility is an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) federally mandated complementary ADA paratransit service, which provides demand-response service for individuals with mobility needs that prevent them from using the fixed-route bus system.\nMountain Metro Rides.\nMountain Metro Rides offers alternative transportation options to residents of the Pikes Peak Region. The program is designed to reduce congestion and pollution by encouraging people to commute by carpool, vanpool, bicycling or walking.\nBustang.\nBustang provides intercity transportation to Colorado Springs. It is part of the South and Outrider lines, which connect to Denver and to Lamar. There is an additional line that connects Colorado Springs directly to the Denver Tech Center.\nSister cities.\nColorado Springs' sister cities are:\nColorado Springs's sister city organization began when it became partners with Fujiyoshida. The \"torii\" gate erected to commemorate the relationship stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The \"torii\" gate, crisscrossed bridge and shrine, in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets downtown, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities. A plaque near the \"torii\" gate states that \"the purpose of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the people of our two countries and cities\". The Fujiyoshida Student exchange program has become an annual event.\nTo strengthen relations between the two cities, the Colorado Springs Youth Symphony regularly invites taiko drummers from the city to participate in a joint concert in the Pikes Peak Center. The orchestra played in Bankstown, Australia, in 2002 and again in June 2006 as part of their tours to Australia and New Zealand.\nIn 2006 and 2010, the Bankstown TAP (Talent Advancement Program) performed with the Youth Symphony and the Colorado Springs Children's Chorale as part of the annual \"In Harmony\" program.\nA notable similarity between Colorado Springs and its sister cities is their geographic positions: three of the seven cities are near the foot of a major mountain or mountain range, as is Colorado Springs."}
{"id": "6251", "revid": "1012419719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6251", "title": "Professional certification", "text": "Professional certification, trade certification, or professional designation, often called simply \"certification\" or \"qualification\", is a designation earned by a person to assure qualification to perform a job or task. Not all certifications that use post-nominal letters are an acknowledgement of educational achievement, or an agency appointed to safeguard the public interest.\nOverview.\nA certification is a third-party attestation of an individual's level of knowledge or proficiency in a certain industry or profession. If They aren't\n granted by authorities in the field, such as professional societies and universities, or by private certificate-granting agencies. Most certifications are time-limited; some expire after a period of time (e.g., the lifetime of a product that required certification for use), while others can be renewed indefinitely as long as certain requirements are met. Renewal usually requires ongoing education to remain up-to-date on advancements in the field, evidenced by earning the specified number of continuing education credits (CECs), or continuing education units (CEUs), from approved professional development courses.\nMany certification programs are affiliated with professional associations, trade organizations, or private vendors interested in raising industry standards. Certificate programs are often created or endorsed by professional associations, but are typically completely independent from membership organizations. Certifications are very common in fields such as aviation, construction, technology, environment, and other industrial sectors, as well as healthcare, business, real estate, and finance.\nAccording to \"The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs\" (1997) by Phillip Barnhart, \"certifications are portable, since they do not depend on one company's definition of a certain job\" and they provide potential employers with \"an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience\".\nCertification is different from professional licensure. In the United States, licenses are typically issued by state agencies, whereas certifications are usually awarded by professional societies or educational institutes. Obtaining a certificate is voluntary in some fields, but in others, certification from a government-accredited agency may be legally required to perform certain jobs or tasks. In other countries, licenses are typically granted by professional societies or universities and require a certificate after about three to five years and so on thereafter. The assessment process for certification may be more comprehensive than that of licensure, though sometimes the assessment process is very similar or even the same, despite differing in terms of legal status.\nThe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) defines the standard for being a certifying agency as meeting the following two requirements:\nThe Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE) is a U.S.-based organization that sets standards for the accreditation of personnel certification and certificate programs based on the \"Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing\", a joint publication of the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). Many members of the Association of Test Publishers (ATP) are also certification organizations.\nCategorization.\nThere are three general types of certification. Listed in order of development level and portability, they are: corporate (internal), product-specific, and profession-wide.\nCorporate, or \"internal\" certifications, are made by a corporation or low-stakes organization for internal purposes. For example, a corporation might require a one-day training course for all sales personnel, after which they receive a certificate. While this certificate has limited portability \u2013 to other corporations, for example \u2013 it is the most simple to develop.\nProduct-specific certifications are more involved, and are intended to be referenced to a product across all applications. This approach is very prevalent in the information technology (IT) industry, where personnel are certified on a version of software or hardware. This type of certification is portable across locations (for example, different corporations that use that software), but not across other products. Another example could be the certifications issued for shipping personnel, which are under international standards even for the recognition of the certification body, under the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\nThe most general type of certification is profession-wide. Certification in the medical profession is often offered by particular specialties. In order to apply professional standards, increase the level of practice, and protect the public, a professional organization might establish a certification. This is intended to be portable to all places a certified professional might work. Of course, this generalization increases the cost of such a program; the process to establish a legally defensible assessment of an entire profession is very extensive. An example of this is a Certified Public Accountant\u00a0(CPA), which would not be certified for just one corporation or one piece of accountancy software but for general work in the profession.\nProfessional certificates awarded by tertiary education providers.\nMany tertiary education providers grant professional certificates as an award for the completion of an educational program. The curriculum of a professional certificate is most often in a focused subject matter. Many professional certificates have the same curriculum as master's degrees in the same subject. Many other professional certificates offer the same courses as master's degrees in the same subject, but require the student to take fewer total courses to complete the program. Some professional certificates have a curriculum that more closely resembles a baccalaureate major in the same field. The typical professional certificate program is between 200\u2013300 class-hours in size. It is uncommon for a program to be larger or smaller than that. Most professional certificate programs are open enrollment, but some have admissions processes. A few universities put some of their professional certificates into a subclass they refer to as advanced professional certificates.\nSome of the more commonly offered professional certificates include:\nAdvanced professional certificate.\n\"Advanced professional certificates\" are professional credentials designed to help professionals enhance their job performance and marketability in their respective fields. In many other countries, certificates are qualifications in higher education. In the United States, a certificate may be offered by an institute of higher education. These certificates usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge of a certain vocational subject. Certificate programs can be completed more quickly than associate degrees and often do not have general education requirements.\nAn advanced professional certificate is a result of an educational process designed for individuals. Certificates are designed for both newcomers to the industry as well as seasoned professionals. Certificates are awarded by an educational program or academic institution. Completion of a certificate program indicates completion of a course or series of courses with a specific concentration that is different from an educational degree program. Course content for an advanced certificate is set forth through a variety of sources i.e. faculty, committee, instructors, and other subject matter experts in a related field. The end goal of an advanced professional certificate is so that professionals may demonstrate knowledge of course content at the end of a set period in time.\nInstitutions that offer advance professional certificates in various fields and industries include:\nAreas of certification.\nAccountancy, auditing and finance.\nThere are many professional bodies for accountants and auditors throughout the world; some of them are legally recognized in their jurisdictions.\nPublic accountants are the accountancy and control experts that are legally certified in different jurisdictions to work in public practices, certifying accounts as statutory auditors, eventually selling advice and services to other individuals and businesses. Today, however, many work within private corporations, financial industry, and government bodies.\nAccounting and external auditing.\nCf. Accountancy qualifications and regulation\nAviation.\nAviators are certified through theoretical and in-flight examinations. Requirements for certifications are quite equal in most countries and are regulated by each National Aviation Authority. The existing certificates or pilot licenses are:\nLicensing in these categories require not only examinations but also a minimum number of flight hours. All categories are available for Fixed-Wing Aircraft (airplanes) and Rotatory-Wing Aircraft (helicopters). Within each category, aviators may also obtain certifications in:\nUsually, aviators must be certified also in their log books for the type and model of aircraft they are allowed to fly. Currency checks as well as regular medical check-ups with a frequency of 6 months, 12 months, or 36 months, depending on the type of flying permitted, are obligatory. An aviator can fly only if holding:\nIn Europe, the ANSP, ATCO &amp; ANSP technicians are certified according to EUROCONTROL Safety Regulatory Requirement (ESARRs) (according to EU regulation 2096/2005 \"Common Requirements\").\nCommunications.\nIn the United States, several communications certifications are conferred by the Electronics Technicians Association.\nComputer technology.\nCertification is often used in the professions of software engineering and information technology.\nContract management.\n\u2022 CPCM (Certified Professional Contract Manager) conferred by the National Contract Management Association.\n\u2022 CPM (Commercial Project Manager) conferred by Commercial Officers Group.\nDance.\nConferred by the\u00a0International Dance Council CID\u00a0at\u00a0UNESCO, the International Certification of Dance Studies is awarded to students who have completed 150 hours of classes in a specific form of dance for Level 1. Another 150 hours are required for Level 2 and so on till Level 10. This is the only international certification for dance since the\u00a0International Dance Council CID\u00a0is the official body for all forms of dance; it is usually given in addition to local or national certificates, that is why it is colloquially called \"the dancer's passport\". Students cannot apply for this certification directly \u2013 they have to ask their school to apply on their behalf. This certification is awarded free of charge, there is no cost other than membership fees.\nInternational Dance Council CID\u00a0at\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0administers the\u00a0International Certification of Dance Studies.\nElectronics.\nIn the United States, several electronics certifications are provided by the Electronics Technicians Association.\nEmergency management.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency's EMI offers credentials and training opportunities for United States citizens. Students do not have to be employed by FEMA or be federal employees for some of the programs.\nEngineering.\nProfessional engineering is any act of planning, designing, composing, measuring, evaluating, inspecting, advising, reporting, directing or supervising, or managing any of the foregoing, that requires the application of engineering principles and that concerns the safeguarding of life, health, property, economic interests, the public interest or the environment.\nEvent planning.\nEvent planning includes budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary permits, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, catering, coordinating with third party vendors, and emergency plans.\nCommon event planning certifications include:\nFacility management.\nFacility management can be defined as an aspect of engineering management science that deals with the planning, designing, coordination of space and maintenance of a built environment to enhance quality service management system. Service Quality System includes activities like security, maintenance, catering, and external as well as internal cleaning. In general, it is also the coordination and harmonization of various specialist disciplines to create the best possible working environment for staff.\nFacility management is an interdisciplinary field devoted to the coordination of space, infrastructure, people and organization, often associated with the administration of office blocks, arenas, schools, convention centers, shopping complexes, hospitals, hotels, etc. However, FM facilitates on a wider range of activities than just business services and these are referred to as non-core functions.\nWarehousing management.\nA warehouse management system (WMS) is a part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and storage of materials within a warehouse and process the associated transactions, including shipping, receiving, putaway and picking. The systems also direct and optimize stock putaway based on real-time information about the status of bin utilization. A WMS monitors the progress of products through the warehouse. It involves the physical warehouse infrastructure, tracking systems, and communication between product stations.\nMore precisely, warehouse management involves the receipt, storage and movement of goods, (normally finished goods), to intermediate storage locations or to a final customer. In the multi-echelon model for distribution, there may be multiple levels of warehouses. This includes a central warehouse, a regional warehouses (serviced by the central warehouse) and potentially retail warehouses (serviced by the regional warehouses).\nExplosive atmospheres.\nIECEx covers the specialized field of explosion protection associated with the use of equipment in areas where flammable gases, liquids and combustible dusts may be present. This system provides the assurance that equipment is manufactured to meet safety standards, and that services such as installation, repair and overhaul also comply with IEC International Standards on 60079 series. The UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe), cited IECEx as one example of a practice model for the verification of conformity to IEC Standards, for European smaller countries with no certification schemes for such equipment. It published a \"Common Regulatory Framework\" as a suggestion for those countries implementing a certification program for the explosive atmospheres' segment.\nInsurance and risk management.\nIn the United States, insurance professionals are licensed separately by each state. Many individuals seek one or more certifications to distinguish themselves from their peers.\nLanguage education.\nTESOL is a large field of employment with widely varying degrees of regulation. Most provision worldwide is through the state school system of each individual country, and as such, the instructors tend to be trained primary- or secondary school teachers who are native speakers of the language of their pupils, and not of English. Though native speakers of English have been working in non-English speaking countries in this capacity for years, it was not until the last twenty-five years or so that there was any widespread focus on training particularly for this field. Previously, workers in this sort of job were people engaging in backpacker tourism hoping to earn some extra travel money or well-educated professionals in other fields volunteering, or retired people. These sort of people are certainly still to be found, but there are many who consider TESOL their main profession.\nOne of the problems facing these full-time teachers is the absence of an international governing body for the certification or licensure of English language teachers. However, Cambridge University and its subsidiary body UCLES are pioneers in trying to get some degree of accountability and quality control to consumers of English courses, through their CELTA and DELTA programs. Trinity College London has equivalent programs, the CertTESOL and the LTCL DipTESOL. They offer initial certificates in teaching, in which candidates are trained in language awareness and classroom techniques, and given a chance to practice teaching, after which feedback is reported. Both institutions have as a follow-up a professional diploma, usually taken after a year or two in the field. Although the initial certificate is available to anyone with a high school education, the diploma is meant to be a post-graduate qualification and can in fact be incorporated into a master's degree program.\nLegal affairs.\nAn increasing number of attorneys are choosing to be recognized as having special expertise in certain fields of law. According to the American Bar Association, a lawyer who is a certified specialist has been recognized by an independent professional certifying organization as having an enhanced level of skill and expertise, as well as substantial involvement in an established legal specialty. These organizations require a lawyer to demonstrate special training, experience and knowledge to ensure that the lawyer's recognition is meaningful and reliable. Lawyer conduct with regard to specialty certification is regulated by the states.\nLegal administrators vary in their day-to-day responsibilities and job requirements. The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) is the credentialing body of the Certified Legal Manager (CLM) certification program. CLMs are recognized as administrators who have passed a comprehensive examination and have met other eligibility requirements.: \nLogistics and transport.\nLogistician is the profession in the logistics and transport sectors, including sea, air, land and rail modes. Professional qualification for logisticians usually carries post-nominal letters.\nCertification granting bodies include, but are not limited to, Association for Operations Management (APICS), Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), International Society of Logistics (SOLE), Canadian Institute of Traffic and Transportation (CITT), and Allied Council for Commerce and Logistics (ACCL).\nMinisters.\nChurches have their own process of who may use various religious titles. Protestant churches typically require a Masters of Divinity, accreditation by the denomination and ordination by the local church in order for a minister to become a \"Reverend\". Those qualifications may or may not also give government authorization to solemnize marriages.\nMedicine.\nBoard certification is the process by which a physician in the United States documents by written, practical or computer based testing, illustrating a mastery of knowledge and skills that define a particular area of medical specialization. The American Board of Medical Specialties, a not-for-profit organization, assists 24 approved medical specialty boards in the development and use of standards in the ongoing evaluation and certification of physicians.\nMedical specialty certification in the United States is a voluntary process. While medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients, it is not specialty specific. Board certification demonstrates a physician's exceptional expertise in a particular specialty or sub-specialty of medical practice.\nPatients, physicians, health care providers, insurers and quality organizations regard certification as an important measure of a physician's knowledge, experience and skills to provide quality health care within a given specialty.\nOther professional certifications include certifications such as medical licenses, Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, nursing board certification, diplomas in social work. The Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy certifies pharmacists that are knowledgeable about principles of geriatric pharmacotherapy and the provision of pharmaceutical care to the elderly. Additional certifying bodies relating to the medical field include:\nPeer support.\nNCPRP stands for \"National Certified Peer Recovery Professional\", and the NCPRP credential and exam were developed in collaboration with the International Certification Board of Recovery Professionals (ICBRP) and is currently being administered by PARfessionals.\nPARfessionals is a professional organization and all of the available courses are professional development and pre-certification courses.\nThe NCPRP credential and exam focus primarily on the concept of peer recovery through mental health and addiction recovery. It has the main purpose of training student-candidates on how to become peer recovery professionals who can provide guidance, knowledge or assistance for individuals who have had similar experiences.\nEach student-candidate must complete several key steps which include initial registration; the pre-certification review course; and all applicable sections of the official application in order to become eligible to complete the final step, which is the NCPRP certification exam.\nThe NCPRP credential is obtained once a participant successfully passes the NCPRP certification exam by the second attempt and is valid for five years.\nProject management.\nOrganizations that offer various certifications include:\nPublic relations.\nIn the US, the Universal Accreditation Board, an organization composed of the Public Relations Society of America, the Agricultural Relations Council, the National School Public Relations Association, the Religious Communicators Council and other public relations professional societies, administers the Accreditation in Public Relations (APR), a voluntary certification program for public relations practitioners.\nPublic Participation.\nThe Certified Public Participation Professional (CP3) and Master Certified Public Participation Professional (MCP3) are awarded by two regions of the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) : IAP2 Canada and IAP2 USA. As of 2019, only 25 individuals had achieved either of these distinctions. The CP3 designation is awarded upon successfully completing a three-step process that includes a written application documenting the individual's experience in the profession, a written response to a case study, and an in-person oral assessment.\nIndividuals seeking certification are assessed against 5 Core Competencies, which are the essential capabilities for a professional in this field to effectively design, implement, and evaluate public participation programs. The competencies emerged from qualitative analysis of a comprehensive list of knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, skills, behaviors, and capabilities identified in June 2014 by more than 100 P2 professionals from around the world. The descriptions and quality standards for each competency were developed, tested, and refined through an iterative process involving IAP2 members. Each competency is further divided into individual criteria. An individual must meet or exceed every criterion to achieve the CP3 designation. IAP2 USA's program includes 29 criteria. IAP2 Canada's program includes 31 criteria; the two additional criteria in Canada address federal requirements for indigenous engagement. The MCP3 designation recognizes additional specialization and expertise and is assessed through a written application available only to individuals who have already achieved the CP3 designation.\nTo maintain professional certification, individuals must maintain active membership in IAP2, provide a minimum of 20 hours (annually) of volunteer (unpaid) service to IAP2, and participate in a minimum of 12 hours (annually) of continued professional development.\nSales.\nOrganizations offering certification include:\nSpeaking.\nConferred by the National Speakers Association, the Certified Speaking Professional (CSP) is the speaking profession's international measure of professional platform competence. This certification is awarded by the National Speakers Association. Only about 10% of the speakers who belong to the Global Speakers Federation (GSF) hold this designation. Those who have earned their certification have done so by demonstrating a track record of experience and expertise.\nCriticisms.\nPolitical commentators have criticized professional or occupational licensing, especially medical and legal licensing, for restricting the supply of services and therefore making them more expensive, often putting them out of reach of the poor.\nThe proliferation of IT certifications (both offered and attained) has led some technologists to question their value. Proprietary content that has been distributed on the Internet allows some to gain credentials without the implied depth or breadth of expertise."}
{"id": "6255", "revid": "37278201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6255", "title": "Carl Menger", "text": "Carl Menger (; ; 28 February 1840 \u2013 26 February 1921) was an Austrian economist and the founder of the Austrian School of economics. Menger contributed to the development of the theory of marginalism (marginal utility), which rejected the cost-of-production theories of value, such as were developed by the classical economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo. As a departure from such, he would go on to call his resultant perspective, the \"Subjective Theory of Value\".\nBiography.\nMenger was born in the city of Neu-Sandez in Galicia, Austrian Empire, which is now Nowy S\u0105cz in Poland. He was the son of a wealthy family of minor nobility; his father, Anton, was a lawyer. His mother, Caroline, was the daughter of a wealthy Bohemian merchant. He had two brothers, Anton and Max, both prominent as lawyers. His son, Karl Menger, was a mathematician who taught for many years at Illinois Institute of Technology.\nAfter attending \"Gymnasium\" he studied law at the Universities of Prague and Vienna and later received a doctorate in jurisprudence from the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w. In the 1860s Menger left school and enjoyed a stint as a journalist reporting and analyzing market news, first at the \"Lemberger Zeitung\" in Lemberg, Austrian Galicia (now Lviv, Ukraine) and later at the \"Wiener Zeitung\" in Vienna.\nDuring the course of his newspaper work he noticed a discrepancy between what the classical economics he was taught in school said about price determination and what real world market participants believed. In 1867 Menger began a study of political economy which culminated in 1871 with the publication of his \"Principles of Economics\" \"(Grunds\u00e4tze der Volkswirtschaftslehre),\" thus becoming the father of the Austrian School of economic thought. It was in this work that he challenged classical cost-based theories of value with his theory of marginality \u2013 that price is determined at the margin.\nIn 1872 Menger was enrolled into the law faculty at the University of Vienna and spent the next several years teaching finance and political economy both in seminars and lectures to a growing number of students. In 1873 he received the university's chair of economic theory at the very young age of 33.\nIn 1876 Menger began tutoring Archduke Rudolf von Habsburg, the Crown Prince of Austria in political economy and statistics. For two years Menger accompanied the prince in his travels, first through continental Europe and then later through the British Isles. He is also thought to have assisted the crown prince in the composition of a pamphlet, published anonymously in 1878, which was highly critical of the higher Austrian aristocracy. His association with the prince would last until Rudolf's suicide in 1889 (see the Mayerling Affair).\nIn 1878 Rudolf's father, Emperor Franz Josef, appointed Menger to the chair of political economy at Vienna. The title of \"Hofrat\" was conferred on him, and he was appointed to the Austrian \"Herrenhaus\" in 1900.\nEnsconced in his professorship, he set about refining and defending the positions he took and methods he utilized in \"Principles,\" the result of which was the 1883 publication of \"Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics (Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der politischen Oekonomie insbesondere).\" The book caused a firestorm of debate, during which members of the Historical school of economics began to derisively call Menger and his students the \"Austrian School\" to emphasize their departure from mainstream economic thought in (Germany) \u2013 the term was specifically used in an unfavorable review by Gustav von Schmoller.\nIn 1884 Menger responded with the pamphlet \"The Errors of Historicism in German Economics\" and launched the infamous \"Methodenstreit,\" or methodological debate, between the Historical School and the Austrian School. During this time Menger began to attract like-minded disciples who would go on to make their own mark on the field of economics, most notably Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, and Friedrich von Wieser.\nIn the late 1880s Menger was appointed to head a commission to reform the Austrian monetary system. Over the course of the next decade he authored a plethora of articles which would revolutionize monetary theory, including \"The Theory of Capital\" (1888) and \"Money\" (1892). Largely due to his pessimism about the state of German scholarship, Menger resigned his professorship in 1903 to concentrate on study.\nPhilosophical influences.\nThere are different opinions on the philosophical influences. But it is without discussion that there is a rudimentary dispute of Menger with Plato and a very meticulous one with Aristotle, especially with his ethics.\n\u201cPlato holds that money is an agreed sign for change and Aristotle says, that money came into being as an agreement, not by nature, but by law.\u201d \nAlso the influence of Kant is provable. Many authors emphasize also Rationalism and Idealism, as is represented by Christian Wolff. Looking at the literature, most writers think that Menger represents an essential Aristotelian position. This is surprisingly a position that is contrary to his theory of the subjective value and his individualistic methodological position.\nAnother entry is the use of deduction or induction. \u00a0With his pricetheory can be shown that Menger is nominalistic and, stronger, anti-essentialistic. That is to say that his approach is inductionalistic. \nEconomics.\nMenger used his subjective theory of value to arrive at what he considered one of the most powerful insights in economics: \"\"both sides gain from exchange\"'.\nUnlike William Jevons, Menger did not believe that goods provide \"utils,\" or units of utility. Rather, he wrote, goods are valuable because they serve various uses whose importance differs. Menger also came up with an explanation of how money develops that is still accepted by some schools of thought today."}

In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies or hunter-gatherers; however, sometimes it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves. Civilizations are organized densely-populated settlements divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.\nCivilization, as its etymology (see below) suggests, is a concept originally associated with towns and cities. The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally connected with the final stages of the Neolithic Revolution, culminating in the relatively rapid process of urban revolution and state-formation, a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite.\nHistory of the concept.\nThe English word \"civilization\" comes from the 16th-century French \"civilis\u00e9\" (\"civilized\"), from Latin \"civilis\" (\"civil\"), related to \"civis\" (\"citizen\") and \"civitas\" (\"city\"). The fundamental treatise is Norbert Elias's \"The Civilizing Process\" (1939), which traces social mores from medieval courtly society to the Early Modern period. In \"The Philosophy of Civilization\" (1923), Albert Schweitzer outlines two opinions: one purely material and the other material and ethical. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, \"the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress\".\nRelated words like \"civility\" developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun \"civilization\", meaning \"civilized condition\", came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau, and the first use in English is attributed to Adam Ferguson, who in his 1767 \"Essay on the History of Civil Society\" wrote, \"Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation\". The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of progress characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment.\nIn the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution, \"civilization\" was used in the singular, never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French. The use of \"civilizations\" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century, but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning culture (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of ethnography). Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a \"medieval civilization\", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.\nAlready in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of Rousseau, particularly his work about education, \"\". Here, civilization, being more rational and socially driven, is not fully in accord with human nature, and \"human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original discursive or prerational natural unity\" (see noble savage). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by Johann Gottfried Herder and later by philosophers such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by \"conscious, rational, deliberative acts\", but a kind of pre-rational \"folk spirit\". Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to \"vices of social life\" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice. In World War II, Leo Strauss, having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind Nazism and German militarism and nihilism.\nCharacteristics.\nSocial scientists such as V. Gordon Childe have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society. Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of government, social stratification, economic systems, literacy and other cultural traits. Andrew Nikiforuk argues that \"civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities\" and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.\nAll civilizations have depended on agriculture for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources. Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization, irrigation and crop rotation. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare. Grain surpluses have been especially important because grain can be stored for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides producing food for a living: early civilizations included soldiers, artisans, priests and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.\nCivilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word \"civilization\" is sometimes simply defined as \"\"'living in cities\"'\". Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.\nCompared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the state. State societies are more stratified than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The ruling class, normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a government or bureaucracy. Morton Fried, a conflict theorist and Elman Service, an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and social inequality. This system of classification contains four categories\nEconomically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more personal possessions than nomadic people. Some people also acquire landed property, or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must trade their goods and services for food in a market system, or receive food through the levy of tribute, redistributive taxation, tariffs or tithes from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a gift economy supplemented by limited barter systems. By the early Iron Age, contemporary civilizations developed money as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites.\nWriting, developed first by people in Sumer, is considered a hallmark of civilization and \"appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state\". Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, the writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown by the Inca civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all but except for a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes: the \"Quipus\", and still functioned as a civilized society.\nAided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized religion, development in the arts, and countless new advances in science and technology.\nThrough history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some \"primitive\", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. \"Primitive\" implies in some way that a culture is \"first\" (Latin = \"primus\"), that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity, though this has been demonstrated not to be true. Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Anthropologists today use the term \"non-literate\" to describe these peoples.\nCivilization has been spread by colonization, invasion, religious conversion, the extension of bureaucratic control and trade, and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.\nAssessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trading or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its division of labour, and the carrying capacity of its urban centres. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and tort-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, metallurgy, political structures and organized religion.\nTraditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and economic power defined themselves as \"civilized\" as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence\u00a0\u2013 calling the latter barbarians, savages, and primitives.\nCultural identity.\n\"Civilization\" can also refer to the culture of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state-based decision making apparatus, a literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion and complex customs of education, coercion and control associated with maintaining the elite.\nThe intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being Chinese civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.\nIt is precisely the protection of this cultural identity that is becoming increasingly important nationally and internationally. According to international law, the United Nations and UNESCO try to set up and enforce relevant rules. The aim is to preserve the cultural heritage of humanity and also the cultural identity, especially in the case of war and armed conflict. According to Karl von Habsburg, President of Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets is also part of psychological warfare. The target of the attack is often the opponent's cultural identity, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main target. It is also intended to destroy the particularly sensitive cultural memory (museums, archives, monuments, etc), the grown cultural diversity and the economic basis (such as tourism) of a state, region or community.\nMany historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher Oswald Spengler, uses the German word \"Kultur\", \"culture\", for what many call a \"civilization\". Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as \"the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable\".\nThis \"unified culture\" concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian Arnold J. Toynbee in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume \"A Study of History,\" which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five \"arrested civilizations\". Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a \"creative minority\", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.\nSamuel P. Huntington defines civilization as \"the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species\". Huntington's theories about civilizations are discussed below.\nComplex systems.\nAnother group of theorists, making use of systems theory, looks at a civilization as a complex system, i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex social system and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial and misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.\nSystems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the Silk Road through Central Asia and Indian Ocean sea routes linking the Roman Empire, Persian Empire, India and China, were well established 2000 years ago when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long-distance trade is in the ancient world. During the Uruk period, Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan. Resin found later in the Royal Cemetery at Ur is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.\nMany theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single \"world system\", a process known as globalization. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration \u2013 cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic \u2013 is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. David Wilkinson has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the \"Central Civilization\" around 1500 BCE. Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the \"clash of civilizations\" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the Crusades as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since ancient times, and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism. \nHistory.\nThe notion of world history as a succession of \"civilizations\" is an entirely modern one. In the European Age of Discovery, emerging Modernity was put into stark contrast with the Neolithic and Mesolithic stage of the cultures of many of the peoples they encountered.\nThe term \"civilization\" as it is now most commonly understood, a complex state with centralization, social stratification and specialization of labour, corresponds to early empires that arise in the Fertile Crescent in the Early Bronze Age, around roughly 3000 BC.\nGordon Childe defined the emergence of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the Neolithic Revolution, triggering the development of settled communities, and the Urban Revolution.\nUrban Revolution.\nAt first, the Neolithic was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, with the result that population densities could rise significantly.\nThis encouraged a secondary products revolution in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts\u00a0\u2013 a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.\nThe earlier neolithic technology and lifestyle were established first in Western Asia (for example at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, from about 9,130 BCE), and later in the Yellow River and Yangtze basins in China (for example the Pengtoushan culture from 7,500 BCE), and later spread.\nMesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, with civilizations developing from 6,500 years ago. This area has been identified as having \"inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of the cursive script.\"\nSimilar pre-civilized \"neolithic revolutions\" also began independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern South America (the Norte Chico civilization) and Mesoamerica.\nThe 8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event and the 5.9 Kiloyear Interpluvial saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts. This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of endemic violence between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations.\nThis \"urban revolution\" marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. It was associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare, the rapid development of hierarchies, and the appearance of human sacrifice.\nThe civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of sedentism, the domestication of grains and animals, the permanence of settlements and development of lifestyles that facilitated economies of scale and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors. The transition from \"complex cultures\" to \"civilizations\", while still disputed, seems to be associated with the development of state structures, in which power was further monopolized by an elite ruling class who practiced human sacrifice.\nTowards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist Chalcolithic civilizations began to rise in various \"cradles\" from around 3300 BCE, expanding into large-scale empires in the course of the Bronze Age (Old Kingdom of Egypt, Akkadian Empire, Assyrian Empire, Old Assyrian Empire, Hittite Empire).\nA parallel development took place independently in the Pre-Columbian Americas. Urbanization in the Norte Chico civilization in coastal Peru emerged about 3200 BCE; the oldest known Mayan city, located in Guatemala, dates to about 750 BCE. and Teotihuacan in Mexico was one of the largest cities in the world in 350 CE with a population of about 125,000.\nAxial Age.\nThe Bronze Age collapse was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE, during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which Karl Jaspers termed the Axial Age, presented as a critical transitional phase leading to classical civilization.\nWilliam Hardy McNeill proposed that this period of history was one in which cultural contact between previously separate civilizations saw the \"closure of the oecumene\" and led to accelerated social change from China to the Mediterranean, associated with the spread of coinage, larger empires and new religions. This view has recently been championed by Christopher Chase-Dunn and other world systems theorists.\nModernity.\nA major technological and cultural transition to modernity began approximately 1500 CE in Western Europe, and from this beginning new approaches to science and law spread rapidly around the world, incorporating earlier cultures into the technological and industrial society of the present.\nFall of civilizations.\nCivilizations are traditionally understood as ending in one of two ways; either through incorporation into another expanding civilization (e.g. As Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapsing and reverting to a simpler form of living, as happens in so-called Dark Ages.\nThere have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.\nFuture.\nPolitical scientist Samuel Huntington has argued that the defining characteristic of the 21st century will be a clash of civilizations. According to Huntington, conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between nation-states and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries. These views have been strongly challenged by others like Edward Said, Muhammed Asadi and Amartya Sen. Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris have argued that the \"true clash of civilizations\" between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in political ideology, although they note that this lack of tolerance is likely to lead to an eventual rejection of (true) democracy. In \"Identity and Violence\" Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed \"civilization\", defined by religion and culture only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences.\nCultural Historian Morris Berman suggests in \"Dark Ages America: the End of Empire\" that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness\u2015extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth\u2015have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible. Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, Jane Jacobs who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.\nCultural critic and author Derrick Jensen argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion. Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as \"a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities\", with \"cities\" defined as \"people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life\". This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.\nThe Kardashev scale classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The scale is only hypothetical, but it puts energy consumption in a cosmic perspective. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist.\nNon-human civilizations.\nThe current scientific consensus is that human beings are the only animal species with the cognitive ability to create civilizations. A recent thought experiment, however, has considered whether it would \"be possible to detect an industrial civilization in the geological record\" given the paucity of geological information about eras before the quaternary."}
{"id": "6259", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6259", "title": "Civilization (video game)", "text": "Sid Meier's Civilization is a 1991 turn-based strategy 4X video game developed and published by MicroProse. The game was originally developed for MS-DOS running on a PC, and has undergone numerous revisions for various platforms. The player is tasked with leading an entire human civilization over the course of several millennia by controlling various areas such as urban development, exploration, government, trade, research, and military. The player can control individual units and advance the exploration, conquest and settlement of the game's world. The player can also make such decisions as setting forms of government, tax rates and research priorities. The player's civilization is in competition with other computer-controlled civilizations, with which the player can enter diplomatic relationships that can either end in alliances or lead to war.\n\"Civilization\" was designed by Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley following the successes of \"Silent Service\", \"Sid Meier's Pirates!\" and \"Railroad Tycoon\". \"Civilization\" has sold 1.5 million copies since its release, and is considered one of the most influential computer games in history due to its establishment of the 4X genre. In addition to its commercial and critical success, the game has been deemed pedagogically valuable due to its presentation of historical relationships. A multiplayer remake, Sid Meier's CivNet, was released for the PC in 1995. \"Civilization\" was followed by several sequels with similar or modified scenarios.\nGameplay.\n\"Civilization\" is a turn-based single- or multiplayer strategy game. The player takes on the role of the ruler of a civilization, starting with one (or occasionally two) settler units, and attempts to build an empire in competition with two to seven other civilizations. The game requires a fair amount of micromanagement (although less than other simulation games). Along with the larger tasks of exploration, warfare and diplomacy, the player has to make decisions about where to build new cities, which improvements or units to build in each city, which advances in knowledge should be sought (and at what rate), and how to transform the land surrounding the cities for maximum benefit. From time to time the player's towns may be harassed by barbarians, units with no specific nationality and no named leader. These threats only come from huts, unclaimed land or sea, so that over time and turns of exploration, there are fewer and fewer places from which barbarians will emanate.\nBefore the game begins, the player chooses which historical or current civilization to play. In contrast to later games in the \"Civilization\" series, this is largely a cosmetic choice, affecting titles, city names, musical heralds, and color. The choice does affect their starting position on the \"Play on Earth\" map, and thus different resources in one's initial cities, but has no effect on starting position when starting a random world game or a customized world game. The player's choice of civilization also prevents the computer from being able to play as that civilization or the other civilization of the same color, and since computer-controlled opponents display certain traits of their civilizations this affects gameplay as well. The Aztecs are both fiercely expansionist and generally extremely wealthy, for example. Other civilizations include the Americans, the Mongols, and Romans. Each civilization is led by a famous historical figure, such as Mahatma Gandhi for India.\nThe scope of \"Civilization\" is larger than most other games. The game begins in 4000 BC, before the Bronze Age, and can last through to AD 2100 (on the easiest setting) with Space Age and \"future technologies\". At the start of the game there are no cities anywhere in the world: the player controls one or two settler units, which can be used to found new cities in appropriate sites (and those cities may build other settler units, which can go out and found new cities, thus expanding the empire). Settlers can also alter terrain, build improvements such as mines and irrigation, build roads to connect cities, and later in the game they can construct railroads which offer unlimited movement.\nAs time advances, new technologies are developed; these technologies are the primary way in which the game changes and grows. At the start, players choose from advances such as pottery, the wheel, and the alphabet to, near the end of the game, nuclear fission and spaceflight. Players can gain a large advantage if their civilization is the first to learn a particular technology (the secrets of flight, for example) and put it to use in a military or other context. Most advances give access to new units, city improvements or derivative technologies: for example, the chariot unit becomes available after the wheel is developed, and the granary building becomes available to build after pottery is developed. The whole system of advancements from beginning to end is called the technology tree, or simply the Tech tree; this concept has been adopted in many other strategy games. Since only one tech may be \"researched\" at any given time, the order in which technologies are chosen makes a considerable difference in the outcome of the game and generally reflects the player's preferred style of gameplay.\nPlayers can also build \"Wonders of the World\" in each of the epochs of the game, subject only to obtaining the prerequisite knowledge. These wonders are important achievements of society, science, culture and defense, ranging from the Pyramids and the Great Wall in the Ancient age, to Copernicus' Observatory and Magellan's Expedition in the middle period, up to the Apollo program, the United Nations, and the Manhattan Project in the modern era. Each wonder can only be built once in the world, and requires a lot of resources to build, far more than most other city buildings or units. Wonders provide unique benefits to the controlling civilization. For example, Magellan's Expedition increases the movement rate of naval units. Wonders typically affect either the city in which they are built (for example, the Colossus), every city on the continent (for example, J.S. Bach's Cathedral), or the civilization as a whole (for example, Darwin's Voyage). Some wonders are made obsolete by new technologies.\nThe game can be won by conquering all other civilizations or by winning the space race by reaching the star system of Alpha Centauri.\nDevelopment.\nPrior \"Civilization\"-named games.\nBritish designer Francis Tresham released his \"Civilization\" board game in 1980 under his company Hartland Trefoil. Avalon Hill had obtained the rights to publish it in the United States in 1981.\nThere were at least two attempts to make a computerized version of Tresham's game prior to 1990. Danielle Bunten Berry planned to start work on the game after completing \"M.U.L.E.\" in 1983, and again in 1985, after completing \"The Seven Cities of Gold\" at Electronic Arts. In 1983 Bunten and producer Joe Ybarra opted to first do \"Seven Cities of Gold\". The success of \"Seven Cities\" in 1985 in turn led to a sequel, \"Heart of Africa\". Bunten never returned to the idea of \"Civilization\". Don Daglow, designer of \"Utopia\", the first simulation game, began work programming a version of \"Civilization\" in 1987. He dropped the project, however, when he was offered an executive position at Br\u00f8derbund, and never returned to the game.\nDevelopment at MicroProse.\nSid Meier and Bill Stealey co-founded MicroProse in 1982 to develop flight simulators and other military strategy video games based on Stealey's past experiences as a United States Air Force pilot. Around 1989, Meier wanted to expand his repertoire beyond these types of games, as just having finished \"F-19 Stealth Fighter\" (1988, 1990), he said \"Everything I thought was cool about a flight simulator had gone into that game.\" He took to heart the success of the new god game genre in particular \"SimCity\" (1989) and \"Populous\" (1989). Specifically with \"SimCity\", Meier recognized that video games could still be entertaining based on building something up. By then, Meier was not an official employee of MicroProse but worked under contract where the company paid him upfront for game development, a large payment on delivery of the game, and additional royalties on each game of his sold.\nMicroProse had hired a number of Avalon Hill game designers, including Bruce Shelley. Among other works, Shelley had been responsible for adapting the railroad-based \"1829\" board game developed by Tresham into \"\". Shelley had joined MicroProse finding that the board game market was weakening in contrast to the video game market, and initially worked on \"F-19 Stealth Fighter\". Meier recognized Shelley's abilities and background in game design and took him on as personal assistant designer to brainstorm new game ideas. The two initially worked on ideas for \"Covert Action\", but had put these aside when they came up with the concepts for \"Railroad Tycoon\" (1990), based loosely on the \"1829\"/\"1830\" board games. \"Railroad Tycoon\" was generally well received at its release, but the title did not fit within the nature of flight simulators and military strategy from MicroProse's previous catalog. Meier and Shelley had started a sequel to \"Railroad Tycoon\" shortly after its release, but Stealey canceled the project.\nOne positive aspect both had taken from \"Railroad Tycoon\" was the idea of multiple smaller systems working together at the same time and the player having to manage them. Both Meier and Shelley recognized that the complex interactions between these systems led players to \"make a lot of interesting decisions\", and that ruling a whole civilization would readily work well with these underlying systems. Some time later, both discussed their love of the original \"Empire\" computer games, and Meier challenged Shelley to give him ten things he'd change about \"Empire\"; Shelley provided him with twelve. Around May 1990, Meier presented Shelley with a 5-1/4\" floppy disk which contained the first prototype of \"Civilization\" based on their past discussions and Shelley's list.\nMeier described his development process as sculpting with clay. His prototype took elements from \"Empire\", \"Railroad Tycoon\", \"SimCity\" and the \"Civilization\" board game. This initial version of this game was a real-time simulation, with the player defining zones for their population to grow similar to zoning in \"SimCity\". Meier and Shelley went back and forth with this, with Shelley providing suggestions based on his playthrough and acting as the game's producer, and Meier coding and reworking the game to address these points, and otherwise without involvement of other MicroProse staff. During this period, Stealey and the other managers became concerned that this game did not fit MicroProse's general catalog as computer strategies games had yet proven successful. A few months into the development, Stealey requested them to put the project on hold and complete \"Covert Action\", after which they could go back to their new game. Meier and Shelley completed \"Covert Action\" which was published in 1990.\nOnce \"Covert Action\" was released, Meier and Shelley returned to the prototype. The time away from the project allowed them to recognize that the real-time aspect was not working well, and reworked the game to become turn-based and dropped the zoning aspect, a change that Meier described as \"like tossing the clay in the trash and getting a new lump\". They incorporated elements of city management and military aspect from \"Empire\", including creating individual military units as well as settler units that replaced the functionality of the zoning approach. Meier felt adding military and combat to the game was necessary as \"The game really isn't about being civilized. The competition is what makes the game fun and the players play their best. At times, you have to make the player uncomfortable for the good of the player\". Meier also opted to include a technology tree that would help to open the game to many more choices to the player as it continued, creating a non-linear experience. Meier felt players would be able to use the technology tree to adopt a style of play and from which they could use technologies to barter with the other opponents. While the game relies on established recorded history, Meier admitted he did not spend much time in research, usually only to assure the proper chronology or spellings; Shelley noted that they wanted to design for fun, not accuracy, and that \"Everything we needed was pretty much available in the children\u2019s section of the library.\"\n\"Computer Gaming World\" reported in 1994 that \"Sid Meier has stated on numerous occasions that he emphasizes the 'fun parts' of a simulation and throws out the rest\". Meier described the process as \"Add another bit [of clay]\u2014no, that went too far. Scrape it off\". He eliminated the potential for any civilization to fall on its own, believing this would be punishing to the player. \"Though historically accurate\", Meier said, \"The moment the Krakatoa volcano blew up, or the bubonic plague came marching through, all anybody wanted to do was reload from a\nsaved game\". Meier omitted multiplayer alliances because the computer used them too effectively, causing players to think that it was cheating. He said that by contrast, minefields and minesweepers caused the computer to do \"stupid things ... If you've got a feature that makes the AI look stupid, take it out. It's more important not to have stupid AI than to have good AI\". Meier also omitted jets and helicopters because he thought players would not find obtaining new technologies in the endgame useful, and online multiplayer support because of the small number of online players (\"if you had friends, you wouldn't need to play computer games\"); he also did not believe that online play worked well with turn-based play. The game was developed for the IBM PC platform, which at the time had support for both 16-color EGA to 256-color VGA; Meier opted to stay with the basic EGA support to allow the game to run on both EGA and VGA systems.\n\"I\u2019ve never been able to decide if it was a mistake to keep Civ isolated as long as I did\", Meier wrote; while \"as many eyes as possible\" are beneficial during development, Meier and Shelley worked very quickly together, combining the roles of playtester, game designer, and programmer. Meier and Shelley neared the end of their development and started presenting the game to the rest of MicroProse for feedback towards publication. This process was slowed by the current vice president of development, who had taken over Meier's former position at the company. This vice president did not receive any financial bonuses for successful publication of Meier's games due to Meier's contract terms, forgoing any incentive to provide the needed resources to finish the game. The management had also expressed issue with the lack of a firm completion date, as according to Shelley, Meier would consider a game completed only when he felt he had completed it. Eventually the two got the required help for publication, with Shelley overseeing these processes and Meier making the necessary coding changes.\n\"One of my big rules has always been, 'double it, or cut it in half'\", Meier wrote. He cut the map's size in half less than a month before \"Civilization\"s release after playtesting revealed that the previous size was too large and made for boring and repetitive gameplay. Other automated features, like city management, were modified to require more player involvement. They also eliminated a secondary branch of the technology tree with minor skills like beer brewing, and spent time reworking the existing technologies and units to make sure they felt appropriate and did not break the game. Most of the game was originally developed with art crafted by Meier, and MicroProse's art department helped to create most of the final assets, though some of Meier's original art was used. Shelley wrote out the \"Civilopedia\" entries for all the elements of the game and the game's large manual.\nThe name \"Civilization\" came late in the development process. MicroProse recognized at this point the 1980 \"Civilization\" board game may conflict with their video game, as it shared a similar theme including the technology tree. Meier had noted the board game's influence but considered it not as great as \"Empire\" or \"SimCity\", while others have noted significant differences that made the video game far different from the board game such as the non-linearity introduced by Meier's technology tree. To avoid any potential legal issues, MicroProse negotiated a license to use the \"Civilization\" name from Avalon Hill. The addition of Meier's name to the title was from a current practice established by Stealey to attach games like \"Civilization\" that diverged from MicroProse's past catalog to Meier's name, so that players that played Meier's combat simulators and recognized Meier's name would give these new games a try. This approach worked, according to Meier, and he would continue this naming scheme for other titles in the future as a type of branding.\nBy the time the game was completed and ready for release, Meier estimated that it had cost $170,000 in development. \"Civilization\" was released in early 1991. Because of the animosity that MicroProse's management had towards Meier's games, there was very little promotion of the title, though interest in the game through word-of-mouth helped to boost sales. Following the release on the IBM PC, the game was ported to other platforms; Meier and Shelley provided this code to contractors hired by MicroProse to complete the ports.\n\"CivNet\".\n\"Civilization\" was released with only single-player support, with the player working against multiple computer opponents. In 1991, Internet or online gaming was still in its infancy, so this option was not considered in \"Civilization\"s release. Over the next few years, as home Internet accessibility took off, MicroProse looked to develop an online version of \"Civilization\". This led to the 1995 release of \"Sid Meier's CivNet\". \"CivNet\" allowed for up to seven players to play the game, with computer opponents available to obtain up to six active civilizations. Games could be played either on a turn-based mode, or in a simultaneous mode where each player took their turn at the same time and only progressing to the next turn once all players have confirmed being finished that turn. The game, in addition to better support for Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, supported connectivity through LAN, primitive Internet play, modem, and direct serial link, and included a local hotseat mode. \"CivNet\" also included a map editor and a \"king builder\" to allow a player to customize the names and looks of their civilization as seen by other players.\nAccording to Brian Reynolds, who led the development of \"Civilization II\", MicroProse \"sincerely believed that \"CivNet\" was going to be a much more important product\" than the next single-player \"Civilization\" game that he and Jeff Briggs had started working on. Reynolds said that because their project was seen as a side effort with little risk, they were able to innovate new ideas into \"Civilization II\". As a net result, \"CivNet\" was generally overshadowed by \"Civilization II\" which was released in the following year.\nPost-release.\n\"Civilization\"s critical success created a \"golden period of MicroProse\" where there was more potential for similar strategy games to succeed, according to Meier. This put stress on the company's direction and culture. Stealey wanted to continue to pursue the military-themed titles, while Meier wanted to continue his success with simulation games. Shelley left MicroProse in 1992 and joined Ensemble Studios, where he used his experience with \"Civilization\" to design the \"Age of Empires\" games. Stealey had pushed MicroProse to develop console and arcade-based versions of their games, but this put the company into debt, and Stealey eventually sold the company to Spectrum HoloByte in 1993; Spectrum HoloByte kept MicroProse as a separate company on acquisition.\nMeier would continue and develop \"Civilization II\" along with Brian Reynolds, who served in a similar role to Shelley as design assistant, as well as help from Jeff Briggs and Douglas Kaufman. This game was released in early 1996, and is considered the first sequel of any Sid Meier game. Stealey eventually sold his shares in MicroProse and left the company, and Spectrum HoloByte opted to consolidate the two companies under the name MicroProse in 1996, eliminating numerous positions at MicroProse in the process. As a result, Meier, Briggs, and Reynolds all opted to leave the company and founded Firaxis, which by 2005 became a subsidiary of Take-Two. After a number of acquisitions and legal actions, the \"Civilization\" brand (both as a board game and video game) is now owned by Take-Two, and Firaxis, under Meier's oversight, continues to develop games in the \"Civilization\" series.\nReception.\n\"Civilization\" has been called one of the most important strategy games of all time, and has a loyal following of fans. This high level of interest has led to the creation of a number of free and open source versions and inspired similar games by other commercial developers.\nWhen previewing \"Civilization\" in December 1991, \"Computer Gaming World\" stated that \"a new Olympian in the genre of god games has truly emerged\", comparing its importance to computer games to that of the wheel. The game was reviewed in 1992 in \"Dragon\" #183 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. They commented: \"\"Civilization\" is one of the highest dollar-to-play-ratio entertainments we've enjoyed. The scope is enormous, the strategies border on being limitless, the excitement is genuinely high, and the experience is worth every dime of the game's purchase price.\"\nJeff Koke reviewed \"Civilization\" in \"Pyramid\" #2 (July/Aug., 1993), and stated that \"Ultimately, there are games that are a lot flashier than \"Civilization\", with cool graphics and animation, but there aren't many - or any - in my book that have the ability to absorb the player so totally and to provide an interesting, unique outcome each and every time it's played.\"\n\"Civilization\" won the Origins Award in the category Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1991. A 1992 \"Computer Gaming World\" survey of wargames with modern settings gave the game five stars out of five, describing it as \"more addictive than crack ... so rich and textured that the documentation is incomplete\". In 1992 the magazine named it the Overall Game of the Year, in 1993 added the game to its Hall of Fame, and in 1996 chose \"Civilization\" as the best game of all time:\nA critic for \"Next Generation\" judged the Super NES version to be a disappointing port, with a cumbersome menu system (particularly that the \"City\" and \"Production\" windows are on separate screens), an unintuitive button configuration, and ugly scaled down graphics. However, he gave it a positive recommendation due to the strong gameplay and strategy of the original game: \"if you've never taken a crack at this game before, be prepared to lose hours, even days, trying to conquer those pesky Babylonians.\" Sir Garnabus of \"GamePro\", in contrast, was pleased with the Super NES version's interface, and said the graphics and audio are above that of a typical strategy game. He also said the game stood out among the Super NES's generally action-oriented library.\nIn 2000, GameSpot rated \"Civilization\" as the tenth most influential video game of all time. It was also ranked at fourth place on IGN's 2000 list of the top PC games of all time. In 2004, readers of \"Retro Gamer\" voted it as the 29th top retro game. In 2007, it was named one of the 16 most influential games in history at a German technology and games trade show Telespiele. In Poland, it was included in the retrospective lists of the best Amiga games by Wirtualna Polska (ranked ninth) and \"CHIP\" (ranked fifth). In 2012, \"Time\" named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time. In 1994, \"PC Gamer US\" named \"Civilization\" the second best computer game ever. The editors wrote, \"The depth of strategies possible is impressive, and the look and feel of the game will keep you playing and exploring for months. Truly a remarkable title.\" That same year, \"PC Gamer UK\" named its Windows release the sixth best computer game of all time, calling it Sid Meier's \"crowning glory.\"\nOn March 12, 2007, \"The New York Times\" reported on a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon, which included \"Civilization\".\nBy the release of \"Civilization II\" in 1996, \"Civilization\" had sold over 850,000 copies. By 2001, sales had reached 1 million copies. Shelley stated in a 2016 interview that \"Civilization\" had sold 1.5 million copies.\nMusic.\nCivilization is also known for its excellent music library, such as Baba Yetu, composed by Christopher Tin, which won the 2011 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s).\nLegacy.\nThere have been several sequels to \"Civilization\", including \"Civilization II\" (1996), \"Civilization III\" (2001), \"Civilization IV\" (2005), \"Civilization Revolution\" (2008), \"Civilization V\" (2010), and \"Civilization VI\" in 2016. In 1994, Meier produced a similar game titled \"Colonization\".\n\"Civilization\" is generally considered the first major game in the genre of \"4X\", with the four \"X\"s equating to \"explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate\", a term developed by Alan Emrich in promoting 1993's \"Master of Orion\". While other video games with the principles of 4X had been released prior to \"Civilization\", future 4X games would attribute some of their basic design principles to \"Civilization\".\nAn easter egg named \"Nuclear Gandhi\" in most of the games in the series references a supposed integer overflow bug in \"Civilization\" that causes a computer-controlled Gandhi, normally a highly peaceful leader, to become a nuclear warmonger. The game is said to start Gandhi's \"aggression value\" at 1 out of a maximum 255 possible for a 8-bit unsigned integer, making a computer-controlled Gandhi tend to avoid armed conflict. However, once a civilization achieves Democracy as its form of government, its leader's aggression value falls by 2. Under normal arithmetic principles, Gandhi's \"1\" would be reduced to \"-1\", but because the value is an 8-bit unsigned integer, it wraps around to \"255,\" causing Gandhi to suddenly become the most aggressive opponent in the game. Interviewed in 2019, developer Brian Reynolds said with \"99.99% certainty\" that this story was apocryphal, recalling Gandhi's coded aggression level as being no lower than other peaceful leaders in the game, and doubting that a wraparound would have had the effect described. He noted that all leaders in the game become \"pretty ornery\" after their acquisition of nuclear weapons, and suggested that this behaviour simply seemed more surprising and memorable when it happened to Gandhi. Meier, in his autobiography, stated \"That kind of bug comes from something called unsigned characters, which are not the default in the C programming language, and not something I used for the leader traits. Brian Reynolds wrote Civ II in C++, and he didn't use them, either. We received no complaints about a Gandhi bug when either game came out, nor did we send out any revisions for one. Gandhi's military aggressiveness score remained at 1 throughout the game.\" He then explains that a user named \"Tunafish\" made up the overflow error story on TVTropes in 2012. It spread from there to a Wikia entry, then eventually to Reddit, and was picked up by news sites like Kotaku and Geek.com.\nAnother relic of \"Civilization\" was the nature of combat where a military unit from earlier civilization periods could remain in play through modern times, gaining combat bonuses due to veteran proficiency, leading to these primitive units easily beating out modern technology against all common sense, with the common example of a veteran phalanx unit able to fend off a battleship. Meier noted that this resulted from not anticipating how players would use units, expecting them to have used their forces more like a war-based board game to protect borders and maintain zones of control rather than creating \"stacks of doom\". Future civilization games have had many changes in combat systems to prevent such oddities, though these games do allow for such random victories.\nThe 1999 game \"Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri\" was also created by Meier and is in the same genre, but with a futuristic/space theme; many of the interface and gameplay innovations in this game eventually made their way into \"Civilization III\" and \"IV\". \"Alpha Centauri\" is not actually a sequel to \"Civilization\", despite beginning with the same event that ends \"Civilization\" and \"Civilization II\": a manned spacecraft from Earth arrives in the Alpha Centauri star system. Firaxis' 2014 game \"\", although bearing the name of the main series, is a reimagining of \"Alpha Centauri\" running on the engine of \"Civilization V\".\nA 1994 \"Computer Gaming World\" survey of space war games stated that \"the lesson of this incredibly popular wargame has not been lost on the software community, and technological research popped up all over the place in 1993\", citing \"Spaceward Ho!\" and \"Master of Orion\" as examples. That year MicroProse published \"Master of Magic\", a similar game but embedded in a medieval-fantasy setting where instead of technologies the player (a powerful wizard) develops spells, among other things. In 1999, Activision released \"\", a sequel of sorts to \"Civilization II\" but created by a completely different design team. \"Call to Power\" spawned a sequel in 2000, but by then Activision had lost the rights to the \"Civilization\" name and could only call it \"Call to Power II\".\nAn open source clone of \"Civilization\" has been developed under the name of \"Freeciv\", with the slogan \"'Cause civilization should be free.\" This game can be configured to match the rules of either \"Civilization\" or \"Civilization II\". Another game that partially clones Civilization is a public domain game called \"C-evo\"."}

{"id": "6267", "revid": "9913007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6267", "title": "Cultural imperialism", "text": "Cultural imperialism, also called cultural colonialism, comprises the cultural aspects of imperialism. \"Imperialism\" here refers to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between civilisations, favouring a more powerful civilisation. Thus cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting and imposing a culture (usually that of a politically powerful country) over a less powerful society. This may take the form of cultural hegemony of industrialised or politically and economically influential countries influencing general cultural values and standardising (globalising) civilisations elsewhere.\nThe term \"cultural imperialism\" occurs especially in the fields of history, cultural studies, and postcolonial theory. It is usually used in a pejorative sense, often in conjunction with calls to reject such influence. Cultural imperialism may take various forms, such as an attitude, a formal policy, or military action - insofar as each of these re-inforces cultural hegemony.\nBackground and definitions.\nAlthough the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has a 1921 reference to the \"cultural imperialism of the Russians\", John Tomlinson, in his book on the subject, writes that the term emerged in the 1960s and has been a focus of research since at least the 1970s. Terms such as \"media imperialism\", \"structural imperialism\", \"cultural dependency and domination\", \"cultural synchronization\", \"electronic colonialism\", \"ideological imperialism\", and \"economic imperialism\" have all been used to describe the same basic notion of cultural imperialism.\nCultural imperialism is a process that intends to transition the \u201ccultural symbols of the invading communities from \u2018foreign\u2019 to \u2018natural,\u2019\u2018domestic,\u2019\u201d comments Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera. The process of Cultural Conquest often involves three discrete and sequential phases:\nWhile the third phase continues \"in perpetuity,\" cultural imperialism tends to be \u201cgradual, contested (and continues to be contested), and is by nature incomplete. The partial and imperfect configuration of this ontology takes an implicit conceptualization of reality and attempts\u2014and often fails\u2014to elide other forms of collective existence.\u201d In order to achieve that end, cultural engineering projects strive to \u201cisolate residents within constructed spheres of symbols\u201d such that they (eventually, in some cases after several generations) abandon other cultures and identify with the new symbols. \u201cThe broader intended outcome of these interventions might be described as a common recognition of \"possession\" of the land itself (on behalf of the organizations publishing and financing the images).\u201d\nVarious academics link the term to specific media. American media critic Herbert Schiller wrote: \"The concept of cultural imperialism today [1975] best describes the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system. The public media are the foremost example of operating enterprises that are used in the penetrative process. For penetration on a significant scale the media themselves must be captured by the dominating/penetrating power. This occurs largely through the commercialization of broadcasting.\"\nTom McPhail defined \"Electronic colonialism as the dependency relationship established by the importation of communication hardware, foreign-produced software, along with engineers, technicians, and related information protocols, that establish a set of foreign norms, values, and expectations which, in varying degrees, may alter the domestic cultures and socialization processes.\" Paul Siu-Nam Lee observed that \"communication imperialism can be defined as the process in which the ownership and control over the hardware and software of mass media as well as other major forms of communication in one country are singly or together subjugated to the domination of another country with deleterious effects on the indigenous values, norms and culture.\" Ogan saw \"media imperialism often described as a process whereby the United States and Western Europe produce most of the media products, make the first profits from domestic sales, and then market the products in Third World countries at costs considerably lower than those the countries would have to bear to produce similar products at home.\"\nDowning and Sreberny-Mohammadi state: \"Imperialism is the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one. Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force. In the history of colonialism, (i.e., the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners), the educational and media systems of many Third World countries have been set up as replicas of those in Britain, France, or the United States and carry their values. Western advertising has made further inroads, as have architectural and fashion styles. Subtly but powerfully, the message has often been insinuated that Western cultures are superior to the cultures of the Third World.\"\nNeedless to say, all these authors agree that cultural imperialism promotes the interests of certain circles within the imperial powers, often to the detriment of the target societies.\nThe issue of cultural imperialism emerged largely from communication studies. However, cultural imperialism has been used as a framework by scholars to explain phenomena in the areas of international relations, anthropology, education, science, history, literature, and sports.\nTheoretical foundations.\nMany of today's academics that employ the term, \"cultural imperialism,\" are heavily informed by the work of Foucault, Derrida, Said, and other poststructuralist and postcolonialist theorists. Within the realm of postcolonial discourse, \"cultural imperialism\" can be seen as the cultural legacy of colonialism, or forms of social action contributing to the continuation of Western hegemony. To some outside of the realm of this discourse, the term is critiqued as being unclear, unfocused, and/or contradictory in nature.\nMichel Foucault.\nThe work of French philosopher and social theorist Michel Foucault has heavily influenced use of the term \"cultural imperialism,\" particularly his philosophical interpretation of power and his concept of governmentality.\nFollowing an interpretation of power similar to that of Machiavelli, Foucault defines power as immaterial, as a \"certain type of relation between individuals\" that has to do with complex strategic social positions that relate to the subject's ability to control its environment and influence those around itself. According to Foucault, power is intimately tied with his conception of truth. \"Truth\", as he defines it, is a \"system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution, circulation, and operation of statements\" which has a \"circular relation\" with systems of power. Therefore, inherent in systems of power, is always \"truth\", which is culturally specific, inseparable from ideology which often coincides with various forms of hegemony. \"Cultural imperialism\" may be an example of this.\nFoucault's interpretation of governance is also very important in constructing theories of transnational power structure. In his lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Foucault often defines governmentality as the broad art of \"governing\", which goes beyond the traditional conception of governance in terms of state mandates, and into other realms such as governing \"a household, souls, children, a province, a convent, a religious order, a family\". This relates directly back to Machiavelli's treatise on how to retain political power at any cost, \"The Prince\", and Foucault's aforementioned conceptions of truth and power. (i.e. various subjectivities are created through power relations that are culturally specific, which lead to various forms of culturally specific governmentality such as neoliberal governmentality.)\nEdward Sa\u00efd.\nInformed by the works of Noam Chomsky, Foucault, and Antonio Gramsci, Edward Sa\u00efd is a founding figure of postcolonialism, established with the book \"Orientalism\" (1978), a humanist critique of The Enlightenment, which criticises Western knowledge of \"The East\"\u2014specifically the English and the French constructions of what is and what is not \"Oriental\". Whereby said \"knowledge\" then led to cultural tendencies towards a binary opposition of the Orient vs. the Occident, wherein one concept is defined in opposition to the other concept, and from which they emerge as of unequal value. In \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993), the sequel to \"Orientalism\", Sa\u00efd proposes that, despite the formal end of the \"age of empire\" after the Second World War (1939\u201345), colonial imperialism left a cultural legacy to the (previously) colonised peoples, which remains in their contemporary civilisations; and that said \"cultural imperialism\" is very influential in the international systems of power.\nGayatri Chakravorty Spivak.\nA self-described \"practical Marxist-feminist-deconstructionist\" Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has published a number of works challenging the \"legacy of colonialism\" including \"A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Towards a History of the Vanishing Present\" (1999), \"Other Asias\" (2005), and \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" (1988).\nIn \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" Spivak critiques common representations in the West of the Sati, as being controlled by authors other than the participants (specifically English colonizers and Hindu leaders). Because of this, Spivak argues that the subaltern, referring to the communities that participate in the Sati, are not able to represent themselves through their own voice. Spivak says that cultural imperialism has the power to disqualify or erase the knowledge and mode of education of certain populations that are low on the social hierarchy.\nThroughout \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\", Spivak cites the works of Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and Edward Said, among others.\nIn \"A Critique of Postcolonial Reason\", Spivak argues that Western philosophy has a history of not only exclusion of the subaltern from discourse, but also does not allow them to occupy the space of a fully human subject.\nContemporary ideas and debate.\n\"Cultural imperialism\" can refer to either the forced acculturation of a subject population, or to the voluntary embracing of a foreign culture by individuals who do so of their own free will. Since these are two very different referents, the validity of the term has been called into question.\nCultural influence can be seen by the \"receiving\" culture as either a threat to or an enrichment of its cultural identity. It seems therefore useful to distinguish between cultural imperialism as an (active or passive) attitude of superiority, and the position of a culture or group that seeks to complement its own cultural production, considered partly deficient, with imported products.\nThe imported products or services can themselves represent, or be associated with, certain values (such as consumerism). According to one argument, the \"receiving\" culture does not necessarily perceive this link, but instead absorbs the foreign culture passively through the use of the foreign goods and services. Due to its somewhat concealed, but very potent nature, this hypothetical idea is described by some experts as \"\"banal imperialism\".\" For example, it is argued that while \"American companies are accused of wanting to control 95 percent of the world's consumers\", \"cultural imperialism involves much more than simple consumer goods; it involved the dissemination of American principles such as freedom and democracy\", a process which \"may sound appealing\" but which \"masks a frightening truth: many cultures around the world are disappearing due to the overwhelming influence of corporate and cultural America\".\nSome believe that the newly globalised economy of the late 20th and early 21st century has facilitated this process through the use of new information technology. This kind of cultural imperialism is derived from what is called \"soft power\". The theory of electronic colonialism extends the issue to global cultural issues and the impact of major multi-media conglomerates, ranging from Viacom, Time-Warner, Disney, News Corp, to Google and Microsoft with the focus on the hegemonic power of these mainly United States-based communication giants.\nCultural diversity.\nOne of the reasons often given for opposing any form of cultural imperialism, voluntary or otherwise, is the preservation of cultural diversity, a goal seen by some as analogous to the preservation of ecological diversity. Proponents of this idea argue either that such diversity is valuable in itself, to preserve human historical heritage and knowledge, or instrumentally valuable because it makes available more ways of solving problems and responding to catastrophes, natural or otherwise.\nIdeas relating to African colonisation.\nOf all the areas of the world that scholars have claimed to be adversely affected by imperialism, Africa is probably the most notable. In the expansive \"age of imperialism\" of the nineteenth century, scholars have argued that European colonisation in Africa has led to the elimination of many various cultures, worldviews, and epistemologies, particularly through neocolonisation of public education. This, arguably has led to uneven development, and further informal forms of social control having to do with culture and imperialism. A variety of factors, scholars argue, lead to the elimination of cultures, worldviews, and epistemologies, such as \"de-linguicization\" (replacing native African languages with European ones), devaluing ontologies that are not explicitly individualistic, and at times going as far as to not only define Western culture itself as science, but that non-Western approaches to science, the Arts, indigenous culture, etc. are not even knowledge. One scholar, Ali A. Abdi, claims that imperialism inherently \"involve[s] extensively interactive regimes and heavy contexts of identity deformation, misrecognition, loss of self-esteem, and individual and social doubt in self-efficacy.\" Therefore, all imperialism would always, already be cultural.\nTies to neoliberalism.\nNeoliberalism is often critiqued by sociologists, anthropologists, and cultural studies scholars as being culturally imperialistic. Critics of neoliberalism, at times, claim that it is the newly predominant form of imperialism. Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Dunn and Julia Elyachar have claimed that neoliberalism requires and creates its own form of governmentality.\nIn Dunn's work, \"Privatizing Poland\", she argues that the expansion of the multinational corporation, Gerber, into Poland in the 1990s imposed Western, neoliberal governmentality, ideologies, and epistemologies upon the post-soviet persons hired. Cultural conflicts occurred most notably the company's inherent individualistic policies, such as promoting competition among workers rather than cooperation, and in its strong opposition to what the company owners claimed was bribery.\nIn Elyachar's work, \"Markets of Dispossession\", she focuses on ways in which, in Cairo, NGOs along with INGOs and the state promoted neoliberal governmentality through schemas of economic development that relied upon \"youth microentrepreneurs.\" Youth microentrepreneurs would receive small loans to build their own businesses, similar to the way that microfinance supposedly operates. Elyachar argues though, that these programs not only were a failure, but that they shifted cultural opinions of value (personal and cultural) in a way that favoured Western ways of thinking and being.\nTies to development studies.\nOften, methods of promoting development and social justice are critiqued as being imperialistic in a cultural sense. For example, Chandra Mohanty has critiqued Western feminism, claiming that it has created a misrepresentation of the \"third world woman\" as being completely powerless, unable to resist male dominance. Thus, this leads to the often critiqued narrative of the \"white man\" saving the \"brown woman\" from the \"brown man.\" Other, more radical critiques of development studies, have to do with the field of study itself. Some scholars even question the intentions of those developing the field of study, claiming that efforts to \"develop\" the Global South were never about the South itself. Instead, these efforts, it is argued, were made in order to advance Western development and reinforce Western hegemony.\nTies to media effects studies.\nThe core of cultural imperialism thesis is integrated with the political-economy traditional approach in media effects research. Critics of cultural imperialism commonly claim that non-Western cultures, particularly from the Third World, will forsake their traditional values and lose their cultural identities when they are solely exposed to Western media. Nonetheless, Michael B. Salwen, in his book \"Critical Studies in Mass Communication\" (1991), claims that cross-consideration and integration of empirical findings on cultural imperialist influences is very critical in terms of understanding mass media in the international sphere. He recognises both of contradictory contexts on cultural imperialist impacts. \nThe first context is where cultural imperialism imposes socio-political disruptions on developing nations. Western media can distort images of foreign cultures and provoke personal and social conflicts to developing nations in some cases. \nAnother context is that peoples in developing nations resist to foreign media and preserve their cultural attitudes. Although he admits that outward manifestations of Western culture may be adopted, but the fundamental values and behaviours remain still. Furthermore, positive effects might occur when male-dominated cultures adopt the \"liberation\" of women with exposure to Western media and it stimulates ample exchange of cultural exchange.\nCriticisms of \"cultural imperialism theory\".\nCritics of scholars who discuss cultural imperialism have a number of critiques. \"Cultural imperialism\" is a term that is only used in discussions where cultural relativism and constructivism are generally taken as true. (One cannot critique promoting Western values if one believes that said values are absolutely correct. Similarly, one cannot argue that Western epistemology is unjustly promoted in non-Western societies if one believes that those epistemologies are absolutely correct.) Therefore, those who disagree with cultural relativism and/or constructivism may critique the employment of the term, \"cultural imperialism\" on those terms.\nJohn Tomlinson provides a critique of cultural imperialism theory and reveals major problems in the way in which the idea of cultural, as opposed to economic or political, imperialism is formulated. In his book \"Cultural Imperialism: A Critical Introduction\", he delves into the much debated \"media imperialism\" theory. Summarizing research on the Third World's reception of American television shows, he challenges the cultural imperialism argument, conveying his doubts about the degree to which US shows in developing nations actually carry US values and improve the profits of US companies. Tomlinson suggests that cultural imperialism is growing in some respects, but local transformation and interpretations of imported media products propose that cultural diversification is not at an end in global society. He explains that one of the fundamental conceptual mistakes of cultural imperialism is to take for granted that the distribution of cultural goods can be considered as cultural dominance. He thus supports his argument highly criticising the concept that Americanization is occurring through global overflow of American television products. He points to a myriad of examples of television networks who have managed to dominate their domestic markets and that domestic programs generally top the ratings. He also doubts the concept that cultural agents are passive receivers of information. He states that movement between cultural/geographical areas always involves translation, mutation, adaptation, and the creation of hybridity.\nOther key critiques are that the term is not defined well, and employs further terms that are not defined well, and therefore lacks explanatory power, that \"cultural imperialism\" is hard to measure, and that the theory of a legacy of colonialism is not always true.\nRothkopf on dealing with cultural dominance.\nDavid Rothkopf, managing director of Kissinger Associates and an adjunct professor of international affairs at Columbia University (who also served as a senior U.S. Commerce Department official in the Clinton Administration), wrote about cultural imperialism in his provocatively titled \"In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?\" in the summer 1997 issue of \"Foreign Policy\" magazine. Rothkopf says that the United States should embrace \"cultural imperialism\" as in its self-interest. But his definition of cultural imperialism stresses spreading the values of tolerance and openness to cultural change in order to avoid war and conflict between cultures as well as expanding accepted technological and legal standards to provide free traders with enough security to do business with more countries. Rothkopf's definition almost exclusively involves allowing individuals in other nations to accept or reject foreign cultural influences. He also mentions, but only in passing, the use of the English language and consumption of news and popular music and film as cultural dominance that he supports. Rothkopf additionally makes the point that globalisation and the Internet are accelerating the process of cultural influence.\nCulture is sometimes used by the organisers of society\u2014politicians, theologians, academics, and families\u2014to impose and ensure order, the rudiments of which change over time as need dictates. One need only look at the 20th century's genocides. In each one, leaders used culture as a political front to fuel the passions of their armies and other minions and to justify their actions among their people.\nRothkopf then cites genocide and s in Armenia, Russia, the Holocaust, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda and East Timor as examples of culture (in some cases expressed in the ideology of \"political culture\" or religion) being misused to justify violence. He also acknowledges that cultural imperialism in the past has been guilty of forcefully eliminating the cultures of natives in the Americas and in Africa, or through use of the Inquisition, \"and during the expansion of virtually every empire.\".The most important way to deal with cultural influence in any nation, according to Rothkopf, is to promote tolerance and allow, or even promote, cultural diversities that are compatible with tolerance and to eliminate those cultural differences that cause violent conflict:\nCultural dominance can also be seen in the 1930s in Australia where the Aboriginal Assimilation Policy acted as an attempt to wipe out the Native Australian people. The British settlers tried to biologically alter the skin colour of the Australian Aboriginal people through mixed breeding with white people. The policy also made attempts to forcefully conform the Aborigines to western ideas of dress and education.\nIn history.\nAlthough the term was popularised in the 1960s, and was used by its original proponents to refer to cultural hegemonies in a post-colonial world, cultural imperialism has also been used to refer to times further in the past.\nAncient Greece.\nThe Ancient Greeks are known for spreading their culture around the Mediterranean and Near East through trade and conquest. During the Archaic Period, the burgeoning Greek city-states established settlements and colonies across the Mediterranean Sea, especially in Sicily and southern Italy, influencing the Etruscan and Roman peoples of the region. In the late fourth century BC, Alexander the Great conquered Persian and Indian territories all the way to the Indus River Valley and Punjab, spreading Greek pagan religion, art, and science along the way. This resulted in the rise of Hellenistic kingdoms and cities across Egypt, the Near East, Central Asia, and Northwest India where Greek culture fused with the cultures of the indigenous peoples. The Greek influence prevailed even longer in science and literature, where medieval Muslim scholars in the Middle East studied the writings of Aristotle for scientific learning.\nAncient Rome.\nThe Roman Empire was also an early example of cultural imperialism.\nEarly Rome, in its conquest of Italy, assimilated the people of Etruria by replacing the Etruscan language with Latin, which led to the demise of that language and many aspects of Etruscan civilisation.\nCultural Romanization was imposed on many parts of Rome's empire by \"many regions receiving Roman culture unwillingly, as a form of cultural imperialism.\" For example, when Greece was conquered by the Roman armies, Rome set about altering the culture of Greece to conform with Roman ideals. For instance, the Greek habit of stripping naked, in public, for exercise, was looked on askance by Roman writers, who considered the practice to be a cause of the Greeks' effeminacy and enslavement. The Roman example has been linked to modern instances of European imperialism in African countries, bridging the two instances with Slavoj Zizek's discussions of 'empty signifiers'.\nThe Pax Romana was secured in the empire, in part, by the \"forced acculturation of the culturally diverse populations that Rome had conquered.\"\nBritish Empire.\nBritish worldwide expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries was an economic and political phenomenon. However, \"there was also a strong social and cultural dimension to it, which Rudyard Kipling termed the 'white man's burden'.\" One of the ways this was carried out was by religious proselytising, by, amongst others, the London Missionary Society, which was \"an agent of British cultural imperialism.\" Another way, was by the imposition of educational material on the colonies for an \"imperial curriculum\". Robin A. Butlin writes, \"The promotion of empire through books, illustrative materials, and educational syllabuses was widespread, part of an education policy geared to cultural imperialism\". This was also true of science and technology in the empire. Douglas M. Peers and Nandini Gooptu note that \"Most scholars of colonial science in India now prefer to stress the ways in which science and technology worked in the service of colonialism, as both a 'tool of empire' in the practical sense and as a vehicle for cultural imperialism. In other words, science developed in India in ways that reflected colonial priorities, tending to benefit Europeans at the expense of Indians, while remaining dependent on and subservient to scientific authorities in the colonial metropolis.\"\nThe analysis of cultural imperialism carried out by Edward Said drew principally from a study of the British Empire. According to Danilo Raponi, the cultural imperialism of the British in the 19th century had a much wider effect than only in the British Empire. He writes, \"To paraphrase Said, I see cultural imperialism as a complex cultural hegemony of a country, Great Britain, that in the 19th century had no rivals in terms of its ability to project its power across the world and to influence the cultural, political and commercial affairs of most countries. It is the 'cultural hegemony' of a country whose power to export the most fundamental ideas and concepts at the basis of its understanding of 'civilisation' knew practically no bounds.\" In this, for example, Raponi includes Italy.\nOther pre-Second World War examples.\nThe New Cambridge Modern History writes about the cultural imperialism of Napoleonic France. Napoleon used the Institut de France \"as an instrument for transmuting French universalism into cultural imperialism.\" Members of the Institute (who included Napoleon), descended upon Egypt in 1798. \"Upon arrival they organised themselves into an Institute of Cairo. The Rosetta Stone is their most famous find. The science of Egyptology is their legacy.\"\nAfter the First World War, Germans were worried about the extent of French influence in the annexed Rhineland, with the French occupation of the Ruhr Valley in 1923. An early use of the term appeared in an essay by Paul Ruhlmann (as \"Peter Hartmann\") at that date, entitled \"French Cultural Imperialism on the Rhine\".\nTies to North American Colonisation.\nKeeping in line with the trends of international imperialistic endeavours, the expansion of Canadian and American territory in the 19th century saw cultural imperialism employed as a means of control over indigenous populations. This, when used in conjunction of more traditional forms of ethnic cleansing and genocide in the United States, saw devastating, lasting effects on indigenous communities.\nIn 2017 Canada celebrated its 150-year anniversary of the confederating of three British colonies. As Catherine Murton Stoehr points out in \"Origins\", a publication organised by the history departments of Ohio State University and Miami University, the occasion came with remembrance of Canada's treatment of First Nations people.\nNumerous policies focused on indigenous persons came into effect shortly thereafter. Most notable is the use of residential schools across Canada as a means to remove indigenous persons from their culture and instill in them the beliefs and values of the majorised colonial hegemony. The policies of these schools, as described by Ward Churchill in his book \"Kill the Indian, Save the Man\", were to forcefully assimilate students who were often removed with force from their families. These schools forbid students from using their native languages and participating in their own cultural practices.\nResidential schools were largely run by Christian churches, operating in conjunction with Christian missions with minimal government oversight.\nThe book, \"Stolen Lives: The Indigenous peoples of Canada and the Indian Residentials Schools\", describes this form of operation:\nIn a \"The New York Times\" op-ed, Gabrielle Scrimshaw describes her grandparents being forced to send her mother to one of these schools or risk imprisonment. After hiding her mother on \"school pick up day\" so as to avoid sending their daughter to institutions whose abuse was well known at the time (mid-20th century). Scrimshaw's mother was left with limited options for further education she says and is today illiterate as a result.\nScrimshaw explains \"Seven generations of my ancestors went through these schools. Each new family member enrolled meant a compounding of abuse and a steady loss of identity, culture and hope. My mother was the last generation. the experience left her broken, and like so many, she turned to substances to numb these pains.\"\nA report, republished by CBC News, estimates nearly 6,000 children died in the care of these schools.\nThe colonisation of native peoples in North America remains active today despite the closing of the majority of residential schools. This form of cultural imperialism continues in the use of Native Americans as mascots for schools and athletic teams. Jason Edward Black, a professor and chair in the Department of Communication Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, describes how the use of Native Americans as mascots furthers the colonial attitudes of the 18th and 19th centuries.\nIn \"Deciphering Pocahontas\", Kent Ono and Derek Buescher wrote: \"Euro-American culture has made a habit of appropriating, and redefining what is 'distinctive' and constitutive of Native Americans.\"\nNazi colonialism.\n\"Cultural imperialism\" has also been used in connection with the expansion of German influence under the Nazis in the middle of the twentieth century. Alan Steinweis and Daniel Rogers note that even before the Nazis came to power, \"Already in the Weimar Republic, German academic specialists on eastern Europe had contributed through their publications and teaching to the legitimization of German territorial revanchism and cultural imperialism. These scholars operated primarily in the disciplines of history, economics, geography, and literature.\"\nIn the area of music, Michael Kater writes that during the WWII German occupation of France, Hans Rosbaud, a German conductor based by the Nazi regime in Strasbourg, became \"at least nominally, a servant of Nazi cultural imperialism directed against the French.\"\nIn Italy during the war, Germany pursued \"a European cultural front that gravitates around German culture\". The Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels set up the European Union of Writers, \"one of Goebbels's most ambitious projects for Nazi cultural hegemony. Presumably a means of gathering authors from Germany, Italy, and the occupied countries to plan the literary life of the new Europe, the union soon emerged as a vehicle of German cultural imperialism.\"\nFor other parts of Europe, Robert Gerwarth, writing about cultural imperialism and Reinhard Heydrich, states that the \"Nazis' Germanization project was based on a historically unprecedented programme of racial stock-taking, theft, expulsion and murder.\" Also, \"The full integration of the [Czech] Protectorate into this New Order required the complete Germanization of the Protectorate's cultural life and the eradication of indigenous Czech and Jewish culture.\"\nThe actions by Nazi Germany reflect on the notion of race and culture playing a significant role in imperialism. The idea that there is a distinction between the Germans and the Jews has created the illusion of Germans believing they were superior to the Jewish inferiors, the notion of us/them and self/others.\nAmericanization.\nThe terms \"McDonaldization\", \"Disneyization\" and \"Cocacolonization\" have been coined to describe the spread of Western cultural influence. \nThere are many countries affected by the US and their pop-culture. For example, the film industry in Nigeria referred to as \"Nollywood\" being the second largest as it produces more films annually than the United States, their films are shown across Africa. Another term that describes the spread of Western cultural influence is it is when American culture is promoted through Hollywood films which can culturally affect the viewers of Hollywood films. "}

{"id": "6271", "revid": "40613867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6271", "title": "Chemical reaction", "text": "A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur.\nThe substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which symbolically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.\nChemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration. Typically, reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms.\nReactions may proceed in the forward or reverse direction until they go to completion or reach equilibrium. Reactions that proceed in the forward direction to approach equilibrium are often described as spontaneous, requiring no input of free energy to go forward. Non-spontaneous reactions require input of free energy to go forward (examples include charging a battery by applying an external electrical power source, or photosynthesis driven by absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the form of sunlight).\nA reaction may be classified as redox in which oxidation and reduction occur or nonredox in which there is no oxidation and reduction occurring. Most simple redox reactions may be classified as combination, decomposition, or single displacement reactions.\nDifferent chemical reactions are used during chemical synthesis in order to obtain a desired product. In biochemistry, a consecutive series of chemical reactions (where the product of one reaction is the reactant of the next reaction) form metabolic pathways. These reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes. Enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions, so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions can occur at the temperatures and concentrations present within a cell.\nThe general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to reactions between entities smaller than atoms, including nuclear reactions, radioactive decays, and reactions between elementary particles, as described by quantum field theory.\nHistory.\nChemical reactions such as combustion in fire, fermentation and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity. Initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by Greek philosophers, such as the Four-Element Theory of Empedocles stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements \u2013 fire, water, air and earth. In the Middle Ages, chemical transformations were studied by alchemists. They attempted, in particular, to convert lead into gold, for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead-copper alloys with sulfur.\nThe artificial production of chemical substances already was a central goal for medieval alchemists. Examples include the synthesis of ammonium chloride from organic substances as described in the works (c. 850\u2013950) attributed to J\u0101bir ibn \u1e24ayy\u0101n, or the production of mineral acids such as sulfuric and nitric acids by later alchemists, starting from c. 1300. The production of mineral acids involved the heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as copper sulfate, alum and saltpeter. In the 17th century, Johann Rudolph Glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate by reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride. With the development of the lead chamber process in 1746 and the Leblanc process, allowing large-scale production of sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate, respectively, chemical reactions became implemented into the industry. Further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the contact process in the 1880s, and the Haber process was developed in 1909\u20131910 for ammonia synthesis.\nFrom the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations. The phlogiston theory was proposed in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher. It postulated the existence of a fire-like element called \"phlogiston\", which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. This proved to be false in 1785 by Antoine Lavoisier who found the correct explanation of the combustion as reaction with oxygen from the air.\nJoseph Louis Gay-Lussac recognized in 1808 that gases always react in a certain relationship with each other. Based on this idea and the atomic theory of John Dalton, Joseph Proust had developed the law of definite proportions, which later resulted in the concepts of stoichiometry and chemical equations.\nRegarding the organic chemistry, it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained synthetically. According to the concept of vitalism, organic matter was endowed with a \"vital force\" and distinguished from inorganic materials. This separation was ended however by the synthesis of urea from inorganic precursors by Friedrich W\u00f6hler in 1828. Other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include Alexander William Williamson with his synthesis of ethers and Christopher Kelk Ingold, who, among many discoveries, established the mechanisms of substitution reactions.\nCharacteristics.\nThe general characteristics of chemical reactions are:\nEquations.\nChemical equations are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions. They consist of chemical or structural formulas of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right. They are separated by an arrow (\u2192) which indicates the direction and type of the reaction; the arrow is read as the word \"yields\". The tip of the arrow points in the direction in which the reaction proceeds. A double arrow () pointing in opposite directions is used for equilibrium reactions. Equations should be balanced according to the stoichiometry, the number of atoms of each species should be the same on both sides of the equation. This is achieved by scaling the number of involved molecules (&lt;chem&gt;A, B, C&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;D&lt;/chem&gt; in a schematic example below) by the appropriate integers \"a, b, c\" and \"d\".\nMore elaborate reactions are represented by reaction schemes, which in addition to starting materials and products show important intermediates or transition states. Also, some relatively minor additions to the reaction can be indicated above the reaction arrow; examples of such additions are water, heat, illumination, a catalyst, etc. Similarly, some minor products can be placed below the arrow, often with a minus sign.\nRetrosynthetic analysis can be applied to design a complex synthesis reaction. Here the analysis starts from the products, for example by splitting selected chemical bonds, to arrive at plausible initial reagents. A special arrow (\u21d2) is used in retro reactions.\nElementary reactions.\nThe elementary reaction is the smallest division into which a chemical reaction can be decomposed, it has no intermediate products. Most experimentally observed reactions are built up from many elementary reactions that occur in parallel or sequentially. The actual sequence of the individual elementary reactions is known as reaction mechanism. An elementary reaction involves a few molecules, usually one or two, because of the low probability for several molecules to meet at a certain time.\nThe most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction; it is transformed by an isomerization or a dissociation into one or more other molecules. Such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cis\u2013trans isomerization, in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa.\nIn a typical dissociation reaction, a bond in a molecule splits (ruptures) resulting in two molecular fragments. The splitting can be homolytic or heterolytic. In the first case, the bond is divided so that each product retains an electron and becomes a neutral radical. In the second case, both electrons of the chemical bond remain with one of the products, resulting in charged ions. Dissociation plays an important role in triggering chain reactions, such as hydrogen\u2013oxygen or polymerization reactions.\nFor bimolecular reactions, two molecules collide and react with each other. Their merger is called chemical synthesis or an addition reaction.\nAnother possibility is that only a portion of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule. This type of reaction occurs, for example, in redox and acid-base reactions. In redox reactions, the transferred particle is an electron, whereas in acid-base reactions it is a proton. This type of reaction is also called metathesis.\nfor example\nChemical equilibrium.\nMost chemical reactions are reversible; that is, they can and do run in both directions. The forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier's principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas.\nThe reaction yield stabilizes at equilibrium, but can be increased by removing the product from the reaction mixture or changed by increasing the temperature or pressure. A change in the concentrations of the reactants does not affect the equilibrium constant, but does affect the equilibrium position.\nThermodynamics.\nChemical reactions are determined by the laws of thermodynamics. Reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic, that is if they release energy. The associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities, enthalpy and entropy:\nReactions can be exothermic, where \u0394H is negative and energy is released. Typical examples of exothermic reactions are precipitation and crystallization, in which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous or liquid phases. In contrast, in endothermic reactions, heat is consumed from the environment. This can occur by increasing the entropy of the system, often through the formation of gaseous reaction products, which have high entropy. Since the entropy increases with temperature, many endothermic reactions preferably take place at high temperatures. On the contrary, many exothermic reactions such as crystallization occur at low temperatures. Changes in temperature can sometimes reverse the sign of the enthalpy of a reaction, as for the carbon monoxide reduction of molybdenum dioxide:\nThis reaction to form carbon dioxide and molybdenum is endothermic at low temperatures, becoming less so with increasing temperature. \u0394H\u00b0 is zero at , and the reaction becomes exothermic above that temperature.\nChanges in temperature can also reverse the direction tendency of a reaction. For example, the water gas shift reaction\nis favored by low temperatures, but its reverse is favored by high temperature. The shift in reaction direction tendency occurs at .\nReactions can also be characterized by the internal energy which takes into account changes in the entropy, volume and chemical potential. The latter depends, among other things, on the activities of the involved substances.\nKinetics.\nThe speed at which reactions takes place is studied by reaction kinetics. The rate depends on various parameters, such as:\nSeveral theories allow calculating the reaction rates at the molecular level. This field is referred to as reaction dynamics. The rate \"v\" of a first-order reaction, which could be disintegration of a substance A, is given by:\nIts integration yields:\nHere k is first-order rate constant having dimension 1/time, [A](t) is concentration at a time \"t\" and [A]0 is the initial concentration. The rate of a first-order reaction depends only on the concentration and the properties of the involved substance, and the reaction itself can be described with the characteristic half-life. More than one time constant is needed when describing reactions of higher order. The temperature dependence of the rate constant usually follows the Arrhenius equation:\nwhere Ea is the activation energy and kB is the Boltzmann constant. One of the simplest models of reaction rate is the collision theory. More realistic models are tailored to a specific problem and include the transition state theory, the calculation of the potential energy surface, the Marcus theory and the Rice\u2013Ramsperger\u2013Kassel\u2013Marcus (RRKM) theory.\nReaction types.\nFour basic types.\nSynthesis.\nIn a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance. These reactions are in the general form:\nTwo or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction. One example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of iron and sulfur to form iron(II) sulfide:\nAnother example is simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas to produce a more complex substance, such as water.\nDecomposition.\nA decomposition reaction is when a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts. It is thus the opposite of a synthesis reaction, and can be written as\nOne example of a decomposition reaction is the electrolysis of water to make oxygen and hydrogen gas:\nSingle replacement.\nIn a single replacement reaction, a single uncombined element replaces another in a compound; in other words, one element trades places with another element in a compound These reactions come in the general form of:\nOne example of a single displacement reaction is when magnesium replaces hydrogen in water to make magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas:\nDouble replacement.\nIn a double replacement reaction, the anions and cations of two compounds switch places and form two entirely different compounds. These reactions are in the general form:\nFor example, when barium chloride (BaCl2) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) react, the SO42\u2212 anion switches places with the 2Cl\u2212 anion, giving the compounds BaSO4 and MgCl2.\nAnother example of a double displacement reaction is the reaction of lead(II) nitrate with potassium iodide to form lead(II) iodide and potassium nitrate:\nCombustion.\nIn a combustion reaction, an element or compound reacts with oxygen, often producing energy in the form of heat or light. Combustion reactions always involve oxygen, but also frequently involve a hydrocarbon.\nA combustion reaction can also result from carbon, magnesium or sulfur reacting with oxygen.\nOxidation and reduction.\nRedox reactions can be understood in terms of transfer of electrons from one involved species (reducing agent) to another (oxidizing agent). In this process, the former species is \"oxidized\" and the latter is \"reduced\". Though sufficient for many purposes, these descriptions are not precisely correct. Oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation state, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation state. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation state, but there are many reactions that are classed as \"redox\" even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving covalent bonds).\nIn the following redox reaction, hazardous sodium metal reacts with toxic chlorine gas to form the ionic compound sodium chloride, or common table salt:\nIn the reaction, sodium metal goes from an oxidation state of 0 (as it is a pure element) to +1: in other words, the sodium lost one electron and is said to have been oxidized. On the other hand, the chlorine gas goes from an oxidation of 0 (it is also a pure element) to \u22121: the chlorine gains one electron and is said to have been reduced. Because the chlorine is the one reduced, it is considered the electron acceptor, or in other words, induces oxidation in the sodium \u2013 thus the chlorine gas is considered the oxidizing agent. Conversely, the sodium is oxidized or is the electron donor, and thus induces reduction in the other species and is considered the \"reducing agent\".\nWhich of the involved reactants would be reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the electronegativity of their elements. Elements with low electronegativity, such as most metals, easily donate electrons and oxidize \u2013 they are reducing agents. On the contrary, many ions with high oxidation numbers, such as , , , , can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents.\nThe number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from the electron configuration of the reactant element. Elements try to reach the low-energy noble gas configuration, and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron respectively. Noble gases themselves are chemically inactive.\nAn important class of redox reactions are the electrochemical reactions, where electrons from the power supply are used as the reducing agent. These reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements, such as chlorine or aluminium. The reverse process in which electrons are released in redox reactions and can be used as electrical energy is possible and used in batteries.\nComplexation.\nIn complexation reactions, several ligands react with a metal atom to form a coordination complex. This is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds. The ligands are Lewis bases, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the 18-electron rule, saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate 18 electrons, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory. Complexation reactions also include ligand exchange, in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom.\nAcid-base reactions.\nIn the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory, an acid-base reaction involves a transfer of protons (H+) from one species (the acid) to another (the base). When a proton is removed from an acid, the resulting species is termed that acid's conjugate base. When the proton is accepted by a base, the resulting species is termed that base's conjugate acid. In other words, acids act as proton donors and bases act as proton acceptors according to the following equation:\nThe reverse reaction is possible, and thus the acid/base and conjugated base/acid are always in equilibrium. The equilibrium is determined by the acid and base dissociation constants (\"K\"a and \"K\"b) of the involved substances. A special case of the acid-base reaction is the neutralization where an acid and a base, taken at exactly same amounts, form a neutral salt.\nAcid-base reactions can have different definitions depending on the acid-base concept employed. Some of the most common are:\nPrecipitation.\nPrecipitation is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals. The latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from microcrystalline salts.\nSolid-state reactions.\nReactions can take place between two solids. However, because of the relatively small diffusion rates in solids, the corresponding chemical reactions are very slow in comparison to liquid and gas phase reactions. They are accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature and finely dividing the reactant to increase the contacting surface area.\nReactions at the solid|gas interface.\nReaction can take place at the solid|gas interface, surfaces at very low pressure such as ultra-high vacuum. Via scanning tunneling microscopy, it is possible to observe reactions at the solid|gas interface in real space, if the time scale of the reaction is in the correct range. Reactions at the solid|gas interface are in some cases related to catalysis.\nPhotochemical reactions.\nIn photochemical reactions, atoms and molecules absorb energy (photons) of the illumination light and convert into an excited state. They can then release this energy by breaking chemical bonds, thereby producing radicals. Photochemical reactions include hydrogen\u2013oxygen reactions, radical polymerization, chain reactions and rearrangement reactions.\nMany important processes involve photochemistry. The premier example is photosynthesis, in which most plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, disposing of oxygen as a side-product. Humans rely on photochemistry for the formation of vitamin D, and vision is initiated by a photochemical reaction of rhodopsin. In fireflies, an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence. Many significant photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, occur in the Earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry.\nCatalysis.\nIn catalysis, the reaction does not proceed directly, but through reaction with a third substance known as catalyst. Although the catalyst takes part in the reaction, it is returned to its original state by the end of the reaction and so is not consumed. However, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase (heterogeneous) or in the same phase (homogeneous) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid\u2013liquid system or evaporate in a solid\u2013gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction \u2013 chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy.\nHeterogeneous catalysts are usually solids, powdered in order to maximize their surface area. Of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition metals, which are used in hydrogenations, catalytic reforming and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as nitric acid and ammonia. Acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst, they increase the nucleophilicity of carbonyls, allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles. The advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants, but they may also be difficult to separate from the products. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes.\nReactions in organic chemistry.\nIn organic chemistry, in addition to oxidation, reduction or acid-base reactions, a number of other reactions can take place which involve covalent bonds between carbon atoms or carbon and heteroatoms (such as oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, etc.). Many specific reactions in organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their discoverers.\nSubstitution.\nIn a substitution reaction, a functional group in a particular chemical compound is replaced by another group. These reactions can be distinguished by the type of substituting species into a nucleophilic, electrophilic or radical substitution.\nIn the first type, a nucleophile, an atom or molecule with an excess of electrons and thus a negative charge or partial charge, replaces another atom or part of the \"substrate\" molecule. The electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond, while the leaving group departs with an electron pair. The nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged, whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged. Examples of nucleophiles are hydroxide ion, alkoxides, amines and halides. This type of reaction is found mainly in aliphatic hydrocarbons, and rarely in aromatic hydrocarbon. The latter have high electron density and enter nucleophilic aromatic substitution only with very strong electron withdrawing groups. Nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms, SN1 and SN2. In their names, S stands for substitution, N for nucleophilic, and the number represents the kinetic order of the reaction, unimolecular or bimolecular.\nThe SN1 reaction proceeds in two steps. First, the leaving group is eliminated creating a carbocation. This is followed by a rapid reaction with the nucleophile.\nIn the SN2 mechanism, the nucleophile forms a transition state with the attacked molecule, and only then the leaving group is cleaved. These two mechanisms differ in the stereochemistry of the products. SN1 leads to the non-stereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center, but rather in a set of geometric isomers (\"cis/trans\"). In contrast, a reversal (Walden inversion) of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the SN2 mechanism.\nElectrophilic substitution is the counterpart of the nucleophilic substitution in that the attacking atom or molecule, an electrophile, has low electron density and thus a positive charge. Typical electrophiles are the carbon atom of carbonyl groups, carbocations or sulfur or nitronium cations. This reaction takes place almost exclusively in aromatic hydrocarbons, where it is called electrophilic aromatic substitution. The electrophile attack results in the so-called \u03c3-complex, a transition state in which the aromatic system is abolished. Then, the leaving group, usually a proton, is split off and the aromaticity is restored. An alternative to aromatic substitution is electrophilic aliphatic substitution. It is similar to the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major types, SE1 and SE2\nIn the third type of substitution reaction, radical substitution, the attacking particle is a radical. This process usually takes the form of a chain reaction, for example in the reaction of alkanes with halogens. In the first step, light or heat disintegrates the halogen-containing molecules producing the radicals. Then the reaction proceeds as an avalanche until two radicals meet and recombine.\nAddition and elimination.\nThe addition and its counterpart, the elimination, are reactions which change the number of substituents on the carbon atom, and form or cleave multiple bonds. Double and triple bonds can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group. Similar to the nucleophilic substitution, there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order. In the E1 mechanism, the leaving group is ejected first, forming a carbocation. The next step, formation of the double bond, takes place with elimination of a proton (deprotonation). The leaving order is reversed in the E1cb mechanism, that is the proton is split off first. This mechanism requires participation of a base. Because of the similar conditions, both reactions in the E1 or E1cb elimination always compete with the SN1 substitution.\nThe E2 mechanism also requires a base, but there the attack of the base and the elimination of the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate. In contrast to the E1 eliminations, different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the E2 mechanism, because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti-position with respect to the leaving group. Because of the similar conditions and reagents, the E2 elimination is always in competition with the SN2-substitution.\nThe counterpart of elimination is the addition where double or triple bonds are converted into single bonds. Similar to the substitution reactions, there are several types of additions distinguished by the type of the attacking particle. For example, in the electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide, an electrophile (proton) attacks the double bond forming a carbocation, which then reacts with the nucleophile (bromine). The carbocation can be formed on either side of the double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends, and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the Markovnikov's rule. This rule states that \"In the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne, the more electronegative (nucleophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms.\"\nIf the addition of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond, then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible. In this case, one has to use the hydroboration\u2013oxidation reaction, where in the first step, the boron atom acts as electrophile and adds to the less substituted carbon atom. At the second step, the nucleophilic hydroperoxide or halogen anion attacks the boron atom.\nWhile the addition to the electron-rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic, the nucleophilic addition plays an important role for the carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds, and especially its most important representative, the carbonyl group. This process is often associated with an elimination, so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again. It is therefore called addition-elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides, esters or anhydrides. This reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases, where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom, whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile.\nNucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to the double bond of an alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl compound can proceed via the Michael reaction, which belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions. This is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of C\u2013C bonds.\nSome additions which can not be executed with nucleophiles and electrophiles, can be succeeded with free radicals. As with the free-radical substitution, the radical addition proceeds as a chain reaction, and such reactions are the basis of the free-radical polymerization.\nOther organic reaction mechanisms.\nIn a rearrangement reaction, the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule. These include hydride shift reactions such as the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, where a hydrogen, alkyl or aryl group migrates from one carbon to a neighboring carbon. Most rearrangements are associated with the breaking and formation of new carbon-carbon bonds. Other examples are sigmatropic reaction such as the Cope rearrangement.\nCyclic rearrangements include cycloadditions and, more generally, pericyclic reactions, wherein two or more double bond-containing molecules form a cyclic molecule. An important example of cycloaddition reaction is the Diels\u2013Alder reaction (the so-called [4+2] cycloaddition) between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene to form a substituted cyclohexene system.\nWhether a certain cycloaddition would proceed depends on the electronic orbitals of the participating species, as only orbitals with the same sign of wave function will overlap and interact constructively to form new bonds. Cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat. These perturbations result in different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects. For example, the [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the [2+2] cycloaddition is selectively induced by light. Because of the orbital character, the potential for developing stereoisomeric products upon cycloaddition is limited, as described by the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules.\nBiochemical reactions.\nBiochemical reactions are mainly controlled by enzymes. These proteins can specifically catalyze a single reaction, so that reactions can be controlled very precisely. The reaction takes place in the active site, a small part of the enzyme which is usually found in a cleft or pocket lined by amino acid residues, and the rest of the enzyme is used mainly for stabilization. The catalytic action of enzymes relies on several mechanisms including the molecular shape (\"induced fit\"), bond strain, proximity and orientation of molecules relative to the enzyme, proton donation or withdrawal (acid/base catalysis), electrostatic interactions and many others.\nThe biochemical reactions that occur in living organisms are collectively known as metabolism. Among the most important of its mechanisms is the anabolism, in which different DNA and enzyme-controlled processes result in the production of large molecules such as proteins and carbohydrates from smaller units. Bioenergetics studies the sources of energy for such reactions. An important energy source is glucose, which can be produced by plants via photosynthesis or assimilated from food. All organisms use this energy to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which can then be used to energize other reactions.\nApplications.\nChemical reactions are central to chemical engineering where they are used for the synthesis of new compounds from natural raw materials such as petroleum and mineral ores. It is essential to make the reaction as efficient as possible, maximizing the yield and minimizing the amount of reagents, energy inputs and waste. Catalysts are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its reaction rate.\nSome specific reactions have their niche applications. For example, the thermite reaction is used to generate light and heat in pyrotechnics and welding. Although it is less controllable than the more conventional oxy-fuel welding, arc welding and flash welding, it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails, especially in remote areas.\nMonitoring.\nMechanisms of monitoring chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate. Relatively slow processes can be analyzed in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients. Important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of pH and analysis of optical absorption (color) and emission spectra. A less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to; this method is often used to analyze redistribution of substances in the human body. Faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast laser spectroscopy where utilization of femtosecond lasers allows short-lived transition states to be monitored at time scaled down to a few femtoseconds."}

{"id": "6276", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6276", "title": "Casiquiare canal", "text": "The Casiquiare river () is a distributary of the upper Orinoco flowing southward into the Rio Negro, in Venezuela, South America. As such, it forms a unique natural canal between the Orinoco and Amazon river systems. It is the world's largest river of the kind that links two major river systems, a so-called bifurcation. The area forms a water divide, more dramatically at regional flood stage.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1744 a Jesuit priest named Father Roman, while ascending the Orinoco River, met some Portuguese slave-traders from the settlements on the Rio Negro. He accompanied them on their return, by way of the Casiquiare canal, and afterwards retraced his route to the Orinoco. Charles Marie de La Condamine, seven months later, was able to give to the \"Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\" an account of Father Roman's voyage, and thus confirm the existence of this waterway, first reported by Father Acu\u00f1a in 1639.\nLittle credence was given to Father Roman's statement until it was verified, in 1756, by the Spanish Boundary-line Commission of Jos\u00e9 Yturriaga and Solano. In 1800 German scientist Alexander von Humboldt and French botanist Aim\u00e9 Bonpland explored the river. During a 1924\u201325 expedition, Alexander H. Rice, Jr. of Harvard University traveled up the Orinoco, traversed the Casiquiare canal, and descended the Rio Negro to the Amazon at Manaus. It was the first expedition to use aerial photography and shortwave radio for mapping of the region. In 1968 the Casiquiare was navigated by an SRN6 hovercraft during a National Geographic expedition.\nGeography.\nThe origin of the Casiquiare, at the River Orinoco, is below the mission of La Esmeralda at , and about above sea level. Its mouth at the Rio Negro, an affluent of the Amazon River, is near the town of San Carlos and is above sea level.\nThe general course is south-west, and its length, including windings, is about . Its width, at its bifurcation with the Orinoco, is approximately , with a current towards the Rio Negro of . However, as it gains in volume from the very numerous tributary streams, large and small, that it receives en route, its velocity increases, and in the wet season reaches , even in certain stretches. It broadens considerably as it approaches its mouth, where it is about wide. The volume of water the Casiquiare captures from the Orinoco is small in comparison to what it accumulates in its course. Nevertheless, the geological processes are ongoing, and evidence points to a slow and gradual increase in the size of Casiquiare. It is likely that stream capture is in progress, i.e. what currently is the uppermost Orinoco basin, including Cunucunuma River, eventually will be entirely diverted by the Casiquiare into the Amazon basin.\nIn flood time, it is said to have a second connection with the Rio Negro by a branch, which it throws off to the westward, called the Itinivini, which leaves it at a point about above its mouth. In the dry season, it has shallows, and is obstructed by sandbanks, a few rapids and granite rocks. Its shores are densely wooded, and the soil more fertile than that along the Rio Negro. The general slope of the plains through which the canal runs is south-west, but those of the Rio Negro slope south-east.\nThe Casiquiare is not a sluggish canal on a flat tableland, but a great, rapid river which, if its upper waters had not found contact with the Orinoco, perhaps by cutting back, would belong entirely to the Negro branch of the Amazon.\nTo the west of the Casiquiare, there is a much shorter and easier portage between the Orinoco and Amazon basins, called the isthmus of Pimichin, which is reached by ascending the Temi branch of the Atabapo River, an affluent of the Orinoco. Although the Temi is somewhat obstructed, it is believed that it could easily be made navigable for small craft. The isthmus is across, with undulating ground, nowhere over high, with swamps and marshes. It is much used for the transit of large canoes, which are hauled across it from the Temi river, and which reach the Rio Negro by the little stream called the Pimichin.\nHydrographic divide.\nThe Casiquiare canal \u2013 Orinoco River hydrographic divide is a representation of the hydrographic water divide that delineates the separation between the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin. (The Orinoco Basin flows west\u2013north\u2013northeast into the Caribbean; the Amazon Basin flows east into the western Atlantic in the extreme northeast of Brazil.)\nEssentially the river divide is a west-flowing, upriver section of Venezuela's Orinoco River with an outflow to the south into the Amazon Basin. This named outflow is the Casiquiare canal, which, as it heads downstream (southerly), picks up speed and also accumulates water volume.\nThe greatest manifestation of the divide is during floods. During flood stage, the Casiquiare's main outflow point into the Rio Negro is supplemented by an overflow that is a second, and more minor, entry river bifurcation into the Rio Negro and upstream from its major, common low-water entry confluence with the Rio Negro. At flood, the river becomes an area flow source, far more than a narrow confined river.\nThe Casiquiare canal connects the upper Orinoco, below the mission of Esmeraldas, with the Rio Negro affluent of the Amazon River near the town of San Carlos.\nThe simplest description (besides the entire area-floodplain) of the water divide is a \"south-bank Orinoco River strip\" at the exit point of the Orinoco, also the origin of the Casiquiare canal. However, during the Orinoco's flood stage, that single, simply defined \"origin of the canal\" is turned into a region, and an entire strip along the southern bank of the Orinoco River."}

{"id": "6279", "revid": "494861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6279", "title": "Capetian dynasty", "text": "The Capetian dynasty (), also known as the House of France, is a dynasty of Frankish origin, and a branch of the Robertians. It is among the largest and oldest royal houses in Europe and the world, and consists of Hugh Capet, the founder of the dynasty, and his male-line descendants, who ruled in France without interruption from 987 to 1792, and again from 1814 to 1848. The senior line ruled in France as the House of Capet from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328. That line was succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and then Bourbon, which ruled without interruption until the French Revolution abolished the monarchy in 1792. The Bourbons were restored in 1814 in the aftermath of Napoleon's defeat, but had to vacate the throne again in 1830 in favor of the last Capetian monarch of France, Louis Philippe I, who belonged to the House of Orl\u00e9ans.\nThe dynasty had a crucial role in the formation of the French state. Initially obeyed only in their own demesne, the \u00cele-de-France, the Capetian kings slowly but steadily increased their power and influence until it grew to cover the entirety of their realm. For a detailed narration on the growth of French royal power, see \"Crown lands of France\".\nMembers of the dynasty were traditionally Catholic, and the early Capetians had an alliance with the Church. The French were also the most active participants in the Crusades, culminating in a series of five Crusader Kings \u2013 Louis VII, Philip Augustus, Louis VIII, Saint Louis, and Philip III. The Capetian alliance with the papacy suffered a severe blow after the disaster of the Aragonese Crusade. Philip III's son and successor, Philip IV, humiliated Pope Boniface VIII and brought the papacy under French control. The later Valois, starting with Francis I, ignored religious differences and allied with the Ottoman Sultan to counter the growing power of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry IV was a Protestant at the time of his accession, but realized the necessity of conversion after four years of religious warfare.\nThe Capetians generally enjoyed a harmonious family relationship. By tradition, younger sons and brothers of the King of France are given appanages for them to maintain their rank and to dissuade them from claiming the French crown itself. When Capetian cadets did aspire for kingship, their ambitions were directed not at the French throne, but at foreign thrones. As a result, the Capetians have reigned at different times in the kingdoms of Spain, Poland, Aragon, Portugal, Navarre, and as Emperors of the Latin Empire.\nIn modern times, King Felipe VI of Spain is a member of this family, while Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg is of relation to the family by agnatic kinship; both through the Bourbon branch of the dynasty. Along with the House of Habsburg, arguably its greatest historic rival, it was one of the two oldest European royal dynasties. It was also one of the most powerful royal families in European history, having played a pre-eminent role in its politics for much of its existence.\nName origins and usage.\nThe name of the dynasty derives from its founder, Hugh, who was known as \"Hugh Capet\". The meaning of \"Capet\" (a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort) is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with \"cape\", other suggestions suggest it to be connected to the Latin word \"caput\" (\"head\"), and explain it as meaning \"chief\" or \"head\".\nHistorians in the 19th century (see House of France) came to apply the name \"Capetian\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice. The name \"Capet\" has also been used as a surname for French royalty, particularly but not exclusively those of the House of Capet. One notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned King Louis XVI (a member of the House of Bourbon and a direct male-line descendant of Hugh Capet) and Queen Marie Antoinette (a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine) were referred to as \"Louis and Antoinette Capet\" (the queen being addressed as \"the Widow Capet\" after the execution of her husband).\nCapetian miracle.\nThe Capetian Miracle () refers to the dynasty's ability to attain and hold onto the French crown.\nIn 987, Hugh Capet was elected to succeed Louis V of the Carolingian dynasty that had ruled France for over three centuries. By a process of associating elder sons with them in the kingship, the early Capetians established the hereditary succession in their family and transformed a theoretically electoral kingship to a sacral one. By the time of Philip II Augustus, who became king in 1180, the Capetian hold on power was so strong that the practice of associate kingship was dropped. While the Capetian monarchy began as one of the weakest in Europe, drastically eclipsed by the new Anglo-Norman realm in England (who, as dukes of Normandy, were technically their vassals) and even other great lords of France, the political value of orderly succession in the Middle Ages cannot be overstated. The orderly succession of power from father to son over such a long period of time meant that the French monarchs, who originally were essentially just the direct rulers of the \u00cele-de-France, were able to preserve and extend their power, while over the course of centuries the great peers of the realm would eventually lose their power in one succession crisis or another.\nBy comparison, the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem was constantly beset with internal succession disputes because each generation only produced female heirs. Even the English monarchy encountered severe succession crises, such as The Anarchy of the 1120s between Stephen and Matilda, and the murder of Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, the primogeniture heir of Richard I of England. The latter case would deal a severe blow to the prestige of King John, leading to the eventual destruction of Angevin hegemony in France. In contrast, the French kings were able to maintain uncontested father-to-son succession from the time of Hugh Capet until the succession crisis which began the Hundred Years' War of the 14th century.\nThe Robertians and before.\nThe dynastic surname now used to describe Hugh Capet's family prior to his election as King of France is \"Robertians\" or \"Robertines.\" The name is derived from the family's first certain ancestor, Robert the Strong (b. 820), the count of Paris. Robert was probably son of Robert III of Worms (b. 800) and grandson of Robert of Hesbaye (b. 770). The Robertians probably originated in the county Hesbaye, around Tongeren in modern-day Belgium.\nThe sons of Robert the Strong were Odo and Robert, who both ruled as king of Western Francia. The family became Counts of Paris under Odo and Dukes of the Franks under Robert, possessing large parts of Neustria.\nThe Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of Louis V. After the death of Louis V, the son of Hugh the Great, Hugh Capet, was elected by the nobility as king of France. Hugh was crowned at Noyon on 3 July 987 with the full support from Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. With Hugh's coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named the \"Capetians,\" with the Capetian dynasty and its cadet branches such as the House of Valois ruling France for more than 800 years (987\u20131848, with some interruptions.\nCapetians through history.\nOver the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from kingdoms to manors.\nSalic law.\nSalic law, reestablished during the Hundred Years' War from an ancient Frankish tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male (agnatic) descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.\nWithout Salic law, upon the death of John I, the crown would have passed to his half-sister, Joan (later Joan II of Navarre). However, Joan's paternity was suspect due to her mother's adultery in the Tour de Nesle Affair; the French magnates adopted Salic law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.\nIn 1328, King Charles IV of France died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him. Philip of Valois, the late king's first cousin acted as regent, pending the birth of the king's posthumous child, which proved to be a girl. Isabella of France, sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, Edward III of England. The English king did not find support among the French lords, who made Philip of Valois their king. From then on the French succession not only excluded females, but also rejected claims based on the female line of descent.\nThus the French crown passed from the House of Capet after the death of Charles IV to Philip VI of France of the House of Valois, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty,\nThis did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain, Navarre, and various smaller duchies and counties. Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage. A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available below.\nCapetian cadet branches.\nThe Capetian Dynasty has been broken many times into (sometimes rival) cadet branches. A cadet branch is a line of descent from another line than the senior-most. This list of cadet branches shows most of the Capetian cadet lines and designating their royal French progenitor, although some sub-branches are not shown.\nSenior Capets.\nThroughout most of history, the Senior Capet and the King of France were synonymous terms. Only in the time before Hugh Capet took the crown for himself and after the reign of Charles X is there a distinction such that the senior Capet must be identified independently from succession to the French Crown. However, since primogeniture and the Salic law provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the Legitimist pretenders thereafter. All dates are for seniority, not reign.\nKing of France:\nLegitimist Pretenders:\nThe Capetian dynasty today.\nMany years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe; however, they still remain as kings, as well as other titles. Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven pretenders represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, senior family member is Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon, known by his supporters as Duke of Anjou, who also holds the Legitimist (\"Blancs d'Espagne\") claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.\nExcept for the House of Braganza (founded by an illegitimate son of King John I of Portugal, who was himself illegitimate), all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.\nCurrent numbers.\nIt is estimated that the agnatic (male line) descendants of the Capetian dynasty consists of 6,500 people (dead and alive).\nThe small number of agnatic descendants of the kings of France, compared with a theoretical number, is explained by the frequent marriages between Capetian cousins between the 12th and 20th centuries. Some examples of considerable inbreeding among descendants of the kings of France are:"}
{"id": "6280", "revid": "36942950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6280", "title": "Cuboctahedron", "text": "A cuboctahedron is a polyhedron with 8 triangular faces and 6 square faces. A cuboctahedron has 12 identical vertices, with 2 triangles and 2 squares meeting at each, and 24 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a square. As such, it is a quasiregular polyhedron, i.e. an Archimedean solid that is not only vertex-transitive but also edge-transitive. It is the only radially equilateral convex polyhedron.\nIts dual polyhedron is the rhombic dodecahedron.\nThe cuboctahedron was probably known to Plato: Heron's \"Definitiones\" quotes Archimedes as saying that Plato knew of a solid made of 8 triangles and 6 squares.\nArea and volume.\nThe area \"A\" and the volume \"V\" of the cuboctahedron of edge length \"a\" are:\nOrthogonal projections.\nThe \"cuboctahedron\" has four special orthogonal projections, centered on a vertex, an edge, and the two types of faces, triangular and square. The last two correspond to the B2 and A2 Coxeter planes. The skew projections show a square and hexagon passing through the center of the cuboctahedron.\nSpherical tiling.\nThe cuboctahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.\nCartesian coordinates.\nThe Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a cuboctahedron (of edge length ) centered at the origin are:\nAn alternate set of coordinates can be made in 4-space, as 12 permutations of:\nThis construction exists as one of 16 orthant facets of the cantellated 16-cell.\nRoot vectors.\nThe cuboctahedron's 12 vertices can represent the root vectors of the simple Lie group A3. With the addition of 6 vertices of the octahedron, these vertices represent the 18 root vectors of the simple Lie group B3.\nDissection.\nThe \"cuboctahedron\" can be dissected into two triangular cupolas by a common hexagon passing through the center of the cuboctahedron. If these two triangular cupolas are twisted so triangles and squares line up, Johnson solid J27, the triangular orthobicupola, is created.\nThe cuboctahedron can also be dissected into 6 square pyramids and 8 tetrahedra meeting at a central point. This dissection is expressed in the alternated cubic honeycomb where pairs of square pyramids are combined into octahedra.\nGeometric relations.\nSymmetries.\nThe cuboctahedron is the unique convex polyhedron in which the long radius (center to vertex) is the same as the edge length; thus its long diameter (vertex to opposite vertex) is 2 edge lengths. This radial equilateral symmetry is a property of only a few uniform polytopes, including the two-dimensional hexagon, the three-dimensional cuboctahedron, and the four-dimensional 24-cell and 8-cell (tesseract). \"Radially equilateral\" polytopes are those which can be constructed, with their long radii, from equilateral triangles which meet at the center of the polytope, each contributing two radii and an edge. Therefore, all the interior elements which meet at the center of these polytopes have equilateral triangle inward faces, as in the dissection of the cuboctahedron into 6 square pyramids and 8 tetrahedra. Each of these radially equilateral polytopes also occurs as cells of a characteristic space-filling tessellation: the tiling of regular hexagons, the rectified cubic honeycomb (of alternating cuboctahedra and octahedra), the 24-cell honeycomb and the tesseractic honeycomb, respectively. Each tessellation has a dual tessellation; the cell centers in a tessellation are cell vertices in its dual tessellation. The densest known regular sphere-packing in two, three and four dimensions uses the cell centers of one of these tessellations as sphere centers.\nA cuboctahedron has octahedral symmetry. Its first stellation is the compound of a cube and its dual octahedron, with the vertices of the cuboctahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either.\nConstructions.\nA cuboctahedron can be obtained by taking an equatorial cross section of a four-dimensional 24-cell or 16-cell. A hexagon can be obtained by taking an equatorial cross section of a cuboctahedron.\nThe cuboctahedron is a rectified cube and also a rectified octahedron.\nIt is also a cantellated tetrahedron. With this construction it is given the Wythoff symbol: . \nA skew cantellation of the tetrahedron produces a solid with faces parallel to those of the cuboctahedron, namely eight triangles of two sizes, and six rectangles. While its edges are unequal, this solid remains \"vertex-uniform\": the solid has the full tetrahedral symmetry group and its vertices are equivalent under that group.\nThe edges of a cuboctahedron form four regular hexagons. If the cuboctahedron is cut in the plane of one of these hexagons, each half is a triangular cupola, one of the Johnson solids; the cuboctahedron itself thus can also be called a triangular gyrobicupola, the simplest of a series (other than the gyrobifastigium or \"digonal gyrobicupola\"). If the halves are put back together with a twist, so that triangles meet triangles and squares meet squares, the result is another Johnson solid, the triangular orthobicupola, also called an anticuboctahedron.\nBoth triangular bicupolae are important in sphere packing. The distance from the solid's center to its vertices is equal to its edge length. Each central sphere can have up to twelve neighbors, and in a face-centered cubic lattice these take the positions of a cuboctahedron's vertices. In a hexagonal close-packed lattice they correspond to the corners of the triangular orthobicupola. In both cases the central sphere takes the position of the solid's center.\nCuboctahedra appear as cells in three of the convex uniform honeycombs and in nine of the convex uniform 4-polytopes.\nThe volume of the cuboctahedron is of that of the enclosing cube and of that of the enclosing octahedron.\nVertex arrangement.\nBecause it is radially equilateral, the cuboctahedron's center can be treated as a 13th \"canonical apical vertex\", one edge length distant from the 12 ordinary vertices, as the apex of a canonical pyramid is one edge length equidistant from its other vertices.\nThe cuboctahedron shares its edges and vertex arrangement with two nonconvex uniform polyhedra: the cubohemioctahedron (having the square faces in common) and the octahemioctahedron (having the triangular faces in common). It also serves as a cantellated tetrahedron, as being a rectified tetratetrahedron.\nThe cuboctahedron 2-covers the tetrahemihexahedron, which accordingly has the same abstract vertex figure (two triangles and two squares: 3.4.3.4) and half the vertices, edges, and faces. (The actual vertex figure of the tetrahemihexahedron is 3.4..4, with the factor due to the cross.)\nRelated polyhedra.\nThe cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.\nThe cuboctahedron also has tetrahedral symmetry with two colors of triangles.\nRelated quasiregular polyhedra and tilings.\nThe cuboctahedron exists in a sequence of symmetries of quasiregular polyhedra and tilings with vertex configurations (3.\"n\")2, progressing from tilings of the sphere to the Euclidean plane and into the hyperbolic plane. With orbifold notation symmetry of *\"n\"32 all of these tilings are wythoff construction within a fundamental domain of symmetry, with generator points at the right angle corner of the domain.\nThis polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of cantellated polyhedra with vertex figure (3.4.\"n\".4), and continues as tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These vertex-transitive figures have (*\"n\"32) reflectional symmetry.\nRelated polytopes.\nThe cuboctahedron can be decomposed into a regular octahedron and eight irregular but equal octahedra in the shape of the convex hull of a cube with two opposite vertices removed. This decomposition of the cuboctahedron corresponds with the cell-first parallel projection of the 24-cell into three dimensions. Under this projection, the cuboctahedron forms the projection envelope, which can be decomposed into six square faces, a regular octahedron, and eight irregular octahedra. These elements correspond with the images of six of the octahedral cells in the 24-cell, the nearest and farthest cells from the 4D viewpoint, and the remaining eight pairs of cells, respectively.\nCuboctahedral graph.\nIn the mathematical field of graph theory, a cuboctahedral graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the cuboctahedron, one of the Archimedean solids. It can also be constructed as the line graph of the cube. It has 12 vertices and 24 edges, is locally linear, and is a quartic Archimedean graph."}

It has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.\nThe cube is also a square parallelepiped, an equilateral cuboid and a right rhombohedron. It is a regular square prism in three orientations, and a trigonal trapezohedron in four orientations.\nThe cube is dual to the octahedron. It has cubical or octahedral symmetry.\nThe cube is the only convex polyhedron whose faces are all squares.\nOrthogonal projections.\nThe \"cube\" has four special orthogonal projections, centered, on a vertex, edges, face and normal to its vertex figure. The first and third correspond to the A2 and B2 Coxeter planes.\nSpherical tiling.\nThe cube can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths.

Also, a cube has the largest volume among cuboids with the same total linear size (length+width+height).\nPoint in space.\nFor a cube whose circumscribing sphere has radius \"R\", and for a given point in its 3-dimensional space with distances \"di\" from the cube's eight vertices, we have:\nDoubling the cube.\nDoubling the cube, or the \"Delian problem\", was the problem posed by ancient Greek mathematicians of using only a compass and straightedge to start with the length of the edge of a given cube and to construct the length of the edge of a cube with twice the volume of the original cube. They were unable to solve this problem, and in 1837 Pierre Wantzel proved it to be impossible because the cube root of 2 is not a constructible number.\nUniform colorings and symmetry.\nThe cube has three uniform colorings, named by the colors of the square faces around each vertex: 111, 112, 123.\nThe cube has four classes of symmetry, which can be represented by vertex-transitive coloring the faces. The highest octahedral symmetry Oh has all the faces the same color. The dihedral symmetry D4h comes from the cube being a prism, with all four sides being the same color. The prismatic subsets D2d has the same coloring as the previous one and D2h has alternating colors for its sides for a total of three colors, paired by opposite sides. Each symmetry form has a different Wythoff symbol.\nGeometric relations.\nA cube has eleven nets (one shown above): that is, there are eleven ways to flatten a hollow cube by cutting seven edges. To color the cube so that no two adjacent faces have the same color, one would need at least three colors.\nThe cube is the cell of the only regular tiling of three-dimensional Euclidean space. It is also unique among the Platonic solids in having faces with an even number of sides and, consequently, it is the only member of that group that is a zonohedron (every face has point symmetry).\nThe cube can be cut into six identical square pyramids. If these square pyramids are then attached to the faces of a second cube, a rhombic dodecahedron is obtained (with pairs of coplanar triangles combined into rhombic faces).\nOther dimensions.\nThe analogue of a cube in four-dimensional Euclidean space has a special name\u2014a tesseract or hypercube. More properly, a hypercube (or \"n\"-dimensional cube or simply \"n\"-cube) is the analogue of the cube in \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space and a tesseract is the order-4 hypercube. A hypercube is also called a \"measure polytope\".\nThere are analogues of the cube in lower dimensions too: a point in dimension 0, a line segment in one dimension and a square in two dimensions.\nRelated polyhedra.\nThe quotient of the cube by the antipodal map yields a projective polyhedron, the hemicube.\nIf the original cube has edge length 1, its dual polyhedron (an octahedron) has edge length formula_6.\nThe cube is a special case in various classes of general polyhedra:\nThe vertices of a cube can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular tetrahedron; more generally this is referred to as a demicube. These two together form a regular compound, the stella octangula. The intersection of the two forms a regular octahedron. The symmetries of a regular tetrahedron correspond to those of a cube which map each tetrahedron to itself; the other symmetries of the cube map the two to each other.\nOne such regular tetrahedron has a volume of of that of the cube. The remaining space consists of four equal irregular tetrahedra with a volume of of that of the cube, each.\nThe rectified cube is the cuboctahedron. If smaller corners are cut off we get a polyhedron with six octagonal faces and eight triangular ones. In particular we can get regular octagons (truncated cube). The rhombicuboctahedron is obtained by cutting off both corners and edges to the correct amount.\nA cube can be inscribed in a dodecahedron so that each vertex of the cube is a vertex of the dodecahedron and each edge is a diagonal of one of the dodecahedron's faces; taking all such cubes gives rise to the regular compound of five cubes.\nIf two opposite corners of a cube are truncated at the depth of the three vertices directly connected to them, an irregular octahedron is obtained. Eight of these irregular octahedra can be attached to the triangular faces of a regular octahedron to obtain the cuboctahedron.\nThe cube is topologically related to a series of spherical polyhedra and tilings with order-3 vertex figures.\nThe cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.\nThe cube is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular tilings, extending into the hyperbolic plane: {4,p}, p=3,4,5...\nWith dihedral symmetry, Dih4, the cube is topologically related in a series of uniform polyhedra and tilings 4.2n.2n, extending into the hyperbolic plane:\nAll these figures have octahedral symmetry.\nThe cube is a part of a sequence of rhombic polyhedra and tilings with [\"n\",3] Coxeter group symmetry.

Graphs of this sort occur in the theory of parallel processing in computers."}
{"id": "6286", "revid": "23636601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6286", "title": "Commuter rail", "text": "Commuter rail, or suburban rail, is a passenger rail transport service that primarily operates within a metropolitan area, connecting commuters to a central city from adjacent suburbs or commuter towns. Generally commuter rail systems are considered heavy rail, using electrified or diesel trains. Distance charges or zone pricing may be used.\nThe term can refer to systems with a wide variety of different features and service frequencies, but is often used in contrast to rapid transit or light rail.\nSimilar non-English terms include \"Treno suburbano\" in Italian, \"Cercan\u00edas\" in Spanish, \"Rodalies\" in Catalan, Aldiriak in Basque, Rodalia in Valencian, Proximidades in Galician, \"Proastiakos\" in Greek, \"Train de banlieue\" in French, \"P\u0159\u00edm\u011bstsk\u00fd vlak\" or \"Esko\" in Czech, \"Elektrichka\" in Russian, \"Poci\u0105g podmiejski \" in Polish and \"Pendelt\u00e5g\" in Swedish.\nSome services share similarities with both commuter rail and high-frequency rapid transit, examples being the German S-Bahn in some cities, the R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional (RER) in Paris, many Japanese commuter systems, the West Rail line in Hong Kong and some Australasian suburban networks. Some services, like British commuter rail, share tracks with other passenger services and freight.\nIn the United States, commuter rail often refers to services that operate a higher frequency during peak periods and a lower frequency off-peak. Since the creation of Toronto's GO Transit commuter service in 1967, commuter rail services and route length have been expanding in North America. In the US, commuter rail is sometimes referred to as regional rail.\nCharacteristics.\nMost commuter (or suburban) trains are built to main line rail standards, differing from light rail or rapid transit (metro rail) systems by:\nTrain schedule.\nCompared to rapid transit (or metro rail), commuter/suburban rail often has lower frequency, following a schedule rather than fixed intervals, and fewer stations spaced further apart. They primarily serve lower density suburban areas (non inner-city), and often share right-of-way with intercity or freight trains. Some services operate only during peak hours and others uses fewer departures during off peak hours and weekends. Average speeds are high, often 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) or higher. These higher speeds better serve the longer distances involved. Some services include express services which skip some stations in order to run faster and separate longer distance riders from short-distance ones.\nThe general range of commuter trains' travel distance varies between 15 and 200\u00a0km (10 and 125 miles), but longer distances can be covered when the trains run between two or several cities (e.g. S-Bahn in the Ruhr area of Germany). Distances between stations may vary, but are usually much longer than those of urban rail systems. In city centers the train either has a terminal station or passes through the city centre with notably fewer station stops than those of urban rail systems. Toilets are often available on-board trains and in stations.\nTrack.\nTheir ability to coexist with freight or intercity services in the same right-of-way can drastically reduce system construction costs. However, frequently they are built with dedicated tracks within that right-of-way to prevent delays, especially where service densities have converged in the inner parts of the network.\nMost such trains run on the local standard gauge track. Some systems may run on a narrower or broader gauge. Examples of narrow gauge systems are found in Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Switzerland, in the Brisbane (Queensland Rail's City network) and Perth (Transperth) systems in Australia, in some systems in Sweden, and on the in Italy. Some countries and regions, including Finland, India, Pakistan, Russia, Brazil and Sri Lanka, as well as San Francisco (BART) in the US and Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia, use broad gauge track.\nDistinction between other modes of rail.\nMetro.\nMetro rail or rapid transit usually covers a smaller inner-urban area ranging outwards to between 12\u00a0km to 20\u00a0km (or 8 to 14 miles), has a higher train frequency and runs on separate tracks (underground or elevated), whereas commuter rail often shares tracks, technology and the legal framework within mainline railway systems.\nHowever, the classification as a metro or rapid rail can be difficult as both may typically cover a metropolitan area exclusively, run on separate tracks in the centre, and often feature purpose-built rolling stock. The fact that the terminology is not standardised across countries (even across English-speaking countries) further complicates matters. This distinction is most easily made when there are two (or more) systems such as New York's subway and the LIRR and Metro-North Railroad, Paris' M\u00e9tro and RER along with Transilien, Washington D.C.'s Metro along with its MARC and VRE, London's tube lines of the Underground and the Overground, (future) Crossrail, Thameslink along with other commuter rail operators, Madrid's Metro and Cercan\u00edas, Barcelona's Metro and Rodalies, and Tokyo's subway and the JR lines along with various privately owned and operated commuter rail systems.\nS-Trains.\nAn S-Train is a type of hybrid urban-suburban rail serving a metropolitan region, most often in the German-speaking countries. The most well-known S-train systems are the S-Bahn systems in Germany and Austria with other well-known examples being the S-tog in Copenhagen and S-Bahn/RER systems in Switzerland. In Germany, the S-Bahn is regarded as a train category of its own, and exists in many large cities and in some other areas, with differing service and technical standards from city to city. \nMost S-Bahns typically behave like commuter rail with most trackage not separated from other trains, and long lines with trains running between cities and suburbs rather than within a city. The distances between stations however, are usually short. In larger systems there is usually a high frequency metro-like central corridor in the city center into which all the lines converge. Typical examples of large city S-Bahns include Munich and Frankfurt. S-Bahns also exist in some mid-size cities like Rostock and Magdeburg but behave more like typical commuter rail with lower frequencies and very little exclusive trackage. In Berlin, the S-Bahn systems arguably fulfill all considerations of a true metro system (despite the existence of U-Bahns as well) \u2013 the trains run on tracks that are entirely separated from other trains, there are short distances between stations, the trains are high frequency, and use tunnels but do run a bit further out from the city centre compared with U-Bahn. In Hamburg and Copenhagen, other, diesel driven trains, do continue where the S-Bahn ends (\"A-Bahn\" in Hamburg area, and \"L-tog\" in Copenhagen).\nRegional rail.\nRegional rail usually provides rail services between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs in the way inter-city rail does. Regional rail operates outside major cities. Unlike Inter-city, it stops at most or all stations between cities. It provides a service between smaller communities along the line, and also connections with long-distance services at interchange stations located at junctions or at larger towns along the line. Alternative names are \"local train\" or \"stopping train\". Examples include the former BR's Regional Railways, France's TER (\"Transport express r\u00e9gional\"), Germany's DB Regio and South Korea's Tonggeun services.\nRegional rail does not exist in this sense in the United States, so the term \"regional rail\" has become synonymous with commuter rail there, although the two are more clearly defined in Europe.\nInter-city rail.\nIn some European countries the distinction between commuter trains and long-distance/intercity trains is very hard to make, because of the relatively short distances involved. For example, so-called \"intercity\" trains in Belgium and the Netherlands carry many commuters and their equipment, range and speeds are similar to those of commuter trains in some larger countries. In the United Kingdom there is no real division of organisation and brand name between commuter, regional and inter-city trains, making it hard to categorize train connections.\nRussian commuter trains, on the other hand, frequently cover areas larger than Belgium itself, although these are still short distances by Russian standards. They have a different ticketing system from long-distance trains, and in major cities they often operate from a separate section of the train station.\nThe easiest way to identify these \"inter-city\" services is that they tend to operate as express services - only linking the main stations in the cities they link, not stopping at any other stations. However, this term is used in Australia (Sydney for example) to describe the regional trains operating beyond the boundaries of the suburban services, even though some of these \"inter-city\" services stop all stations similar to German regional services. In this regard, the German service delineations and corresponding naming conventions are clearer and better used for academic purposes.\nHigh-speed rail.\nSometimes high-speed rail can serve daily use of commuters. The Japanese Shinkansen high speed rail system is heavily used by commuters in the Greater Tokyo Area. They commute between 100 and 200\u00a0km by Shinkansen. To meet the demand of commuters, JR sells commuter discount passes and operates 16-car bilevel E4 Series Shinkansen trains at rush hour, providing a capacity of 1,600 seats. Several lines in China, such as the Beijing\u2013Tianjin Intercity Railway and the Shanghai\u2013Nanjing High-Speed Railway, serve a similar role with many more under construction or planned.\nThe high-speed services linking Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Basel in Switzerland () have brought the Central Business Districts (CBDs) of these three cities within 1 hour of each other. This has resulted in unexpectedly high demand for new commuter trips between the three cities and a corresponding increase in suburban rail passengers accessing the high-speed services at the main city-centre stations (or Hauptbahnhof). The Regional-Express commuter service between Munich and Nuremberg in Germany go in () along a 300 km/h high-speed line.\nThe regional trains Stockholm\u2013Uppsala, Stockholm\u2013V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Stockholm\u2013Eskilstuna and Gothenburg\u2013Trollh\u00e4ttan in Sweden reach and have many daily commuters.\nTrain types.\nCommuter/suburban trains are usually optimized for maximum passenger volume, in most cases without sacrificing too much comfort and luggage space, though they seldom have all the amenities of long-distance trains. Cars may be single- or double-level, and aim to provide seating for all. Compared to intercity trains, they have less space, fewer amenities and limited baggage areas.\nMultiple unit type.\nCommuter rail trains are usually composed of multiple units, which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) bogie. Depending on local circumstances and tradition they may be powered either by diesel engines located below the passenger compartment (diesel multiple units) or by electricity picked up from third rails or overhead lines (electric multiple units). Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.\nLocomotive hauled services.\nLocomotive hauled services are used in some countries or locations. This is often a case of asset sweating, by using a single large combined fleet for intercity and regional services. Loco hauled services are usually run in push-pull formation, that is, the train can run with the locomotive at the \"front\" or \"rear\" of the train (pushing or pulling). Trains are often equipped with a control cab at the other end of the train from the locomotive, allowing the train operator to operate the train from either end. The motive power for locomotive-hauled commuter trains may be either electric or diesel-electric, although some countries, such as Germany and some of the former Soviet-bloc countries, also use diesel-hydraulic locomotives.\nSeat plans.\nIn the US and some other countries, a three-and-two seat plan is used. However, few people sit in the middle seat on these trains because they feel crowded and uncomfortable.\nIn Japan and South Korea, longitudinal (sideways window-lining) seating is widely used in many commuter rail trains to increase capacity in rush hours. Carriages are usually not organized to increase seating capacity (although in some trains at least one carriage would feature more doors to facilitate easier boarding and alighting and bench seats so that they can be folded up during rush hour to provide more standing room) even in the case of commuting longer than 50\u00a0km and commuters in the Greater Tokyo Area and the Seoul metropolitan area have to stand in the train for more than an hour.\nCommuter rail systems around the world.\nAfrica.\nCurrently there are not many examples of commuter rail in Africa. Metrorail operates in the major cities of South Africa, and there are some commuter rail services in Algeria, Botswana, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia.\nIn Algeria, SNTF operates commuter rail lines between the capital Algiers and its southern and eastern suburbs. They also serve to connect Algiers' main universities to each other. The Dar es Salaam commuter rail offers intracity services in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In Botswana, the (Botswana Railways) \"BR Express\" has a commuter train between Lobatse and Gaborone.\nAsia.\nEast Asia.\nIn Japan, commuter rail systems have extensive network and frequent service and are heavily used. In many cases, Japanese commuter rail is operationally more like a typical metro system (with very high operating frequencies, an emphasis on standing passengers, short station spacing) than it is like commuter rail in other countries. Japanese commuter rail also tends to be heavily interlined with subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems on the other side of the city. Many Japanese commuter systems operate several levels of express trains to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station bypass tracks instead of dedicated express tracks. It is notable that the larger Japanese commuter rail systems are owned and operated by for-profit private railway companies, without public subsidy.\nCommuter rail systems have been inaugurated in several cities in China such as Beijing, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Changsha and the Pearl River Delta. With plans for large systems in northeastern Zhejiang, Jingjinji, and Yangtze River Delta areas. The level of service varies considerably from line to line ranging high to near high speeds. More developed and established lines such as the Guangshen Railway have more frequent metro like service. Hong Kong MTR's East Rail line, West Rail line and Tung Chung line were built to commuter rail standards but are operated as a metro system.\nIn Taiwan, Western line in Taipei-Taoyuan Metropolitan Area, Taichung Metropolitan Area, Tainan-Kaohsiung Metropolitan Area as well as Neiwan-Liujia line in Hsinchu Area is considered commuter rail.\nOther examples in East Asia include Seoul Metropolitan Subway of which some lines are suburban lines operated by Korail in South Korea.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn Indonesia, the KRL Commuterline is the largest commuter rail system in the country, serving Jakarta metropolitan area. It connects the Jakarta city center with surrounding cities and sub-urbans in Banten and West Java provinces, including Depok, Bogor, Tangerang, Bekasi, Serpong, Rangkasbitung, and Maja. In July 2015, KA Commuter Jabodetabek served more than 850,000 passengers per day, which is almost triple of the 2011 figures, but still less than 3.5% of all Jabodetabek commutes. Other commuter rail systems in Indonesia include the Metro Surabaya Commuter Line, Prambanan Ekspres, KRL Commuterline Yogyakarta\u2013Solo, Kedung Sepur, Greater Bandung Commuter, and Cut Meutia.\nIn the Philippines, the Philippine National Railways has two commuter rail systems currently operational; the PNR Metro Commuter Line in the Greater Manila Area and the PNR Bicol Commuter in the Bicol Region. A new commuter rail line in Metro Manila, the North\u2013South Commuter Railway, is currently under construction. Its North section is set to be partially opened by 2021.\nIn Malaysia, there are two commuter services operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu. They are the KTM Komuter that serves Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding Klang Valley area, and the KTM Komuter Northern Sector that serves Greater Penang, Perak, Kedah and Perlis in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia.\nIn Thailand, the Greater Bangkok Commuter rail and the Airport Rail Link serve the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. The SRT Red Lines, a new commuter line in Bangkok, started construction in 2009. It is currently slated to be opened by 2020.\nAnother commuter rail system in Southeast Asia is the Yangon Circular Railway in Myanmar.\nSouth Asia.\n\"Main articles: Mumbai Suburban Railway, Kolkata Suburban Railway, Chennai Suburban Railway\" \nIn India, commuter rail systems are present in major cities. Mumbai Suburban Railway, the oldest suburban rail system in Asia, carries more than 7.24 million commuters on a daily basis which constitutes more than half of the total daily passenger capacity of the Indian Railways itself. Kolkata Suburban Railway is the biggest Suburban Railway network in India covering 348 stations carries more than 3.5 million commuters per day. The Chennai Suburban Railway along with MRTS is another railway of comparison where more than 2.5 million people travel daily to different areas in Chennai. Other commuter railways in India include Hyderabad MMTS, Delhi Suburban Railway, Pune Suburban Railway and Lucknow-Kanpur Suburban Railway.\nDelhi Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) is under construction on 3 routes in Delhi NCR.The rotes have planned according to R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional suburban lines in Paris.\nKarachi in Pakistan has had a circular railway since 1969.\nAlso, in Bangladesh, there are several commuter rail systems.\nWest Asia.\nIn Iran, SYSTRA has done a \"Tehran long term urban rail study\". SYSTRA proposed 4 express lines similar to RER suburban lines in Paris. Tehran Metro is going to construct express lines. For instance, the Rahyab Behineh, a consultant for Tehran Metro, is studying Tehran Express Line 2. Tehran Metro currently has a commuter line, which is Line 5 between Tehran and Karaj. Isfahan has two lines to its suburbs Baharestan and Fuladshahr under construction, and a third line to Shahinshahr is planned.\nIn Turkey; Ba\u015fkentray, \u0130ZBAN, and Marmaray are well-known examples.\nEurope.\nMajor metropolitan areas in most European countries are usually served by extensive commuter/suburban rail systems. Well-known examples include BG Voz in Belgrade (Serbia), S-Bahn in Germany and German-speaking areas of Switzerland and Austria, Proastiakos in Greece, RER in France and Belgium, suburban lines in Milan (Italy), Turin metropolitan railway service in Turin (Italy), Cercan\u00edas and Rodalies (Catalonia) in Spain, CP Urban Services in Portugal, Esko in Prague and Ostrava (Czech Republic), H\u00c9V in Budapest (Hungary) and DART in Dublin (Ireland).\nIn Russia, Ukraine and some other countries of the former Soviet Union, electrical multiple unit passenger suburban trains called Elektrichka are widespread.\nIn Sweden, electrified commuter rail systems known as \"Pendelt\u00e5g\" are present in the cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg. The Stockholm commuter rail system, which began in 1968, is similar to the S-Bahn train systems of Munich and Frankfurt such that it may share railway tracks with inter-city trains and freight trains, but for the most part run on its own dedicated tracks, and that it is primarily used to transport passengers from nearby towns and other suburban areas into the city centre, not for transportation inside the city centre. The Gothenburg commuter rail system, which began in 1960, is similar to the Stockholm system, but does fully share tracks with long-distance trains. Other train systems that are also considered as commuter rail but not counted as \"pendelt\u00e5g\" include Roslagsbanan and Saltsj\u00f6banan in Stockholm, M\u00e4lart\u00e5g in the M\u00e4laren Valley, \u00d6stg\u00f6tapendeln in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County, Uppt\u00e5get in Uppsala County, Norrt\u00e5g in northern Norrland and Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail in Sk\u00e5ne County. Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail (\"P\u00e5gat\u00e5gen\") acts also as a regional rail system, as it serves cities over 100\u00a0km (62 miles) and over one hour from the principal city of Malm\u00f6.\nIn Norway, the Oslo commuter rail system mostly shares tracks with more long-distance trains, but also runs on some local railways without other traffic. Oslo has the largest commuter rail system in the Nordic countries in terms of line lengths and number of stations. But some lines have travel times (over an hour from Oslo) and frequencies (once per hour) which are more like regional trains. Also Bergen, Stavanger and Trondheim have commuter rail systems. These have only one or two lines each and they share tracks with other trains.\nIn Finland, the Helsinki commuter rail network runs on dedicated tracks from Helsinki Central railway station to Lepp\u00e4vaara and Kerava. The Ring Rail Line serves Helsinki Airport and northern suburbs of Vantaa and is exclusively used by the commuter rail network. On 15 December 2019 Tampere got its own commuter rail service.\nIn Poland, commuter rail systems exist in Tricity, Warsaw, Krakow (SKM) and Katowice (SKR). There is also a similar system planned in Wroc\u0142aw and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\nIn Romania, the first commuter trains were introduced in December 2019. They operate currently between Bucharest and Funduea or Buftea.\nAmericas.\nNorth America.\nIn the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Mexico regional passenger rail services are provided by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, with a limited number of metropolitan areas served.\nUnited States.\nEight commuter rail systems in the United States carried over ten million trips in 2018, those being in descending order:\nOther commuter rail systems in the United States (not in ridership order) are:\nSouth America.\nExamples include an commuter system in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, the long Supervia in Rio de Janeiro, the Metrotr\u00e9n in Santiago, Chile, and the Valpara\u00edso Metro in Valpara\u00edso, Chile. Another example is Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) in Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. CPTM has 94 stations with seven lines, numbered starting on 7 (the lines 1 to 6 and the line 15 belong to the S\u00e3o Paulo Metro), with a total length of .\nOceania.\nThe five major cities in Australia have suburban railway systems in their metropolitan areas. These networks have frequent services, with frequencies varying from every 10 to every 30 minutes on most suburban lines, and up to 3\u20135 minutes in peak on bundled underground lines in the city centres of Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne. The networks in each state developed from mainline railways and have never been completely operationally separate from long distance and freight traffic, unlike metro systems in some comparable countries, but nevertheless have cohesive identities and are the backbones of their respective cities' public transport system. The suburban networks are almost completely electrified.\nThe main suburban rail networks in Australia are:\nNew Zealand has two frequent suburban rail services comparable to those in Australia: the Auckland rail network is operated by Transdev Auckland and the Wellington rail network is operated by Transdev Wellington."}

{"id": "6288", "revid": "16195609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6288", "title": "Cambridgeshire", "text": "Cambridgeshire (abbreviated Cambs.) is a county in the East of England, bordering Lincolnshire to the north, Norfolk to the north-east, Suffolk to the east, Essex and Hertfordshire to the south, and Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire to the west. The city of Cambridge is the county town. Modern Cambridgeshire was formed in 1974 through the amalgamation of two administrative counties: Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely, comprising the historic county of Cambridgeshire (including the Isle of Ely); and Huntingdon and Peterborough, comprising the historic county of Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough, historically part of Northamptonshire. Cambridgeshire contains most of the region known as Silicon Fen.\nThe county is now divided between Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council, which since 1998 has formed a separate unitary authority. In the county there are five district councils, Cambridge City Council, East Cambridgeshire District Council, Fenland District Council, Huntingdonshire District Council and South Cambridgeshire District Council.\nHistory.\nCambridgeshire is noted as the site of Flag Fen in Fengate, one of the earliest-known Neolithic permanent settlements in the United Kingdom, compared in importance to Balbridie in Aberdeen, Scotland. Must Farm quarry, at Whittlesey has been described as 'Britain's Pompeii due to its relatively good condition, including the 'best-preserved Bronze Age dwellings ever found'. A great quantity of archaeological finds from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age were made in East Cambridgeshire. Most items were found in Isleham.\nThe area was settled by the Anglo-Saxons starting in the fifth century. Genetic testing on seven skeletons found in Anglo-Saxon era graves in Hinxton and Oakington found that five were either migrants or descended from migrants from the continent, one was a native Briton, and one had both continental and native ancestry, suggesting intermarriage.\nCambridgeshire was recorded in the \"Domesday Book\" as \"Grantbridgeshire\" (or rather \"Grentebrigescire\") (related to the river Granta).\nCovering a large part of East Anglia, Cambridgeshire today is the result of several local government unifications. In 1888 when county councils were introduced, separate councils were set up, following the traditional division of Cambridgeshire, for\nIn 1965, these two administrative counties were merged to form Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely.\nUnder the Local Government Act 1972 this merged with the county to the west, Huntingdon and Peterborough, which had been formed in 1965, by the merger of Huntingdonshire with the Soke of Peterborough (the latter previously a part of Northamptonshire with its own county council). The resulting county was called simply Cambridgeshire.\nSince 1998, the City of Peterborough has been a separately administered area, as a unitary authority. It is associated with Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes such as Lieutenancy, and joint functions such as policing and the fire service.\nIn 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife unofficially designated Cambridgeshire's county flower as the Pasqueflower.\nThe Cambridgeshire Regiment (nicknamed the Fen Tigers), the county-based army unit, fought in the Boer War in South Africa, the First World War and Second World War \nDue to the county's flat terrain and proximity to the continent, during the Second World War the military built many airfields here for RAF Bomber Command, RAF Fighter Command, and the allied USAAF. In recognition of this collaboration, the Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial is located in Madingley. It is the only WWII burial ground in England for American servicemen who died during that event.\nMost English counties have nicknames for their people, such as a \"Tyke\" from Yorkshire and a \"Yellowbelly\" from Lincolnshire. The traditional nicknames for people from Cambridgeshire are \"Cambridgeshire Camel\" or \"Cambridgeshire Crane\", referring to the wildfowl that were once abundant in the fens. The term \"Fen Tigers\" is sometimes used to describe the people who live and work in the fenlands.\nOriginal historical documents relating to Cambridgeshire are held by Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies.\nGeography.\nLarge areas of the county are extremely low-lying and Holme Fen is notable for being the UK's lowest physical point at 2.75\u00a0m (9\u00a0ft) below sea level. The highest point of the modern administrative county is in the village of Great Chishill at 146\u00a0m (480\u00a0ft) above sea level. However, this parish was historically a part of Essex, having been moved to Cambridgeshire in boundary changes in 1895. The historic county top is close to the village of Castle Camps where a point on the disused RAF airfield reaches a height of above sea level (grid reference TL 63282 41881).\nOther prominent hills are Little Trees Hill and Wandlebury Hill (both at ) in the Gog Magog Hills, Rivey Hill above Linton, Rowley's Hill and the Madingley Hills.\nGreen belt.\nCambridgeshire contains all its green belt around the city of Cambridge, extending to places such as Waterbeach, Lode, Duxford, Little &amp; Great Abington and other communities a few miles away in nearby districts, to afford a protection from the conurbation. It was first drawn up in the 1950s.\nPolitics.\nCambridgeshire contains seven Parliamentary constituencies:\nEconomy.\nThis is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Cambridgeshire at current basic prices published (pp.\u00a0240\u2013253) by \"Office for National Statistics\" with figures in millions of English Pounds Sterling.\nAWG plc is based in Huntingdon. The RAF has several stations in the Huntingdon and St Ives area. RAF Alconbury, 3 miles north of Huntingdon, is being reorganised after a period of obsolescence following the departure of the USAF, to be the focus of RAF/USAFE intelligence operations, with activities at Upwood and Molesworth being transferred there. Most of Cambridgeshire is agricultural. Close to Cambridge is the so-called Silicon Fen area of high-technology (electronics, computing and biotechnology) companies. ARM Limited is based in Cherry Hinton.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary.\nCambridgeshire has a completely comprehensive education system with 12 independent schools and over 240 state schools, not including sixth form colleges.\nSome of the secondary schools act as Village Colleges, institutions unique to Cambridgeshire. For example, Bottisham Village College.\nTertiary.\nCambridgeshire is home to a number of institutes of higher education:\nIn addition, Cambridge Regional College and Huntingdonshire Regional College both offer a limited range of higher education courses in conjunction with partner universities.\nSettlements.\nThese are the settlements in Cambridgeshire with a town charter, city status or a population over 5,000; for a complete list of settlements see list of places in Cambridgeshire.\nSee the List of Cambridgeshire settlements by population page for more detail.\nThe town of Newmarket is surrounded on three sides by Cambridgeshire, being connected by a narrow strip of land to the rest of Suffolk.\nCambridgeshire has seen 32,869 dwellings created from 2002 to 2013 and there are a further 35,360 planned new dwellings between 2016 and 2023.\nClimate.\nCambridgeshire has a maritime temperate climate which is broadly similar to the rest of the United Kingdom, though it is drier than the UK average due to its low altitude and easterly location, the prevailing southwesterly winds having already deposited moisture on higher ground further west. Average winter temperatures are cooler than the English average, due to Cambridgeshire's inland location and relative nearness to continental Europe, which results in the moderating maritime influence being less strong. Snowfall is slightly more common than in western areas, due to the relative winter coolness and easterly winds bringing occasional snow from the North Sea. In summer temperatures are average or slightly above, due to less cloud cover. It reaches on around 10 days each year, and is comparable to parts of Kent and East Anglia.\nCulture.\nSports.\nVarious forms of football have been popular in Cambridgeshire since medieval times at least. In 1579 one match played at Chesterton between townspeople and Cambridge University students ended in a violent brawl that led the Vice-Chancellor to issue a decree forbidding them to play \"footeball\u201d outside of college grounds. During the nineteenth century, several formulations of the laws of football, known as the Cambridge rules, were created by students at the University. One of these codes, dating from 1863, had a significant influence on the creation of the original laws of the Football Association.\nCambridgeshire is also the birthplace of bandy, now an IOC accepted sport. According to documents from 1813, Bury Fen Bandy Club was undefeated for 100 years. A member of the club, Charles Goodman Tebbutt, wrote down the first official rules in 1882. Tebbutt was instrumental in spreading the sport to many countries. Great Britain Bandy Federation is based in Cambridgeshire.\nFen skating is a traditional form of skating in the Fenland. The National Ice Skating Association was set up in Cambridge in 1879, they took the top Fen skaters to the worldspeed skating championships where James Smart became world champion.\nOn 6\u20137 June 2015, the inaugural Tour of Cambridgeshire cycle race took place on closed roads across the county. The event was an official UCI qualification event, and consisted of a Time Trial on the 6th, and a Gran Fondo event on the 7th. The Gran Fondo event was open to the public, and over 6000 riders took part in the race.\nThere is only one racecourse in Cambridgeshire, located at Huntingdon.\nContemporary art.\nCambridge is home to the Kettle's Yard gallery and the artist-run Aid and Abet project space. Nine miles west of Cambridge next to the village of Bourn is Wysing Arts Centre.\nCambridge Open Studios is the regions largest arts organisation with over 500 members. Every year, more than 370 artists open their doors to visitors during four weekends in July."}

He is remembered today for Goldbach's conjecture.\nBiography.\nBorn in the Duchy of Prussia's capital K\u00f6nigsberg, part of Brandenburg-Prussia, Goldbach was the son of a pastor. He studied at the Royal Albertus University.\nAfter finishing his studies he went on long educational voyages from 1710 to 1724 through Europe, visiting other German states, England, Holland, Italy, and France, meeting with many famous mathematicians, such as Gottfried Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, and Nicholas I Bernoulli. Back in K\u00f6nigsberg he got acquainted with Georg Bernhard Bilfinger and Jakob Hermann.\nHe went on to work at the newly opened St Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1725, as a professor of mathematics and historian of the academy. In 1728, when Peter II became Tsar of Russia, Goldbach became his tutor. In 1742 he entered the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nChristian Goldbach was multilingual \u2013 he wrote a diary in German and Latin, his letters were written in German, Latin, French, and Italian and for official documents he used Russian, German and Latin.\nHe died on November 20, 1764 at age of 74, in \nMoscow.\nContributions.\nGoldbach is most noted for his correspondence with Leibniz, Euler, and Bernoulli, especially in his 1742 letter to Euler stating his Goldbach's conjecture. He also studied and proved some theorems on perfect powers, such as the Goldbach\u2013Euler theorem, and made several notable contributions to analysis. He also proved a result concerning Fermat numbers that is called Goldbach's theorem."}
