{"id": "8715", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8715", "title": "Taiko", "text": " are a broad range of Japanese percussion instruments. In Japanese, the term refers to any kind of drum, but outside Japan, it is used specifically to refer to any of the various Japanese drums called and to the form of ensemble taiko drumming more specifically called . The process of constructing taiko varies between manufacturers, and the preparation of both the drum body and skin can take several years depending on the method.\nTaiko have a mythological origin in Japanese folklore, but historical records suggest that taiko were introduced to Japan through Korean and Chinese cultural influence as early as the 6th century CE. Some taiko are similar to instruments originating from India. Archaeological evidence also supports the view that taiko were present in Japan during the 6th century in the Kofun period. Their function has varied throughout history, ranging from communication, military action, theatrical accompaniment, and religious ceremony to both festival and concert performances. In modern times, taiko have also played a central role in social movements for minorities both within and outside Japan.\n\"Kumi-daiko\" performance, characterized by an ensemble playing on different drums, was developed in 1951 through the work of Daihachi Oguchi and has continued with groups such as Kodo. Other performance styles, such as \"hachij\u014d-daiko\", have also emerged from specific communities in Japan. \"Kumi-daiko\" performance groups are active not only in Japan, but also in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Taiwan, and Brazil. Taiko performance consists of many components in technical rhythm, form, stick grip, clothing, and the particular instrumentation. Ensembles typically use different types of barrel-shaped \"nagad\u014d-daiko\" as well as smaller \"shime-daiko\". Many groups accompany the drums with vocals, strings, and woodwind instruments.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe origin of the instruments is unclear, though there have been many suggestions. Historical accounts, of which the earliest date from 588\u00a0CE, note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the kakko, a drum that originated in South China. This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko. Certain court music styles, especially gigaku and gagaku, arrived in Japan through both Korea and China. In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko. Certain percussive patterns and terminology in togaku, an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the kakko, also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance.\nArchaeological evidence shows that taiko were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE, during the latter part of the Kofun period, and were likely used for communication, in festivals, and in other rituals. This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of haniwa statues in the Sawa District of Gunma Prefecture. Two of these figures are depicted playing drums; one of them, wearing skins, is equipped with a barrel-shaped drum hung from his shoulder and uses a stick to play the drum at hip height. This statue is titled \"Man Beating the Taiko\" and is considered the oldest evidence of taiko performance in Japan. Similarities between the playing style demonstrated by this haniwa and known music traditions in Korea and China further suggest influences from these regions.\nThe \"Nihon Shoki\", the second oldest book of Japanese classical history, contains a mythological story describing the origin of taiko. The myth tells how Amaterasu, who had sealed herself inside a cave in anger, was beckoned out by an elder goddess Ame-no-Uzume when others had failed. Ame-no-Uzume accomplished this by emptying out a barrel of sake and dancing furiously on top of it. Historians regard her performance as the mythological creation of taiko music.\nUse in warfare.\nIn feudal Japan, taiko were often used to motivate troops, call out orders or announcements, and set a marching pace; marches were usually set to six paces per beat of the drum. During the 16th-century Warring States period, specific drum calls were used to communicate orders for retreating and advancing. Other rhythms and techniques were detailed in period texts. According to the war chronicle \"Gunji Yosh\u016b\", nine sets of five beats would summon an ally to battle, while nine sets of three beats, sped up three or four times, was the call to advance and pursue an enemy. Folklore from the 16th century on the legendary 6th-century Emperor Keitai offers a story that he obtained a large drum from China, which he named . The Emperor was thought to have used it to both encourage his own army and intimidate his enemies.\nIn traditional settings.\nTaiko have been incorporated in Japanese theatre for rhythmic needs, general atmosphere, and in certain settings decoration. In the kabuki play \"The Tale of Shiroishi and the Taihei Chronicles\", scenes in the pleasure quarters are accompanied by taiko to create dramatic tension. Noh theatre also feature taiko where performance consists of highly specific rhythmic patterns. The school of drumming, for example, contains 65 basic patterns in addition to 25 special patterns; these patterns are categorized in several classes. Differences between these patterns include changes in tempo, accent, dynamics, pitch, and function in the theatrical performance. Patterns are also often connected together in progressions.\nTaiko continue to be used in gagaku, a classical music tradition typically performed at the Tokyo Imperial Palace in addition to local temples and shrines. In gagaku, one component of the art form is traditional dance, which is guided in part by the rhythm set by the taiko. Taiko have played an important role in many local festivals across Japan. They are also used to accompany religious ritual music. In kagura, which is a category of music and dances stemming from Shinto practices, taiko frequently appear alongside other performers during local festivals. In Buddhist traditions, taiko are used for ritual dances that are a part of the Bon Festival. Taiko, along with other instruments, are featured atop towers that are adorned with red-and-white cloth and serve to provide rhythms for the dancers who are encircled around the performers.\nKumi-daiko.\nIn addition to the instruments, the term \"taiko\" also refers to the performance itself, and commonly to one style called \"kumi-daiko\", or ensemble-style playing (as opposed to festival performances, rituals, or theatrical use of the drums). \"Kumi-daiko\" was developed by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. He is considered a master performer and helped transform taiko performance from its roots in traditional settings in festivals and shrines. Oguchi was trained as a jazz musician in Nagano, and at one point, a relative gave him an old piece of written taiko music. Unable to read the traditional and esoteric notation, Oguchi found help to transcribe the piece, and on his own added rhythms and transformed the work to accommodate multiple taiko players on different-sized instruments. Each instrument served a specific purpose that established present-day conventions in \"kumi-daiko\" performance.\nOguchi's ensemble, Osuwa Daiko, incorporated these alterations and other drums into their performances. They also devised novel pieces that were intended for non-religious performances. Several other groups emerged in Japan through the 1950s and 1960s. Oedo Sukeroku Daiko was formed in Tokyo in 1959 under Seid\u014d Kobayashi, and has been referred to as the first taiko group who toured professionally. Globally, \"kumi-daiko\" performance became more visible during the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, when it was featured during the Festival of Arts event.\n\"Kumi-daiko\" was also developed through the leadership of , who gathered young men who were willing to devote their entire lifestyle to taiko playing and took them to Sado Island for training where Den and his family had settled in 1968. Den chose the island based on a desire to reinvigorate the folk arts in Japan, particularly taiko; he became inspired by a drumming tradition unique to Sado called that required considerable strength to play well. Den called the group \"Za Ondekoza\" or Ondekoza for short, and implemented a rigorous set of exercises for its members including long-distance running. In 1975, Ondekoza was the first taiko group to tour in the United States. Their first performance occurred just after the group finished running the Boston Marathon while wearing their traditional uniforms. In 1981, some members of Ondekoza split from Den and formed another group called Kodo under the leadership of Eitetsu Hayashi. Kodo continued to use Sado Island for rigorous training and communal living, and went on to popularize taiko through frequent touring and collaborations with other musical performers. Kodo is one of the most recognized taiko groups both in Japan and worldwide.\nEstimates of the number of taiko groups in Japan vary up to 5000 active in Japan, but more conservative assessments place the number closer to 800 based on membership in the Nippon Taiko Foundation, the largest national organization of taiko groups. Some pieces that have emerged from early \"kumi-daiko\" groups that continue to be performed include \"Yatai-bayashi\" from Ondekoza, from Osuwa Daiko, and from Kodo.\nCategorization.\nTaiko have been developed into a broad range of percussion instruments that are used in both Japanese folk and classical musical traditions. An early classification system based on shape and tension was advanced by Francis Taylor Piggott in 1909. Taiko are generally classified based on the construction process, or the specific context in which the drum is used, but some are not classified, such as the toy den-den daiko.\nWith few exceptions, taiko have a drum shell with heads on both sides of the body, and a sealed resonating cavity. The head may be fastened to the shell using a number of different systems, such as using ropes. Taiko may be either tunable or non-tunable depending on the system used.\nTaiko are categorized into three types based on construction process. \"By\u014d-uchi-daiko\" are constructed with the drumhead nailed to the body. \"Shime-daiko\" are classically constructed with the skin placed over iron or steel rings, which are then tightened with ropes. Contemporary \"shime-daiko\" are tensioned using bolts or turnbuckles systems attached to the drum body. \"Tsuzumi\" are also rope-tensioned drums, but have a distinct hourglass shape and their skins are made using deerskin.\n\"By\u014d-uchi-daiko\" were historically made only using a single piece of wood; they continue to be made in this manner, but are also constructed from staves of wood. Larger drums can be made using a single piece of wood, but at a much greater cost due to the difficulty in finding appropriate trees. The preferred wood is the Japanese zelkova or \"keyaki\", but a number of other woods, and even wine barrels, have been used to create taiko. \"By\u014d-uchi-daiko\" cannot be tuned.\nThe typical \"by\u014d-uchi-daiko\" is the \"nagad\u014d-daiko\", an elongated drum that is roughly shaped like a wine barrel. \"Nagad\u014d-daiko\" are available in a variety of sizes, and their head diameter is traditionally measured in shaku (units of roughly 30\u00a0cm). Head diameters range from . are the smallest of these drums and are usually about in diameter. The is a medium-sized \"nagad\u014d-daiko\" ranging from , and weighing about . vary in size, and are often as large as in diameter. Some \"\u014d-daiko\" are difficult to move due to their size, and therefore permanently remain inside the performance space, such as temple or shrine. \"\u014c-daiko\" means \"large drum\" and for a given ensemble, the term refers to their largest drum. The other type of \"by\u014d-uchi-daiko\" is called a and can be any drum constructed such that the head diameter is greater than the length of the body.\n\"Shime-daiko\" are a set of smaller, roughly snare drum-sized instrument that are tunable. The tensioning system usually consists of hemp cords or rope, but bolt or turnbuckle systems have been used as well. , sometimes referred to as \"taiko\" in the context of theater, have thinner heads than other kinds of shime-daiko. The head includes a patch of deerskin placed in the center, and in performance, drum strokes are generally restricted to this area. The is a heavier type of \"shime-daiko\". They are available in sizes 1\u20135, and are named according to their number: \"namitsuke\"\u00a0(1), \"nich\u014d-gakke\"\u00a0(2), \"sanch\u014d-gakke\"\u00a0(3), \"yonch\u014d-gakke\"\u00a0(4), and \"goch\u014d-gakke\"\u00a0(5). The \"namitsuke\" has the thinnest skins and the shortest body in terms of height; thickness and tension of skins, as well as body height, increase toward the \"goch\u014d-gakke\". The head diameters of all \"shime-daiko\" sizes are around .\n is a type of racket-shaped japanese drum. It is the only japanese traditional drum without a sound box and only one skin. It is played with a drumstick while hanging it with the other hand.\n\"Oked\u014d-daiko\" or simply \"oked\u014d\", are a type of \"shime-daiko\" that are stave-constructed using narrower strips of wood, have a tube-shaped frame. Like other \"shime-daiko\", drum heads are attached by metal hoops and fastened by rope or cords. \"Oked\u014d\" can be played using the same drumsticks (called \"bachi\") as \"shime-daiko\", but can also be hand-played. \"Oked\u014d\" come in short- and long-bodied types.\n\"Tsuzumi\" are a class of hourglass-shaped drums. The drum body is shaped on a spool and the inner body carved by hand. Their skins can be made from cowhide, horsehide, or deerskin. While the \"\u014d-tsuzumi\" skins are made from cowhide, \"ko-tsuzumi\" are made from horsehide. While some classify \"tsuzumi\" as a type of taiko, others have described them as a drum entirely separate from taiko.\nTaiko can also be categorized by the context in which they are used. The \"miya-daiko\", for instance, is constructed in the same manner as other \"by\u014d-uchi-daiko\", but is distinguished by an ornamental stand and is used for ceremonial purposes at Buddhist temples. The (a \"ko-daiko\") and (a \"nagad\u014d-daiko\" with a cigar-shaped body) are used in sumo and festivals respectively.\nSeveral drums, categorized as \"gagakki\", are used in the Japanese theatrical form, gagaku. The lead instrument of the ensemble is the kakko, which is a smaller \"shime-daiko\" with heads made of deerskin, and is placed horizontally on a stand during performance. A \"tsuzumi\", called the \"san-no-tsuzumi\" is another small drum in gagaku that is placed horizontally and struck with a thin stick. are the largest drums of the ensemble, and have heads that are about in diameter. During performance, the drum is placed on a tall pedestals and surrounded by a rim decoratively painted with flames and adorned with mystical figures such as wyverns. \"Dadaiko\" are played while standing, and are usually only played on the downbeat of the music. The is a smaller drum that produces a lower sound, its head measuring about in diameter. It is used in ensembles that accompany bugaku, a traditional dance performed at the Tokyo Imperial Palace and in religious contexts. \"Tsuri-daiko\" are suspended on a small stand, and are played sitting down. \"Tsuri-daiko\" performers typically use shorter mallets covered in leather knobs instead of bachi. They can be played simultaneously by two performers; while one performer plays on the head, another performer uses bachi on the body of the drum.\nThe larger \"\u014d-tsuzumi\" and smaller \"ko-tsuzumi\" are used in the opening and dances of Noh theater. Both drums are struck using the fingers; players can also adjust pitch by manually applying pressure to the ropes on the drum. The color of the cords of these drums also indicates the skill of the musician: Orange and red for amateur players, light blue for performers with expertise, and lilac for masters of the instrument. \"Nagauta-shime daiko\" or \"uta daiko\" are also featured in Noh performance.\nMany taiko in Noh are also featured in kabuki performance and are used in a similar manner. In addition to the \"\u014d-tsuzumi\", \"ko-tsuzumi\", and \"nagauta-shime daiko\", Kabuki performances make use of the larger \"\u014d-daiko\" offstage to help set the atmosphere for different scenes.\nConstruction.\nProcess.\nTaiko construction has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning the skin to the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, \"by\u014d-uchi-daiko\" were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; the texture of the wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.\nThe skins or heads of taiko are generally made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged about three or four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called \"by\u014d\", are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; \"ch\u016b-daiko\" require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.\nDrum makers.\nSeveral companies specialize in the production of taiko. One such company that created drums exclusively for the Emperor of Japan, Miyamoto Unosuke Shoten in Tokyo, has been making taiko since 1861. The Asano Taiko Corporation is another major taiko-producing organization, and has been producing taiko for over 400 years. The family-owned business started in Matt\u014d, Ishikawa, and, aside from military equipment, made taiko for Noh theater and later expanded to creating instruments for festivals during the Meiji period. Asano currently maintains an entire complex of large buildings referred to as Asano Taiko Village, and the company reports producing up to 8000 drums each year. As of 2012, there is approximately one major taiko production company in each prefecture of Japan, with some regions having several companies. Of the manufacturers in Naniwa, Taikoya Matab\u0113 is one of the most successful and is thought to have brought considerable recognition to the community and attracted many drum makers there. Umetsu Daiko, a company that operates in Hakata, has been producing taiko since 1821.\nPerformance.\nTaiko performance styles vary widely across groups in terms of the number of performers, repertoire, instrument choices, and stage techniques. Nevertheless, a number of early groups have had broad influence on the tradition. For instance, many pieces developed by Ondekoza and Kodo are considered standard in many taiko groups.\nForm.\nKata is the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The notion is similar to that of kata in martial arts: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Shawn Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.\nSome groups in Japan, particularly those active in Tokyo, also emphasize the importance of the lively and spirited \"iki\" aesthetic. In taiko, it refers to very specific kinds of movement while performing that evoke the sophistication stemming from the mercantile and artisan classes active during the Edo period (1603\u20131868).\nThe sticks for playing taiko are called \"bachi\", and are made in various sizes and from different kinds of wood such as white oak, bamboo, and Japanese magnolia. \"Bachi\" are also held in a number of different styles. In \"kumi-daiko\", it is common for a player to hold their sticks in a relaxed manner between the V-shape of the index finger and thumb, which points to the player. There are other grips that allow performers to play much more technically difficult rhythms, such as the \"shime\" grip, which is similar to a matched grip: the \"bachi\" are gripped at the back end, and the fulcrum rests between the performer's index finger and thumb, while the other fingers remain relaxed and slightly curled around the stick.\nPerformance in some groups is also guided by principles based on Zen Buddhism. For instance, among other concepts, the San Francisco Taiko Dojo is guided by emphasizing communication, respect, and harmony. The way the \"bachi\" are held can also be significant; for some groups, \"bachi\" represent a spiritual link between the body and the sky. Some physical parts of taiko, like the drum body, its skin, and the tacks also hold symbolic significance in Buddhism.\nInstrumentation.\n\"Kumi-daiko\" groups consist primarily of percussive instruments where each of the drums plays a specific role. Of the different kinds of taiko, the most common in groups is the \"nagad\u014d-daiko\". \"Ch\u016b-daiko\" are common in taiko groups and represent the main rhythm of the group, whereas \"shime-daiko\" set and change tempo. A \"shime-daiko\" often plays the Jiuchi, a base rhythm holding together the ensemble. \"\u014c-daiko\" provide a steady, underlying pulse and serve as a counter-rhythm to the other parts. It is common for performances to begin with a single stroke roll called an \"\". The player starts slowly, leaving considerable space between strikes, gradually shortening the interval between hits, until the drummer is playing a rapid roll of hits. Oroshi are also played as a part of theatrical performance, such as in Noh theater.\nDrums are not the only instruments played in the ensemble; other Japanese instruments are also used. Other kinds of percussion instruments include the , a hand-sized gong played with a small mallet. In kabuki, the shamisen, a plucked string instrument, often accompanies taiko during the theatrical performance. \"Kumi-daiko\" performances can also feature woodwinds such as the shakuhachi and the shinobue.\nVoiced calls or shouts called kakegoe and kiai are also common in taiko performance. They are used as encouragement to other players or cues for transition or change in dynamics such as an increase in tempo. In contrast, the philosophical concept of ma, or the space between drum strikes, is also important in shaping rhythmic phrases and creating appropriate contrast.\nClothing.\nThere is a wide variety of traditional clothing that players wear during taiko performance. Common in many \"kumi-daiko\" groups is the use of the happi, a decorative, thin-fabric coat, and traditional headbands called hachimaki. Tabi, , and are also typical. During his time with the group Ondekoza, Eitetsu Hayashi suggested that a loincloth called a fundoshi be worn when performing for French fashion designer Pierre Cardin, who saw Ondekoza perform for him in 1975. The Japanese group Kodo has sometimes worn fundoshi for its performances.\nEducation.\nTaiko performance is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, such as in the 1512 encyclopedia called the \"Taigensho\", but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist William\u00a0P. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.\nOrally, patterns of onomatopoeia called kuchi sh\u014dga are taught from teacher to student that convey the rhythm and timbre of drum strikes for a particular piece. For example, represents a single strike to the center of the drum, where as represents two successive strikes, first by the right and then the left, and lasts the same amount of time as one \"don\" strike. Some taiko pieces, such as \"Yatai-bayashi\", include patterns that are difficult to represent in Western musical notation. The exact words used can also differ from region to region.\nMore recently, Japanese publications have emerged in an attempt to standardize taiko performance. The Nippon Taiko Foundation was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko. Daihachi Oguchi, the leader of the Foundation, wrote \"Japan Taiko\" with other teachers in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time. The instructional publication described the different drums used in \"kumi-daiko\" performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.\nThe system of fundamentals \"Japan Taiko\" put forward was not widely adopted because taiko performance varied substantially across Japan. An updated 2001 publication from the Foundation, called the , describes regional variations that depart from the main techniques taught in the textbook. The creators of the text maintained that mastering a set of prescribed basics should be compatible with learning local traditions.\nRegional styles.\nAside from \"kumi-daiko\" performance, a number of folk traditions that use taiko have been recognized in different regions in Japan. Some of these include from Sado Island, ' from the town of Kokura, and ' from Iwate Prefecture.\nEisa.\nA variety of folk dances originating from Okinawa, known collectively as eisa, often make use of the taiko. Some performers use drums while dancing, and generally speaking, perform in one of two styles: groups on the Yokatsu Peninsula and on Hamahiga Island use small, single-sided drums called whereas groups near the city of Okinawa generally use \"shime-daiko\". Use of \"shime-daiko\" over \"p\u0101ranku\" has spread throughout the island, and is considered the dominant style. Small \"nagad\u014d-daiko\", referred to as \"\u014d-daiko\" within the tradition, are also used and are worn in front of the performer. These drum dances are not limited to Okinawa and have appeared in places containing Okinawan communities such as in S\u00e3o Paulo, Hawaii, and large cities on the Japanese mainland.\nHachij\u014d-daiko.\n is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachij\u014d-jima. Two styles of \"Hachij\u014d-daiko\" emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.\nThe \"Hachij\u014d-daiko\" tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of \"Hachij\u014d-daiko\". These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one.\nThe first style of Hachij\u014d-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called \"Kumaoji-daiko\", named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. \"Kumaoji-daiko\" has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the , provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the , builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. \"Kumaoji-daiko\" also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.\nThe contemporary style of \"Hachij\u014d-daiko\" is called , which differs from \"Kumaoji-daiko\" in multiple ways. For instance, while the lead and accompanying roles are still present, \"shin-daiko\" performances use larger drums exclusively on stands. \"Shin-daiko\" emphasizes a more powerful sound, and consequently, performers use larger bachi made out of stronger wood. Looser clothing is worn by \"shin-daiko\" performers compared to kimono worn by \"Kumaoji-daiko\" performers; the looser clothing in \"shin-daiko\" allow performers to adopt more open stances and larger movements with the legs and arms. Rhythms used for the accompanying \"shita-by\u014dshi\" role can also differ. One type of rhythm, called \"y\u016bkichi\", consists of the following: \nThis rhythm is found in both styles, but is always played faster in \"shin-daiko\". Another type of rhythm, called \"honbadaki\", is unique to \"shin-daiko\" and also contains a song which is performed in standard Japanese.\nMiyake-daiko.\n is a style that has spread amongst groups through Kodo, and is formally known as . The word \"miyake\" comes from Miyake-jima, part of the Izu Islands, and the word \"Kamitsuki\" refers to the village where the tradition came from. Miyake-style taiko came out of performances for \u2014 a traditional festival held annually in July on Miyake Island since 1820 honoring the deity Gozu Tenn\u014d. In this festival, players perform on taiko while portable shrines are carried around town. The style itself is characterized in a number of ways. A \"nagad\u014d-daiko\" is typically set low to the ground and played by two performers, one on each side; instead of sitting, performers stand and hold a stance that is also very low to the ground, almost to the point of kneeling.\nOutside Japan.\nAustralia.\nTaiko groups in Australia began forming in the 1990s. The first group, called Ataru Taru Taiko, was formed in 1995 by Paulene Thomas, Harold Gent, and Kaomori Kamei. TaikOz was later formed by percussionist Ian Cleworth and Riley Lee, a former Ondekoza member, and has been performing in Australia since 1997. They are known for their work in generating interest in performing taiko among Australian audiences, such as by developing a complete education program with both formal and informal classes, and have a strong fan base. Cleworth and other members of the group have developed several original pieces.\nBrazil.\nThe introduction of \"kumi-daiko\" performance in Brazil can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s in S\u00e3o Paulo. Tangue Setsuko founded an eponymous taiko dojo and was Brazil's first taiko group; Setsuo Kinoshita later formed the group Wadaiko Sho. Brazilian groups have combined native and African drumming techniques with taiko performance. One such piece developed by Kinoshita is called \"Taiko de Samba\", which emphasizes both Brazilian and Japanese aesthetics in percussion traditions. Taiko was also popularized in Brazil from 2002 through the work of Yukihisa Oda, a Japanese native who visited Brazil several times through the Japan International Cooperation Agency.\nThe Brazilian Association of Taiko (ABT) suggests that there are about 150 taiko groups in Brazil and that about 10\u201315% of players are non-Japanese; Izumo Honda, coordinator of a large annual festival in S\u00e3o Paulo, estimated that about 60% of all taiko performers in Brazil are women.\nNorth America.\nTaiko emerged in the United States in the late 1960s. The first group, San Francisco Taiko Dojo, was formed in 1968 by Seiichi Tanaka, a postwar immigrant who studied taiko in Japan and brought the styles and teachings to the US. A year later, a few members of Senshin Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles led by its minister Masao Kodani initiated another group called Kinnara Taiko. San Jose Taiko later formed in 1973 in Japantown, San Jose, under Roy and PJ Hirabayashi. Taiko started to branch out to the eastern US in the late 1970s. This included formation of Denver Taiko in 1976 and Soh Daiko in New York City in 1979. Many of these early groups lacked the resources to equip each member with a drum and resorted to makeshift percussion materials such as rubber tires or creating taiko out of wine barrels.\nJapanese-Canadian taiko began in 1979 with Katari Taiko, and was inspired by the San Jose Taiko group. Its early membership was predominantly female. Katari Taiko and future groups were thought to represent an opportunity for younger, third-generation Japanese Canadians to explore their roots, redevelop a sense of ethnic community, and expand taiko into other musical traditions.\nThere are no official counts or estimates of the number of active taiko groups in the United States or Canada, as there is no governing body for taiko groups in either country. Unofficial estimates have been made. In 1989, there were as many as 30 groups in the US and Canada, seven of which were in California. One estimate suggested that around 120 groups were active in the US and Canada as of 2001, many of which could be traced to the San Francisco Taiko Dojo; later estimates in 2005 and 2006 suggested there were about 200 groups in the United States alone.\nThe Cirque du Soleil shows \"Myst\u00e8re\" in Las Vegas and \"Dralion\" have featured taiko performance. Taiko performance has also been featured in commercial productions such as the 2005 Mitsubishi Eclipse ad campaign, and in events such as the 2009 Academy Awards and 2011 Grammy Awards.\nFrom 2005 to 2006, the Japanese American National Museum held an exhibition called \"Big Drum: Taiko in the United States\". The exhibition covered several topics related to taiko in the United States, such as the formation of performance groups, their construction using available materials, and social movements. Visitors were able to play smaller drums.\nRelated cultural and social movements.\nCertain peoples have used taiko to advance social or cultural movements, both within Japan and elsewhere in the world.\nGender conventions.\nTaiko performance has frequently been viewed as an art form dominated by men. Historians of taiko argue that its performance comes from masculine traditions. Those who developed ensemble-style taiko in Japan were men, and through the influence of Ondekoza, the ideal taiko player was epitomized in images of the masculine peasant class, particularly through the character Muh\u014dmatsu in the 1958 film \"Rickshaw Man\". Masculine roots have also been attributed to perceived capacity for \"spectacular bodily performance\" where women's bodies are sometimes judged as unable to meet the physical demands of playing.\nBefore the 1980s, it was uncommon for Japanese women to perform on traditional instruments, including taiko, as their participation had been systematically restricted; an exception was the San Francisco Taiko Dojo under the guidance of Grand master Seiichi Tanaka, who was the first to admit females to the art form. In Ondekoza and in the early performances of Kodo, women performed only dance routines either during or between taiko performances. Thereafter, female participation in \"kumi-daiko\" started to rise dramatically, and by the 1990s, women equaled and possibly exceeded representation by men. While the proportion of women in taiko has become substantial, some have expressed concern that women still do not perform in the same roles as their male counterparts and that taiko performance continues to be a male-dominated profession. For instance, a member of Kodo was informed by the director of the group's apprentice program that women were permitted to play, but could only play \"as women\". Other women in the apprentice program recognized a gender disparity in performance roles, such as what pieces they were allowed to perform, or in physical terms based on a male standard.\nFemale taiko performance has also served as a response to gendered stereotypes of Japanese women as being quiet, subservient, or a femme fatale. Through performance, some groups believe they are helping to redefine not only the role of women in taiko, but how women are perceived more generally.\nBurakumin.\nThose involved in the construction of taiko are usually considered part of the burakumin, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working with leather or animal skins. Prejudice against this class dates back to the Tokugawa period in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face social discrimination, such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements. Drum makers have used their trade and success as a means to advocate for an end to discriminatory practices against their class.\nThe , representing the contributions of burakumin, is found in Naniwa Ward in Osaka, home to a large proportion of burakumin. Among other features, the road contains taiko-shaped benches representing their traditions in taiko manufacturing and leatherworking, and their influence on national culture. The road ends at the Osaka Human Rights Museum, which exhibits the history of systematic discrimination against the burakumin. The road and museum were developed in part due an advocacy campaign led by the Buraku Liberation League and a taiko group of younger performers called .\nNorth American \"sansei\".\nTaiko performance was an important part of cultural development by third-generation Japanese residents in North America, who are called \"sansei\". During World War II, second-generation Japanese residents, called \"nisei\" faced internment in the United States and in Canada on the basis of their race. During and after the war, Japanese residents were discouraged from activities such as speaking Japanese or forming ethnic communities. Subsequently, sansei could not engage in Japanese culture and instead were raised to assimilate into more normative activities. There were also prevailing stereotypes of Japanese people, which sansei sought to escape or subvert. During the 1960s in the United States, the civil rights movement influenced sansei to reexamine their heritage by engaging in Japanese culture in their communities; one such approach was through taiko performance. Groups such as San Jose Taiko were organized to fulfill a need for solidarity and to have a medium to express their experiences as Japanese-Americans. Later generations have adopted taiko in programs or workshops established by sansei; social scientist Hideyo Konagaya remarks that this attraction to taiko among other Japanese art forms may be due to its accessibility and energetic nature. Konagaya has also argued that the resurgence of taiko in the United States and Japan are differently motivated: in Japan, performance was meant to represent the need to recapture sacred traditions, while in the United States it was meant to be an explicit representation of masculinity and power in Japanese-American men.\nNotable performers and groups.\nA number of performers and groups, including several early leaders, have been recognized for their contributions to taiko performance. Daihachi Oguchi was best known for developing \"kumi-daiko\" performance. Oguchi founded the first \"kumi-daiko\" group called Osuwa Daiko in 1951, and facilitated the popularization of taiko performance groups in Japan.\nSeid\u014d Kobayashi is the leader of the Tokyo-based taiko group Oedo Sukeroku Taiko as of December 2014. Kobayashi founded the group in 1959 and was the first group to tour professionally. Kobayashi is considered a master performer of taiko. He is also known for asserting intellectual control of the group's performance style, which has influenced performance for many groups, particularly in North America.\nIn 1968, Seiichi Tanaka founded the San Francisco Taiko Dojo and is regarded as the Grandfather of Taiko and primary developer of taiko performance in the United States. He was a recipient of a 2001 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts and since 2013 is the only taiko professional presented with the Order of the Rising Sun 5th Order: Gold and Silver Rays by Emperor Akihito of Japan, in recognition of Grandmaster Seiichi Tanaka's contributions to the fostering of US-Japan relations as well as the promotion of Japanese cultural understanding in the United States.\nIn 1969, founded Ondekoza, a group well known for making taiko performance internationally visible and for its artistic contributions to the tradition. Den was also known for developing a communal living and training facility for Ondekoza on Sado Island in Japan, which had a reputation for its intensity and broad education programs in folklore and music.\nPerformers and groups beyond the early practitioners have also been noted. Eitetsu Hayashi is best known for his solo performance work. When he was 19, Hayashi joined Ondekoza, a group later expanded and re-founded as Kodo, one of the best known and most influential taiko performance groups in the world. Hayashi soon left the group to begin a solo career and has performed in venues such as Carnegie Hall in 1984, the first featured taiko performer there. He was awarded the 47th Education Minister's Art Encouragement Prize, a national award, in 1997 as well as the 8th Award for the Promotion of Traditional Japanese Culture from the Japan Arts Foundation in 2001."}

After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with \"Hello, I'm Dolly\", which led to success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with Porter Wagoner), before her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records. She has sold more than a hundred million records worldwide.\nParton's music includes Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach no.1 on the \"Billboard\" country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with Reba McEntire). She has 44 career Top10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career-charted singles over the past forty years. She has garnered ten Grammy Awards and fifty nominations, including the Lifetime Achievement Award and a 2020 Grammy Award with for KING &amp; COUNTRY for their collaboration on \"God Only Knows\"; ten Country Music Association Awards, including Entertainer of the Year and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award; five Academy of Country Music Awards, also including a nod for Entertainer of the Year; four People's Choice Awards; and three American Music Awards.\nIn 1999, Parton was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including \"I Will Always Love You\" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for Whitney Houston), \"Jolene\", \"Coat of Many Colors\", and \"9to5\". She is also in a select group to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, Tony Awards, and Emmy Awards. As an actress, she has starred in films such as \"9to5\" (1980) and \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" (1982), for which she earned Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress, as well as \"Rhinestone\" (1984), \"Steel Magnolias\" (1989), \"Straight Talk\" (1992) and \"Joyful Noise\" (2012).\nEarly life and career.\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the Little Pigeon River in Pittman Center, Tennessee. She is the fourth of twelve children born to Avie Lee Caroline (n\u00e9e Owens; 1923\u20132003) and Robert Lee Parton Sr. (1921\u20132000). As of January 2021, Parton has eight living siblings. Parton's middle name comes from her maternal great-great-grandmother Rebecca (Dunn) Whitted. Parton's father, known as \"Lee\", worked in the mountains of East Tennessee, first as a sharecropper and later tending his own small tobacco farm and acreage. He also worked construction jobs to supplement the farm's small income. Despite her father's illiteracy, Parton has often commented that he was one of the smartest people she had ever known in regards to business and making a profit.\nParton's mother, Avie Lee, cared for their large family. Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with Smoky Mountain folklore and ancient ballads. The songs were initially sung by immigrants moving from the British Isles to southern Appalachia over a century earlier. Avie Lee's father, Jake Owens, was a Pentecostal preacher, and Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly. Parton has long credited her father for her business savvy, and her mother's family for her musical abilities. When Parton was a small girl, her family moved from the Pittman Center area to a farm up on nearby Locust Ridge. Most of her cherished memories of youth happened there. The farm acreage and surrounding woodland inspired her to write the song \"My Tennessee Mountain Home\" in the 1970s. Years after her parents sold the property, Parton bought it back in the late 1980s and her brother Bobby helped with restoration and new construction.\nParton has described her family as being \"dirt poor\". Parton's father paid the doctor who helped deliver her with a bag of cornmeal. She outlined her family's poverty in her early songs \"Coat of Many Colors\" and \"In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)\". For six or seven years, Parton and her family lived in their rustic, one-bedroom cabin on their small subsistence farm on Locust Ridge. This was a predominately Pentecostal area located north of the Greenbrier Valley of the Great Smoky Mountains.\nMusic played an important role in her early life. She was brought up in the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), in a congregation her grandfather, Jake Robert Owens, pastored. Her earliest public performances were in the church, beginning at age six. At seven, she started playing a homemade guitar. When she was eight, her uncle bought her first real guitar.\nParton began performing as a child, singing on local radio and television programs in the East Tennessee area. By ten, she was appearing on \"The Cas Walker Show\" on both WIVK Radio and WBIR-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee. At 13, she was recording (the single \"Puppy Love\") on a small Louisiana label, Goldband Records, and appeared at the Grand Ole Opry, where she first met Johnny Cash, who encouraged her to follow her own instincts regarding her career.\nAfter graduating from Sevier County High School in 1964, Parton moved to Nashville the next day. Her initial success came as a songwriter, having signed with Combine Publishing shortly after her arrival; with her frequent songwriting partner, her uncle Bill Owens, she wrote several charting singles during this time, including two Top10 hits: Bill Phillips's \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\" (1966) and Skeeter Davis's \"Fuel to the Flame\" (1967). Her songs were recorded by many other artists during this period, including Kitty Wells and Hank Williams Jr. She signed with Monument Records in 1965, at age 19; she initially was pitched as a bubblegum pop singer. She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby\", did not crack the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.\nAfter her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\", as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by Curly Putman, one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy\", which went to number 17. The two songs appeared on her first full-length album, \"Hello, I'm Dolly\".\nMusic career.\n1967\u20131978: Country music success.\nIn 1967, musician and country music entertainer Porter Wagoner invited Parton to join his organization, offering her a regular spot on his weekly syndicated television program \"The Porter Wagoner Show\", and in his road show. As documented in her 1994 autobiography, initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that Norma Jean, the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience). With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, RCA Victor, to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a duet with Wagoner. That song, a remake of Tom Paxton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind\", released in late 1967, reached the country Top10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted Top10 singles for the pair.\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"Just Because I'm a Woman\", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the next two years, none of her solo effortseven \"In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)\", which later became a standardwere as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named Vocal Group of the Year in 1968 by the Country Music Association, but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par, the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.\nBy 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record Jimmie Rodgers' \"Mule Skinner Blues\", a gimmick that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, \"Joshua\". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hitsincluding her signature song \"Coat of Many Colors\" (number four, 1971)in addition to her duets. Top20 singles included \"The Right Combination\" and \"Burning the Midnight Oil\" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); \"Lost Forever in Your Kiss\" (with Wagoner), \"Touch Your Woman\" (1972), \"My Tennessee Mountain Home\" and \"Travelin' Man\" (1973).\nAlthough her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was \"Jolene\". Released in late 1973, it topped the country chart in February 1974 and reached the lower regions of the Hot 100 (it eventually also charted in the U.K., reaching number seven in 1976, representing Parton's first U.K. success). Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated. He helped produce her records through 1975. The pair continued to release duet albums, their final release being 1975's \"Say Forever You'll Be Mine\".\nIn 1974, her song, \"I Will Always Love You\", written about her professional break from Wagoner, went to number one on the country chart. Around the same time, Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to record the song. Parton was interested until Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song recorded by Presley. Parton refused. That decision has been credited with helping to make her many millions of dollars in royalties from the song over the years. Parton had three solo singles reach number one on the country chart in 1974 (\"Jolene\", \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"Love Is Like a Butterfly\"), as well as the duet with Porter Wagoner, \"Please Don't Stop Loving Me\". In a 2019 episode of the Sky Arts music series \"Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road\", Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she'd composed both \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson \"Buddy, that was a good night.\" Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with \"The Bargain Store\".\n1976\u20131986: Pop transition.\nBetween 1974 and 1980 Parton had a series of country hits, with eight singles reaching number one. Her influence on pop culture is reflected by the many performers covering her songs, including mainstream and crossover artists such as Olivia Newton-John, Emmylou Harris, and Linda Ronstadt.\nParton began to embark on a high-profile crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with Sandy Gallin, who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album \"All I Can Do\", which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, \"New Harvest...First Gathering\" (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs \u2013 the album contained covers of the pop and R&amp;B classics \"My Girl\" and \"Higher and Higher\" \u2013 and production. Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single \"Light of a Clear Blue Morning\" made much of an impression on the pop charts.\nAfter \"New Harvest\"'s disappointing crossover performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer Gary Klein for her next album. The result, 1977's \"Here You Come Again\", became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The Barry Mann-Cynthia Weil-penned title track topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first Top10 single on the pop chart (no.3). A second single, the double A-sided \"Two Doors Down\"/\"It's All Wrong, But It's All Right\" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-crossover success.\nIn 1978, Parton won a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her \"Here You Come Again\" album. She continued to have hits with \"Heartbreaker\" (1978), \"Baby I'm Burning\" (1979) and \"You're the Only One\" (1979)all of which charted in the pop Top\u00a040 and topped the country chart. \"Sweet Summer Lovin'\" (1979) became the first Parton single in two years to not top the country chart (though it did reach the Top10). During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a \"Barbara Walters Special\" in 1977 (timed to coincide with \"Here You Come Again\"'s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on Cher's ABC television special, and her own joint special with Carol Burnett on CBS, \"Carol and Dolly in Nashville\".\nParton served as one of three co-hosts (along with Roy Clark and Glen Campbell) on the CBS special \"Fifty Years of Country Music\". In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special \"The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music\", performed live at the Ford Theatre in Washington, D.C., and whose audience included President Jimmy Carter.\nHer commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the Donna Summer-written \"Starting Over Again\", \"Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You\", and \"9to5\", which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981, not to be confused with Sheena Easton's number-one hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, Morning Train (9 to 5). She had another Top10 single that year with \"Making Plans\", a single released from a 1980 reunion album with Porter Wagoner. \nThe theme song to the 1980 feature film \"9to5\", in which she starred along with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, not only reached number one on the country chartin February 1981 it reached number one on the pop and the adult-contemporary charts, giving her a triple number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had twelve Top10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of \"I Will Always Love You\", from the feature film \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" (1982) scraped the Top50 that year and her duet with Kenny Rogers, \"Islands in the Stream\" (written by the Bee Gees and produced by Barry Gibb), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.\nIn the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", \"Downtown\", \"Tennessee Homesick Blues\" (1984), \"Real Love\" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), \"Don't Call It Love\" (1985) and \"Think About Love\" (1986) all reaching the country Top10 (\"Tennessee Homesick Blues\" and \"Think About Love\" reached number one; \"Real Love\" also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit). However, RCA Records did not renew her contract after it expired in 1986, and she signed with Columbia Records in 1987.\n1987\u20132005: Country and bluegrass period.\nAlong with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, she released \"Trio\" (1987) to critical acclaim. The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on \"Billboard's\" Country Albums chart, and also reached the Top10 on \"Billboard\"'s Top200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top10 country hits, including Phil Spector's \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\", which went to number one. \"Trio\" won the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After a further attempt at pop success with \"Rainbow\" (1987), including the single \"The River Unbroken\", it ended up a commercial let-down, causing Parton to focus on recording country material. \"White Limozeen\" (1989) produced two number one hits in \"Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That\" and \"Yellow Roses\". Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the charts.\nA duet with Ricky Van Shelton, \"Rockin' Years\" (1991) reached number one, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded \"I Will Always Love You\" for the soundtrack of the feature film \"The Bodyguard\" (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, \"Straight Talk\", however, was less successful. But her 1993 album \"Slow Dancing with the Moon\" won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart. She recorded \"The Day I Fall in Love\" as a duet with James Ingram for the feature film \"Beethoven's 2nd\" (1993). The songwriters (Ingram, Carole Bayer Sager, and Clif Magness) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast. Similar to her earlier collaborative album with Harris and Ronstadt, Parton released \"Honky Tonk Angels\" in the fall of 1993 with Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette. It was certified as a gold album by the Recording Industry Association of America and helped revive both Wynette and Lynn's careers. Also in 1994, Parton contributed the song \"You Gotta Be My Baby\" to the AIDS benefit album \"Red Hot + Country\" produced by the Red Hot Organization. A live acoustic album, \"\", featuring stripped-down versions of some of her hits, as well as some traditional songs, was released in late 1994.\nParton's recorded music during the mid-to-late-1990s remained steady and somewhat eclectic. Her 1995 re-recording of \"I Will Always Love You\" (performed as a duet with Vince Gill), from her album \"Something Special\" won the Country Music Association's Vocal Event of the Year Award. The following year, \"Treasures\", an album of covers of 1960s/70s hits was released, and featured a diverse collection of material, including songs by Mac Davis, Pete Seeger, Kris Kristofferson, Cat Stevens, and Neil Young. Her recording of Stevens' \"Peace Train\" was later re-mixed and released as a dance single, reaching \"Billboard's \"dance singles chart. Her 1998 country-rock album \"Hungry Again\" was made up entirely of her own compositions. Although neither of the album's two singles, \"(Why Don't More Women Sing) Honky Tonk Songs\" and \"Salt in my Tears\", charted, videos for both songs received significant airplay on CMT. A second and more contemporary collaboration with Harris and Ronstadt, \"Trio II\", was released in early 1999. Its cover of Neil Young's song \"After the Gold Rush\" won a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Parton also was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999.\nParton recorded a series of bluegrass-inspired albums, beginning with \"The Grass Is Blue\" (1999), winning a Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album; and \"Little Sparrow\" (2001), with its cover of Collective Soul's \"Shine\" winning a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. The third, \"Halos &amp; Horns\" (2002) included a bluegrass version of the Led Zeppelin song \"Stairway to Heaven\". In 2005, she released \"Those Were The Days\" consisting of her interpretations of hits from the folk-rock era of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including \"Imagine\", \"Where Do the Children Play?\", \"Crimson and Clover\", and \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\"\n2005\u2013present: Touring and holiday album.\nParton earned her second Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for \"Travelin' Thru\", which she wrote specifically for the feature film \"Transamerica\". (2005) Due to the song's (and film's) acceptance of a transgender woman, Parton received death threats. She returned to number one on the country chart later in 2005 by lending her distinctive harmonies to the Brad Paisley ballad, \"When I Get Where I'm Going\". In September 2007, Parton released her first single from her own record company, Dolly Records, titled, \"Better Get to Livin'\", which eventually peaked at number 48 on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Country Songs chart. It was followed by the studio album \"Backwoods Barbie\", which was released on February 26, 2008, and reached number two on the country chart.

Parton received nominations for Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics, as well as a nomination for Tony Award for Best Original Score.\nDeveloping the musical was not a quick process. According to the public-radio program \"Studio 360\" (October 29, 2005), in October 2005 Parton was in the midst of composing the songs for a Broadway musical theater adaptation of the film.

Although Parton does not use Dean's surname professionally, she has stated that her passport reads \"Dolly Parton Dean\" and that she sometimes uses Dean when signing contracts.\nDean, who is retired from running an asphalt road-paving business in Nashville, has always shunned publicity and rarely accompanies his wife to any events. According to Parton, he has seen her perform only once. She also has said in interviews that, although it appears they spend little time together, it is simply that nobody sees him publicly. She has commented on Dean's romantic side, saying that he does spontaneous things to surprise her and sometimes even writes poems for her.

The association of breasts with Parton's public image is illustrated in the naming of Dolly the sheep after her, since the sheep was cloned from a cell taken from an adult ewe's mammary gland. In Mobile, Alabama, the General W.K. Wilson Jr. Bridge is commonly called \"the Dolly Parton Bridge\" due to its arches resembling her bust. The Hernando de Soto Bridge over the Mississippi River at Memphis is also sometimes called this for the same reason.\nParton is known for having undergone considerable plastic surgery. On a 2003 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", Winfrey asked what kind of cosmetic surgery Parton had undergone.

Nicki Minaj. When asked about future plastic surgeries, she famously said, \"If I see something saggin', baggin' or draggin', I'm gonna get it nipped, tucked or sucked.\" Parton's feminine escapism is acknowledged in her words, \"Womanhood was a difficult thing to get a grip on in those hills, unless you were a man.\"\nParton has been publicly vocal in her support for the LGBTQ+ community since at least 1991.\nPhilanthropy.\nSince the mid-1980s, Parton has supported many charitable efforts, particularly in the area of literacy, primarily through her Dollywood Foundation.\nHer literacy program, Dolly Parton's Imagination Library, a part of the Dollywood Foundation, mails one book per month to each enrolled child from the time of their birth until they enter kindergarten. Currently, over 1600 local communities provide the Imagination Library to almost 850,000 children each month across the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, and the Republic of Ireland. In 2018, Parton was honored by the Library of Congress on account of the \"charity sending out its 100 millionth book\".\nIn 2006, Parton published a cookbook, \"Dolly's Dixie Fixin's: Love, Laughter and Lots of Good Food\".\nThe Dollywood Foundation, funded from Parton's profits, has been noted for bringing jobs and tax revenues to a previously depressed region. Parton also has worked to raise money for several other causes, including the American Red Cross and HIV/AIDS-related charities.\nIn December 2006, Parton pledged $500,000 toward a proposed $90million hospital and cancer center to be constructed in Sevierville in the name of Robert F. Thomas, the physician who delivered her. She announced a benefit concert to raise additional funds for the project. The concert played to about 8,000 people.

During the ceremony, she received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the university. It was only the second honorary degree given by the university, and in presenting the degree, the university's Chancellor, Jimmy G. Cheek, said, \"Because of her career not just as a musician and entertainer, but for her role as a cultural ambassador, philanthropist and lifelong advocate for education, it is fitting that she be honored with an honorary degree from the flagship educational institution of her home state.\"\nIn response to the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, Parton was one of a number of country music artists who participated in a telethon to raise money for victims of the fires. This was held in Nashville on December 9.

She said that she was \"a very proud girl today to know I had anything at all to do with something that's going to help us through this crazy pandemic.\" In March 2021, Parton was vaccinated against COVID-19 at Vanderbilt University. She strongly encouraged everyone to get vaccinated when eligible and sang a song (an adaptation of Jolene) to celebrate her vaccination.

{"id": "8717", "revid": "30571117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8717", "title": "Diprotodon", "text": "Diprotodon is an extinct genus of gigantic quadrupedal marsupial native to Australia during the Pleistocene epoch. \nDiprotodon meaning in Greek \"two forward teeth\". The genus is currently considered monotypic, containing only Diprotodon optatum, the largest known marsupial to have ever existed. It is considered one of the core species of the \"Australian megafauna\", which ranged throughout the continent during the Pleistocene. \"Diprotodon\" existed from about 1.6 million years ago until extinction some 44,000 years ago. \n\"Diprotodon\" species fossils have been found in sites across mainland Australia, including complete skulls, skeletons, and foot impressions. The largest specimens were hippopotamus-sized: about from nose to tail, standing tall at the shoulder and weighing about . Diprotodons may have been depicted on Aboriginal rock art images in Quinkan traditional country (Queensland, Australia). \"Diprotodon\" became extinct sometime after 44,000 years ago, after the initial settlement of the continent; the role of human and climatic factors in its extinction are uncertain and contested.\n\"Diprotodon\" is a member of the extinct family Diprotodontidae. The closest surviving relatives of \"Diprotodon\" are the wombats and the koala, and so \"Diprotodon\" have sometimes been referred to as \"giant wombats\" in the popular press. Diprotodonts are suggested to have inspired legends of the bunyip, as some Aboriginal tribes identify \"Diprotodon\" bones as those of \"bunyips\".\nDiscovery.\nThe first recorded \"Diprotodon\" remains were discovered in a cave near Wellington, New South Wales, in the early 1830s by bushman George Ranken and Major Thomas Mitchell; the latter sent them to England for study by Sir Richard Owen. In the 1840s, Ludwig Leichhardt discovered many \"Diprotodon\" bones eroding from the banks of creeks in the Darling Downs of Queensland, and when reporting the find to Owen, commented that the remains were so well preserved, he expected to find living examples in the then-unexplored central regions of Australia.\nThe majority of fossil finds are of demographic groups indicative of diprotodonts dying in drought conditions. For example, hundreds of individuals were found in Lake Callabonna with well-preserved lower bodies, but crushed and distorted heads. Several family groups are thought to have sunk in mud while crossing the drying lake bed. Other finds consist of age groupings of young or old animals, which are first to die during a drought.\nIn 2012, a significant group of about 40 was found at Eulo, south-west Queensland.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Diprotodon\" was named by Owen (1838). It was assigned to the Diprotodontidae by McKenna and Bell (1997). The historical classification of \"Diprotodon\" consisted of eight species (\"D. optatum\" Owen, 1838; \"D. australis\" Owen, 1844; \"D. annextans\" McCoy, 1861; \"D. minor\" Huxley, 1862; \"D. longiceps\" McCoy 1865; \"D. loderi\" Krefft, 1873a; \"D. bennettii\" Krefft, 1873b (nec \"D. bennettii\" Owen, 1877); and \"D. bennettii\" Owen, 1877 (nec \"D. bennettii\" Krefft, 1873b); based on size or slight morphological differences of single specimens collected from isolated geographic regions. Bimodal dental sizes, rather than a continuum of tooth sizes, and identical male and female dental morphology, indicate sexual dimorphism instead of separate species, thus providing strong evidence that the eight species are synonyms for \"D. optatum\". \"Diprotodon\" is ultimately thought to have evolved from \"Euryzygoma dunensis\", a smaller diprotodontid known from the Pliocene of eastern Australia, and a smaller form of \"Diprotodon\", labelled \"D.\" ?\"optatum\", intermediate in size between the two taxa, is known from the Early Pleistocene (1.77\u20130.78 Ma) in Nelson Bay near Portland, Victoria.\nDescription.\n\"Diprotodon\" superficially resembled a giant wombat. The length of the skull of adult \"Diprotodon\" ranged between 65 cm and 1 m. In side view, the cranial profile is elongate and low. The zygomatic arch and flare laterally. Its feet turned inwards like a wombat's, giving it a pigeon-toed appearance. It had strong claws on the front feet and its pouch opening faced backwards.\nJohn Walter Gregory collected stories of mystical creatures in Aboriginal myths and legends and considered the possible connections between them and extinct species. He reported a story of a \"big, heavy land animal, with a single horn on its forehead\" as a possible reference to \"Diprotodon\"; the presence of a horn on the rostrum of the species is not scientifically acknowledged.\nThe skull of \"Diprotodon\" has large endocranial sinus cavities, which separate the relatively small cranial vault from the outer part of the skull. These significantly lighten the skull while providing large areas for muscle attachment and reduce load stress.\nPaleobiology.\nRecent research compared the variation between all of the described \"Diprotodon\" species with the variation in one of Australia's largest living marsupials, the eastern grey kangaroo, and found the range was comparable, with a near continent-wide distribution. This left only two possible \"Diprotodon\" species differing only in size with the smaller being around half the size of the larger. According to Gause's \"competitive exclusion principle\", no two species with identical ecological requirements can coexist in a stable environment. However, both the small and large diprotodonts coexisted throughout the Pleistocene and the size difference is similar to other sexually dimorphic living marsupials. Further evidence is the battle damage common in competing males found on the larger specimens, but absent from the smaller. Dental morphology also supports sexual dimorphism, with highly sexually dimorphic marsupials, such as the grey kangaroo, having different tooth sizes between males and females, but both sexes having the same dental morphology. An identical dental morphology occurs in the large and small \"Diprotodon\". The taxonomic implication is that Owen's original \"Diprotodon optatum\" is the only valid species.\nA single sexually dimorphic species allows behavioural interpretations. All sexually dimorphic species of over exhibit a polygynous breeding strategy. A modern example of this is the gender segregation of elephants, where females and the young form family groups, while lone males fight for the right to mate with all the females of the group. This behaviour is consistent with fossil finds where adult/juvenile fossil assemblages usually contain only female adult remains.\nCyclic variations in the strontium isotope ratios within the tooth enamel of a 300,000-year-old fossil imply that a population of \"Diprotodon\" undertook regular, seasonal migrations across the Darling Downs, making it the only known extinct or extant metatherian known to migrate annually. The carbon-13 enamel content was found to have little variation, suggesting a relatively consistent diet through the course of a year containing a mix of both C3 and C4 plants. A finite element method analysis of the skull estimated it had a bite force of around 4500 Newtons at the first molar to over 11,000 N at the fourth molar, values which were described as \"exceptionally high\", suggesting that \"Diprotodon\" was capable of processing tough, fibrous food.\nExtinction.\nSome modern researchers, including Richard Roberts and Tim Flannery, argue that diprotodonts, along with a wide range of other Australian megafauna, became extinct shortly after humans arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago. Others, including Steve Wroe, note that records in the Australian Pleistocene are rare, and there is not enough data to definitively determine the time of extinction of many of the species, with many of the species having no confirmed record within the last 100,000 years. They suggest that many of the extinctions had been staggered over the course of the late Middle Pleistocene and early Late Pleistocene, prior to human arrival, due to climatic stress. \"Diprotodon\" is one of several species with confirmed dates post-dating human arrival on the continent, with the latest high-reliability date being around 44,000 years Before Present.\nSome earlier researchers, including Richard Wright, argued on the contrary that diprotodont remains from several sites, such as Tambar Springs and Trinkey and Lime Springs, suggest that \"Diprotodon\" survived much longer, into the Holocene. Other more recent researchers, including Lesley Head and Judith Field, favour an extinction date of 28,000 to 30,000 years ago, which would mean that humans coexisted with \"Diprotodon\" for some 20,000 years. However, opponents of \"late extinction\" theories have interpreted such late dates based on indirect dating methods as artifacts resulting from redeposition of skeletal material into more recent strata, and recent direct dating results obtained with new technologies have tended to confirm this interpretation.\nThree theories have been advanced to explain the mass extinction.\nClimate change.\nAustralia, as with many other areas of the globe, underwent significant ecological change from predominantly forests to open landscapes during the late Neogene, in correlation with increased cooling. There has been considerable aridification of the Australian interior since the Late Miocene. The recent ice ages produced no significant glaciation in mainland Australia, but long periods of cold and increased aridification. These climatic changes have been suggested as a contributing factor in extinction.\nHuman hunting.\nThe overkill theory is that human hunters killed and ate the diprotodonts, causing their extinction. The extinctions appear to have coincided with the arrival of humans on the continent. Similar hunting-out happened with the megafauna of New Zealand, Madagascar, and many smaller islands around the world (such as New Caledonia, the Greater Antilles). Critics of this theory regard it as simplistic, arguing that (unlike New Zealand and America), little direct evidence of hunting has been found, and the dates on which the theory rests are too uncertain to be reliable. Linear striated cuts on a \"Diprotodon\" tooth from south-eastern Australia initially suggested to have been etched by people are now thought to be bite marks from a spotted\u2010tailed quoll. A partial juvenile radius of \"Diprotodon optatum\" over 47,000 years old was found at the Warratyi rock shelter in South Australia north of Adelaide. Due to the shelter's location on a steep escarpment and the lack of bite marks on the bone, it is thought that humans transported the bone to the site. At present, this represents the only known interaction between humans and \"Diprotodon\".\nAn examination of swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from Lynch's Crater in Queensland suggests that hunting may have been the primary cause of the extinction. Analysis of \"Sporormiella\" fungal spores (which are found in the dung of herbivores and are used as a proxy for their abundance) in the cores shows that the \"Spororniella\" records in that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago, at a time when climate changes were minimal; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal, and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant sclerophyll vegetation. The high-resolution chronology of the changes indicates that fire increased about a century after the disappearance of browsing megafauna, probably due to accumulation of fuel. Grass increased over the next several centuries; sclerophyll vegetation increased following a lag of another century, and a sclerophyll forest developed about a thousand years later. Earlier increases in sclerophyll vegetation during shifts to cooler, drier conditions about 120,000 and 75,000 years ago did not have any obvious impact on megafaunal abundance. A study on \"Sporormiella\" in cores going back 135,000 years at the Caledonia Fen wetland in Alpine National Park, found that \"Sporomiella\" levels rose after the end of the last interglacial, followed by a sharp drop around 76\u201360 kya, associated with an increased proportion of wetland plants and further grassland and herbfield; a second sharp drop was observed around 52\u201345 kya, suggested to represent the megafaunal extinction interval. Charcoal was found throughout the core, suggesting that the arrival of humans and the extinction of megafauna did not change the fire regime at this locality. However, the use of \"Sporormiella\" as a megafaunal proxy has been criticised, noting that \"Sporormiella\" is found sporadically in the dung of various herbivores, including extant emus and kangaroos, not just megafauna, its presence depends on a variety of factors, often unrelated to megafaunal abundance, and that in Cuddie Springs, a well known megafaunal site, the densities of \"Sporormiella\" were consistently low.\nHuman land management.\nThe third theory says that humans indirectly caused the extinction of diprotodonts by destroying the ecosystem on which they depended. In particular, early Aboriginal people are thought to have been fire-stick farmers using fire regularly and persistently to drive game, open up dense thickets of vegetation, and create fresh green regrowth for both humans and game animals to eat. Evidence for the fire hypothesis is the sudden increase in widespread ash deposits at the time that people arrived in Australia, as well as land-management and hunting practices of modern Aboriginal people as recorded by the earliest European settlers. Evidence against the hypothesis is the fact that humans appear to have eliminated the megafauna of Tasmania without using fire to modify the environment there."}

{"id": "8724", "revid": "102362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8724", "title": "Doppler effect", "text": "The Doppler effect (or the Doppler shift) is the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. It is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who described the phenomenon in 1842.\nA common example of Doppler shift is the change of pitch heard when a vehicle sounding a horn approaches and recedes from an observer. Compared to the emitted frequency, the received frequency is higher during the approach, identical at the instant of passing by, and lower during the recession.\nThe reason for the Doppler effect is that when the source of the waves is moving towards the observer, each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the crest of the previous wave. Therefore, each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave. Hence, the time between the arrivals of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an increase in the frequency. While they are traveling, the distance between successive wave fronts is reduced, so the waves \"bunch together\". Conversely, if the source of waves is moving away from the observer, each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave, so the arrival time between successive waves is increased, reducing the frequency. The distance between successive wave fronts is then increased, so the waves \"spread out\".\nFor waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium. Each of these effects is analyzed separately. For waves which do not require a medium, such as electromagnetic waves or gravitational waves, only the relative difference in velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered, giving rise to the relativistic Doppler effect.\nHistory.\nDoppler first proposed this effect in 1842 in his treatise \"\u00dcber das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels\" (On the coloured light of the binary stars and some other stars of the heavens). The hypothesis was tested for sound waves by Buys Ballot in 1845. He confirmed that the sound's pitch was higher than the emitted frequency when the sound source approached him, and lower than the emitted frequency when the sound source receded from him. Hippolyte Fizeau discovered independently the same phenomenon on electromagnetic waves in 1848 (in France, the effect is sometimes called \"effet Doppler-Fizeau\" but that name was not adopted by the rest of the world as Fizeau's discovery was six years after Doppler's proposal). In Britain, John Scott Russell made an experimental study of the Doppler effect (1848).\nGeneral.\nIn classical physics, where the speeds of source and the receiver relative to the medium are lower than the velocity of waves in the medium, the relationship between observed frequency formula_1 and emitted frequency formula_2 is given by:\nNote this relationship predicts that the frequency will decrease if either source or receiver is moving away from the other.\nEquivalently, under the assumption that the source is either directly approaching or receding from the observer:\nIf the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first heard is higher than the object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.\nIf the speeds formula_7 and formula_5 are small compared to the speed of the wave, the relationship between observed frequency formula_1 and emitted frequency formula_2 is approximately\nGiven formula_19\nwe divide for formula_6\nformula_21\nSince formula_22 we can substitute the geometric expansion:\nformula_23\nConsequences.\nWith an observer stationary relative to the medium, if a moving source is emitting waves with an actual frequency formula_2 (in this case, the wavelength is changed, the transmission velocity of the wave keeps constant; note that the \"transmission velocity\" of the wave does not depend on the \"velocity of the source\"), then the observer detects waves with a frequency formula_1 given by\nA similar analysis for a moving \"observer\" and a stationary source (in this case, the wavelength keeps constant, but due to the motion, the rate at which the observer receives waves and hence the \"transmission velocity\" of the wave [with respect to the observer] is changed) yields the observed frequency:\nA similar analysis for a moving \"observer\" and a moving source (in this case, the wavelength keeps constant, but due to the motion, the rate at which the observer receives waves and hence the \"transmission velocity\" of the wave [with respect to the observer] is changed) yields the observed frequency:\nAssuming a stationary observer and a source moving at the speed of sound, the Doppler equation predicts a perceived momentary infinite frequency by an observer in front of a source traveling at the speed of sound. All the peaks are at the same place, so the wavelength is zero and the frequency is infinite. This overlay of all the waves produces a shock wave which for sound waves is known as a sonic boom.\nWhen the source moves faster than the wave speed the source outruns the wave. The equation can give negative frequency values, but -500 Hz is pretty much the same as +500 Hz as far as an observer is concerned. \nLord Rayleigh predicted the following effect in his classic book on sound: if the source is moving toward the observer at twice the speed of sound, a musical piece emitted by that source would be heard in correct time and tune, but \"backwards\". The Doppler effect with sound is only clearly heard with objects moving at high speed, as change in frequency of musical tone involves a speed of around 40 meters per second, and smaller changes in frequency can easily be confused by changes in the amplitude of the sounds from moving emitters. Neil A Downie has demonstrated how the Doppler effect can be made much more easily audible by using an ultrasonic (e.g. 40\u00a0kHz) emitter on the moving object. The observer then uses a heterodyne frequency converter, as used in many bat detectors, to listen to a band around 40\u00a0kHz. In this case, with the bat detector tuned to give frequency for the stationary emitter of 2000\u00a0Hz, the observer will perceive a frequency shift of a whole tone, 240\u00a0Hz, if the emitter travels at 2 meters per second.\nApplications.\nAcoustic Doppler current profiler.\nAn acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) is a hydroacoustic current meter similar to a sonar, used to measure water current velocities over a depth range using the Doppler effect of sound waves scattered back from particles within the water column. The term ADCP is a generic term for all acoustic current profilers, although the abbreviation originates from an instrument series introduced by RD Instruments in the 1980s. The working frequencies range of ADCPs range from 38\u00a0kHz to several Megahertz. The device used in the air for wind speed profiling using sound is known as SODAR and works with the same underlying principles.\nRobotics.\nDynamic real-time path planning in robotics to aid the movement of robots in a sophisticated environment with moving obstacles often take help of Doppler effect. Such applications are specially used for competitive robotics where the environment is constantly changing, such as robosoccer.\nSirens.\nA siren on a passing emergency vehicle will start out higher than its stationary pitch, slide down as it passes, and continue lower than its stationary pitch as it recedes from the observer. Astronomer John Dobson explained the effect thus:\nIn other words, if the siren approached the observer directly, the pitch would remain constant, at a higher than stationary pitch, until the vehicle hit him, and then immediately jump to a new lower pitch. Because the vehicle passes by the observer, the radial velocity does not remain constant, but instead varies as a function of the angle between his line of sight and the siren's velocity:\nwhere formula_30 is the angle between the object's forward velocity and the line of sight from the object to the observer.\nAstronomy.\nThe Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves such as light is of great use in astronomy and results in either a so-called redshift or blueshift. It has been used to measure the speed at which stars and galaxies are approaching or receding from us; that is, their radial velocities. This may be used to detect if an apparently single star is, in reality, a close binary, to measure the rotational speed of stars and galaxies, or to detect exoplanets. This redshift and blueshift happens on a very small scale. If an object was moving toward earth, there would not be a noticeable difference in visible light, to the unaided eye.\nNote that redshift is also used to measure the expansion of space, but that this is not truly a Doppler effect. Rather, redshifting due to the expansion of space is known as cosmological redshift, which can be derived purely from the Robertson-Walker metric under the formalism of General Relativity. Having said this, it also happens that there \"are\" detectable Doppler effects on cosmological scales, which, if incorrectly interpreted as cosmological in origin, lead to the observation of redshift-space distortions.\nThe use of the Doppler effect for light in astronomy depends on our knowledge that the spectra of stars are not homogeneous. They exhibit absorption lines at well defined frequencies that are correlated with the energies required to excite electrons in various elements from one level to another. The Doppler effect is recognizable in the fact that the absorption lines are not always at the frequencies that are obtained from the spectrum of a stationary light source. Since blue light has a higher frequency than red light, the spectral lines of an approaching astronomical light source exhibit a blueshift and those of a receding astronomical light source exhibit a redshift.\nAmong the nearby stars, the largest radial velocities with respect to the Sun are +308\u00a0km/s (BD-15\u00b04041, also known as LHS 52, 81.7 light-years away) and \u2212260\u00a0km/s (Woolley 9722, also known as Wolf 1106 and LHS 64, 78.2 light-years away). Positive radial velocity means the star is receding from the Sun, negative that it is approaching.\nRadar.\nThe Doppler effect is used in some types of radar, to measure the velocity of detected objects. A radar beam is fired at a moving target \u2014 e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists \u2014 as it approaches or recedes from the radar source. Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source. As each wave has to move farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength. In some situations, the radar beam is fired at the moving car as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength. In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car's velocity. Moreover, the proximity fuze, developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.\nBecause the doppler shift affects the wave incident upon the target as well as the wave reflected back to the radar, the change in frequency observed by a radar due to a target moving at relative velocity formula_31 is twice that from the same target emitting a wave:\nMedical.\nAn echocardiogram can, within certain limits, produce an accurate assessment of the direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the cardiac output. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.\nAlthough \"Doppler\" has become synonymous with \"velocity measurement\" in medical imaging, in many cases it is not the frequency shift (Doppler shift) of the received signal that is measured, but the phase shift (\"when\" the received signal arrives).\nVelocity measurements of blood flow are also used in other fields of medical ultrasonography, such as obstetric ultrasonography and neurology. Velocity measurement of blood flow in arteries and veins based on Doppler effect is an effective tool for diagnosis of vascular problems like stenosis.\nFlow measurement.\nInstruments such as the laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV), and acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) have been developed to measure velocities in a fluid flow. The LDV emits a light beam and the ADV emits an ultrasonic acoustic burst, and measure the Doppler shift in wavelengths of reflections from particles moving with the flow. The actual flow is computed as a function of the water velocity and phase. This technique allows non-intrusive flow measurements, at high precision and high frequency.\nVelocity profile measurement.\nDeveloped originally for velocity measurements in medical applications (blood flow), Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) can measure in real time complete velocity profile in almost any liquids containing particles in suspension such as dust, gas bubbles, emulsions. Flows can be pulsating, oscillating, laminar or turbulent, stationary or transient. This technique is fully non-invasive.\nSatellites.\nSatellite navigation.\nThe Doppler shift can be exploited for satellite navigation such as in Transit and DORIS. \nSatellite communication.\nDoppler also needs to be compensated in satellite communication. \nFast moving satellites can have a Doppler shift of dozens of kilohertz relative to a ground station. The speed, thus magnitude of Doppler effect, changes due to earth curvature. Dynamic Doppler compensation, where the frequency of a signal is changed progressively during transmission, is used so the satellite receives a constant frequency signal. After realizing that the Doppler shift had not been considered before launch of the Huygens probe of the 2005 Cassini\u2013Huygens mission, the probe trajectory was altered to approach Titan in such a way that its transmissions traveled perpendicular to its direction of motion relative to Cassini, greatly reducing the Doppler shift.\nDoppler shift of the direct path can be estimated by the following formula:\nwhere formula_34 is the velocity of the mobile station, formula_35 is the wavelength of the carrier, formula_36 is the elevation angle of the satellite and formula_30 is the driving direction with respect to the satellite.\nThe additional Doppler shift due to the satellite moving can be described as:\nwhere formula_39 is the relative speed of the satellite.\nAudio.\nThe Leslie speaker, most commonly associated with and predominantly used with the famous Hammond organ, takes advantage of the Doppler effect by using an electric motor to rotate an acoustic horn around a loudspeaker, sending its sound in a circle. This results at the listener's ear in rapidly fluctuating frequencies of a keyboard note.\nVibration measurement.\nA laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is a non-contact instrument for measuring vibration. The laser beam from the LDV is directed at the surface of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.\nDevelopmental biology.\nDuring the segmentation of vertebrate embryos, waves of gene expression sweep across the presomitic mesoderm, the tissue from which the precursors of the vertebrae (somites) are formed. A new somite is formed upon arrival of a wave at the anterior end of the presomitic mesoderm. In zebrafish, it has been shown that the shortening of the presomitic mesoderm during segmentation leads to a Doppler effect as the anterior end of the tissue moves into the waves. This Doppler effect contributes to the period of segmentation.\nInverse Doppler effect.\nSince 1968 scientists such as Victor Veselago have speculated about the possibility of an inverse Doppler effect. The size of the Doppler shift depends on the refractive index of the medium a wave is traveling through. But some materials are capable of negative refraction, which should lead to a Doppler shift that works in a direction opposite that of a conventional Doppler shift. First experiment that detected this effect was conducted by Nigel Seddon and Trevor Bearpark in Bristol, United Kingdom in 2003. Later inverse Doppler effect was observed in some inhomogeneous materials and predicted inside Vavilov\u2013Cherenkov cone."}

{"id": "8727", "revid": "7328338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8727", "title": "\u0394T (timekeeping)", "text": "In precise timekeeping, \u0394\"T (Delta \"T, delta-\"T, delta\"T, or D\"T\") is a measure of the cumulative effect of the departure of the Earth's rotation period from the fixed-length day of atomic time. Formally it is the time difference obtained by subtracting Universal Time (UT, defined by the Earth's rotation) from Terrestrial Time (TT, independent of the Earth's rotation): . The value of \u0394T for the start of 1902 was approximately zero; for 2002 it was about 64 seconds. So the Earth's rotations over that century took about 64 seconds longer than would be required for days of atomic time. As well as this long-term drift in the length of the day there are short-term fluctuations in the length of day () which are dealt with separately.\nCalculation.\nThe Earth's rotational speed is , and a day corresponds to one period . A rotational acceleration gives a rate of change of the period of , which is usually expressed as . This has units of 1/time, and is commonly quoted as milliseconds-per-day per century (written as ms/day/cy, understood as (ms/day)/cy). Integrating gives an expression for \u0394\"T\" against time.\nUniversal time.\nUniversal Time is a time scale based on the Earth's rotation, which is somewhat irregular over short periods (days up to a century), thus any time based on it cannot have an accuracy better than 1 in 108. However, a larger, more consistent effect has been observed over many centuries: Earth's rate of rotation is inexorably slowing down. This observed change in the rate of rotation is attributable to two primary forces, one decreasing and one increasing the Earth's rate of rotation. Over the long term, the dominating force is tidal friction, which is slowing the rate of rotation, contributing about ms/day/cy or ms/cy, which is equal to the very small fractional change day/day. The most important force acting in the opposite direction, to speed up the rate, is believed to be a result of the melting of continental ice sheets at the end of the last glacial period. This removed their tremendous weight, allowing the land under them to begin to rebound upward in the polar regions, an effect that is still occurring today and will continue until isostatic equilibrium is reached. This \"post-glacial rebound\" brings mass closer to the rotational axis of the Earth, which makes the Earth spin faster, according to the law of conservation of angular momentum, similar to an ice skater pulling their arms in to spin faster. Models estimate this effect to contribute about \u22120.6\u00a0ms/day/cy. Combining these two effects, the net acceleration (actually a deceleration) of the rotation of the Earth, or the change in the length of the mean solar day (LOD), is +1.7\u00a0ms/day/cy or +62 s/cy2 or +46.5 ns/day2. This matches the average rate derived from astronomical records over the past 27 centuries.\nTerrestrial time.\nTerrestrial Time is a theoretical uniform time scale, defined to provide continuity with the former Ephemeris Time (ET). ET was an independent time-variable, proposed (and its adoption agreed) in the period 1948\u201352 with the intent of forming a gravitationally uniform time scale as far as was feasible at that time, and depending for its definition on Simon Newcomb's \"Tables of the Sun\" (1895), interpreted in a new way to accommodate certain observed discrepancies. Newcomb's tables formed the basis of all astronomical ephemerides of the Sun from 1900 through 1983: they were originally expressed (and published) in terms of Greenwich Mean Time and the mean solar day, but later, in respect of the period 1960\u20131983, they were treated as expressed in terms of ET, in accordance with the adopted ET proposal of 1948\u201352. ET, in turn, can now be seen (in light of modern results) as close to the average mean solar time between 1750 and 1890 (centered on 1820), because that was the period during which the observations on which Newcomb's tables were based were performed. While TT is strictly uniform (being based on the SI second, every second is the same as every other second), it is in practice realised by International Atomic Time (TAI) with an accuracy of about 1 part in 1014.\nEarth's rate of rotation.\nEarth's rate of rotation must be integrated to obtain time, which is Earth's angular position (specifically, the orientation of the meridian of Greenwich relative to the fictitious mean sun). Integrating +1.7\u00a0ms/d/cy and centering the resulting parabola on the year 1820 yields (to a first approximation) seconds for \u0394\"T\". Smoothed historical measurements of \u0394\"T\" using total solar eclipses are about +17190\u00a0s in the year \u2212500 (501\u00a0BC), +10580\u00a0s in 0 (1\u00a0BC), +5710\u00a0s in 500, +1570 s in 1000, and +200\u00a0 s in 1500. After the invention of the telescope, measurements were made by observing occultations of stars by the Moon, which allowed the derivation of more closely spaced and more accurate values for \u0394\"T\". \u0394\"T\" continued to decrease until it reached a plateau of +11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0s between 1680 and 1866. For about three decades immediately before 1902 it was negative, reaching \u22126.64\u00a0s. Then it increased to +63.83\u00a0s in January 2000 and +68.97\u00a0s in January 2018 and +69.361 s in January 2020, after even a slight decrease from 69.358 s in July 2019 to 69.338 s in September and October 2019 and a new increase in November and December 2019. This will require the addition of an ever-greater number of leap seconds to UTC as long as UTC tracks UT1 with one-second adjustments. (The SI second as now used for UTC, when adopted, was already a little shorter than the current value of the second of mean solar time.) Physically, the meridian of Greenwich in Universal Time is almost always to the east of the meridian in Terrestrial Time, both in the past and in the future. +17190\u00a0s or about \u00a0h corresponds to 71.625\u00b0E. This means that in the year \u2212500 (501\u00a0BC), Earth's faster rotation would cause a total solar eclipse to occur 71.625\u00b0 to the east of the location calculated using the uniform TT.\nValues prior to 1955.\nAll values of \u0394\"T\" before 1955 depend on observations of the Moon, either via eclipses or occultations. The angular momentum lost by the Earth due to friction induced by the Moon's tidal effect is transferred to the Moon, increasing its angular momentum, which means that its moment arm (approximately its distance from the Earth, i.e. precisely the semi-major axis of the Moon's orbit) is increased (for the time being about +3.8\u00a0cm/year), which via Kepler's laws of planetary motion causes the Moon to revolve around the Earth at a slower rate. The cited values of \u0394\"T\" assume that the lunar acceleration (actually a deceleration, that is a negative acceleration) due to this effect is = \u221226\u2033/cy2, where is the mean sidereal angular motion of the Moon. This is close to the best estimate for as of 2002 of \u221225.858\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003\u2033/cy2, so \u0394\"T\" need not be recalculated given the uncertainties and smoothing applied to its current values. Nowadays, UT is the observed orientation of the Earth relative to an inertial reference frame formed by extra-galactic radio sources, modified by an adopted ratio between sidereal time and solar time. Its measurement by several observatories is coordinated by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).\nGeological evidence.\nTidal deceleration rates have varied over the history of the Earth-Moon system. Analysis of layering in fossil mollusc shells from 70 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous period, shows that there were 372 days a year, and thus that the day was about 23.5 hours long then. Based on geological studies of \"tidal rhythmites,\" the day was 21.9\u00b10.4 hours long 620 million years ago and there were 13.1\u00b10.1 synodic months/year and 400\u00b17 solar days/year. The average recession rate of the Moon between then and now has been 2.17\u00b10.31\u00a0cm/year, which is about half the present rate. The present high rate may be due to near resonance between natural ocean frequencies and tidal frequencies."}

He is a Visiting Professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the Centre for Quantum Computation (CQC) in the Clarendon Laboratory of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of quantum computation by formulating a description for a quantum Turing machine, as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer. He has also proposed the use of entangled states and Bell's theorem for quantum key distribution and is a proponent of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nEarly life and education.\nDeutsch was born into a Jewish family in Haifa in Israel on 18 May 1953, the son of Oskar and Tikva Deutsch. David attended Geneva House school in Cricklewood (his parents owned and ran the Alma restaurant on Cricklewood Broadway, NW2), followed by The William Ellis School in Highgate (then a voluntary aided school in north London) before reading Natural Sciences at Clare College, Cambridge and taking Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. He went on to Wolfson College, Oxford for his doctorate in theoretical physics and wrote his thesis on quantum field theory in curved space-time supervised by Dennis Sciama and Philip Candelas.\nCareer and research.\nHis work on quantum algorithms began with a 1985 paper, later expanded in 1992 along with Richard Jozsa to produce the Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm, one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm. In his 1985 paper, he also suggests the use of entangled states and Bell's theorem for quantum key distribution. In his nomination for election as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2008, his contributions were described as:\n\"[having] laid the foundations of the quantum theory of computation, and has subsequently made or participated in many of the most important advances in the field, including the discovery of the first quantum algorithms, the theory of quantum logic gates and quantum computational networks, the first quantum error-correction scheme, and several fundamental quantum universality results. He has set the agenda for worldwide research efforts in this new, interdisciplinary field, made progress in understanding its philosophical implications (via a variant of the many-universes interpretation) and made it comprehensible to the general public, notably in his book The Fabric of Reality.\"\nSince 2012, he has been working on constructor theory, an attempt at generalizing the quantum theory of computation to cover not just computation but all physical processes. Together with Chiara Marletto, he published a paper in December 2014 entitled \"Constructor theory of information\", that conjectures that information can be expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible.\n\"The Fabric of Reality\".\nIn his 1997 book \"The Fabric of Reality\", Deutsch details his \"Theory of Everything\". It aims not at the reduction of everything to particle physics, but rather mutual support among multiversal, computational, epistemological, and evolutionary principles. His theory of everything is somewhat emergentist rather than reductive. There are four strands to his theory:\nInvariants.\nIn 2009, Deutsch expounded a new criterion for scientific explanation, which is to formulate invariants: 'State an explanation [publicly, so that it can be dated and verified by others later] that remains invariant [in the face of apparent change, new information, or unexpected conditions]'.\n\"The Beginning of Infinity\".\nDeutsch's second book, \"The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World\", was published on 31 March 2011. In this book, Deutsch views the Enlightenment of the 18th century as near the beginning of a potentially unending sequence of purposeful knowledge creation. He examines the nature of memes and how and why creativity evolved in humans.\nAwards and honours.\n\"The Fabric of Reality\" was shortlisted for the Rhone-Poulenc science book award in 1998. \nDeutsch was awarded the Dirac Prize of the Institute of Physics in 1998, and the Edge of Computation Science Prize in 2005. In 2017, he received the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). Deutsch is related to Paul Dirac through his doctoral advisor Dennis Sciama, whose doctoral advisor was Dirac. Deutsch was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2008. In 2020 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Cybernetics Society. In 2018, he received the Micius Quantum Prize.\nPersonal life.\nDeutsch is an atheist. He is also a founding member of the parenting and educational method known as Taking Children Seriously."}
{"id": "8730", "revid": "18162346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8730", "title": "Volkssturm", "text": "The Volkssturm (, \"people's storm\") was a national militia established by Nazi Germany during the last months of World War II. It was not set up by the German Army, the ground component of the combined German \"Wehrmacht\" armed forces, but by the Nazi Party on the orders of Adolf Hitler and established on 25 September 1944. It was staffed by conscripting males between the ages of 16 and 60 years, who were not already serving in some military unit. The \"Volkssturm\" comprised one of the final components of the total war promulgated by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, part of a Nazi endeavor to overcome their enemies' military strength through force of will. \"Volkssturm\" units fought unsuccessful futile battles against the Allied forces at the end of the war and on several occasions, its members participated in atrocities accompanied by German civilians, and the Hitler Youth, which were overseen by members of the SS or Gau leaders. \nOrigins and organization.\nThe new \"Volkssturm\" drew inspiration from the old Prussian \"Landsturm\" of 1813\u20131815, that fought in the liberation wars against Napoleon, mainly as guerrilla forces. Plans to form a \"Landsturm\" national militia in eastern Germany as a last resort to boost fighting strength were first proposed in 1944 by General Heinz Guderian, chief of the General Staff. The Army did not have enough men to resist the Soviet onslaught. So, additional categories of men were called into service, including those in non-essential jobs, those previously deemed unfit, over-age, or under-age, and those recovering from wounds. The \"Volkssturm\" had existed, on paper, since around 1925, but it was only after Hitler ordered Martin Bormann to recruit six million men for this militia that the group became a physical reality. While the regime formally established the \"Volkssturm\" on 25 September, it was not announced to the public until 16 October 1944. Despite the appeal for this last-ditch effort, the intended strength of \"six million\" members was never attained.\nJoseph Goebbels and other propagandists depicted the \"Volkssturm\" as an outburst of enthusiasm and the will to resist. Historian Daniel Blatman writes that the \"Volkssturm\" was portrayed as the \"incarnation\" of the greater \"Volksgemeinschaft\", whereby \"all differences in social status, origin, or age and unite all people on the basis of race. It was the service framework for members of the local community, who had been raised together and lived side by side, and now bore arms together in order to defend the community.\" In some regards, the \"Volkssturm\" was the culmination of Goebbels' \"total war\" speech of February 1943 and its formation was \"given a big build-up\" in the November 1944 newsreel episode of \"Die Deutsche Wochenschau\". Consistent messages of final victory from various Nazi media outlets accompanying the \"Volkssturm's\" creation provided a psychological rallying point for the civilian population. While it had some marginal effect on morale, it was undermined by the recruits' visible lack of uniforms and weaponry. Nazi themes of death, transcendence, and commemoration were given full play to encourage the fight. Many German civilians realized that this was a desperate attempt to turn the course of the war. Sardonic old men would remark, \"We old monkeys are the F\u00fchrer\u2019s newest weapon\" (in German this rhymes: \"Wir alten Affen sind des F\u00fchrers neue Waffen\"). A popular joke about the \"Volkssturm\" went \"Why is the \"Volkssturm\" Germany's most precious resource? Because its members have silver in their hair, gold in their mouths, and lead in their bones.\"\nFor these militia units to be effective, they needed not only strength in numbers, but also fanaticism. During the early stages of \"Volkssturm\" planning, it became apparent that units lacking morale would lack combat effectiveness. To generate fanaticism, \"Volkssturm\" units were placed under direct command of the local Nazi party officials, the \"Gauleiter\" and \"Kreisleiter\". The new \"Volkssturm\" was also to become a nationwide organization, with Heinrich Himmler, as Replacement Army commander, responsible for armament and training. Though nominally under party control, \"Volkssturm\" units were placed under \"Wehrmacht\" command when engaged in action. Aware that a \"people's army\" would not be able to withstand the onslaught of the modern army wielded by the Allies, Hitler issued the following order towards the end of 1944:\n Experience in the East has shown that \"Volkssturm\", emergency and reserve units have little fighting value when left to themselves, and can be quickly destroyed. The fighting value of these units, which are for the most part strong in numbers, but weak in the armaments required for modern battle, is immeasurably higher when they go into action with troops of the regular army in the field. I, therefore, order: where \"Volkssturm\", emergency, and reserve units are available, together with regular units, in any battle sector, mixed battle-groups (brigades) will be formed under unified command, so as to give the \"Volkssturm\", emergency, and reserve units stiffening and support.\nWith the Nazi Party in charge of organizing the \"Volkssturm\", each \"Gauleiter\", or Nazi Party District Leader, was charged with the leadership, enrollment, and organization of the \"Volkssturm\" in their district. The largest \"Volkssturm\" unit seems to have corresponded to the next smaller territorial subdivision of the Nazi Party organization\u2014the \"Kreis\". The basic unit was a battalion of 642 men. Units were mostly composed of members of the Hitler Youth, invalids, the elderly, or men who had previously been considered unfit for military service. On 12 February 1945, the Nazis conscripted German women and girls into the auxiliaries of the \"Volkssturm\". Correspondingly, girls as young as 14 years were trained in the use of small arms, panzerfaust, machine guns, and hand grenades from December 1944 through May 1945.\nMunicipal organization:\nEach \"Gauleiter\" and \"Kreisleiter\" had a \"Volkssturm\" Chief of Staff.\nFrom the militia's inception until the spring of 1945, Himmler and Bormann engaged in a power-struggle over the jurisdictional control over the \"Volkssturm\" regarding security and police powers in Germany and the occupied territories; a contest which Himmler and his SS more or less won on one level (police and security), but lost to Bormann on another (mobilizing reserve forces). Historian David Yelton described the situation as two ranking officers at the helm of a sinking ship fighting over command.\nBenito Mussolini suggested, through his son Vittorio, then general secretary of the Republican Fascist party's German branch, that 30,000 Italians should be added to the \"Volkssturm\" in defense of Germany. However, no evidence exists that this offer was implemented.\nUniforms and insignia.\nThe \"Volkssturm\" \"uniform\" was only a black armband with the German words \"Deutscher Volkssturm Wehrmacht\" (\"German People's Storm Armed Forces\"). The German government tried to issue as many of its members as possible with military uniforms of all sorts, ranging from \"Feldgrau\" to camouflage types. A telling example of the \"Volkssturm's\" piecemeal outfitting occurred in the Rhineland, where one unit was provided with \"pre-war black SS uniforms, brown Organization Todt coats, blue Air Force auxiliary caps, and French steel helmets.\" Most members of the \"Volkssturm\", especially elderly members, had no uniform and were not supplied, so they generally wore either work uniforms (including railway workers, policemen and firemen) or their civilian clothing and usually carried with them their own personal rucksacks, blankets, cooking-equipment, etc.\nRanks.\nThe simple paramilitary insignia of the \"Volkssturm\" were as follows:\nTraining and impact.\nTypically, members of the \"Volkssturm\" received only very basic military training. It included a brief indoctrination and training on the use of basic weapons such as the Karabiner 98k rifle and \"Panzerfaust\". Because of continuous fighting and weapon shortages, weapon training was often minimal. There was also a lack of instructors, meaning that weapons training was sometimes done by World War I veterans drafted into service themselves. Often \"Volkssturm\" members were only able to familiarize themselves with their weapons when in actual combat.\nThere was no standardization of any kind and units were issued only what equipment was available. This was true of every form of equipment\u2014\"Volkssturm\" members were required to bring their own uniforms and culinary equipment etc. This resulted in the units looking very ragged and, instead of boosting civilian morale, it often reminded people of Germany's desperate state. Armament was equally haphazard: though some Karabiner 98ks were on hand, members were also issued older Gewehr 98s and 19th-century Gewehr 71s and Steyr-Mannlicher M1888s, as well as Dreyse M1907 pistols. In addition there was a plethora of Soviet, British, Belgian, French, Italian, and other weapons that had been captured by German forces during the war. The Germans had also developed cheap but reasonably effective \"Volkssturm\" weapons, such as MP 3008 machine pistols and \"Volkssturmgewehr\" rifles. These were completely stamped and machine-pressed constructions (in the 1940s, industrial processes were much cruder than today, so a firearm needed great amounts of semi-artisanal work to be actually reliable). The \"Volkssturm\" troops were nominally supplied when and where possible by both the \"Wehrmacht\" and the SS. By the end of January 1945, the \"Volkssturm\" had only accumulated 40,500 rifles and 2,900 machine guns amid this mish-mash of foreign and outdated assemblage of weapons.\nWhen units had completed their training and received armament, members took a customary oath to Hitler and were then dispatched into combat. Teenagers and middle-aged men were sent to separate training camps, some of whom received as little as ten to fourteen days of training before being sent to fight. Unlike most English-speaking countries, Germany had universal military service for all young men for several generations, so many of the older members would have had at least basic military training from when they served in the German Army and many would have been veterans of the First World War. \"Volkssturm\" units were supposed to be used only in their own districts, but many were sent directly to the front lines. Ultimately, it was their charge to confront the overwhelming power of the British, Canadian, Soviet, American, and French armies alongside \"Wehrmacht\" forces to either turn the tide of the war or set a shining example for future generations of Germans and expunge the defeat of 1918 by fighting to the last, dying before surrendering. It was an apocalyptic goal which some of those assigned to the \"Volkssturm\" took to heart. Unremittingly fanatical members of the \"Volkssturm\" refused to abandon the Nazi ethos unto the dying days of Nazi Germany, and in a number of instances took brutal \"police actions\" against German civilians deemed defeatists or cowards.\nOn some occasions, members of the \"Volkssturm\" showed tremendous courage and a determined will to resist, more so even than soldiers in the \"Wehrmacht\". The \"Volkssturm\" battalion 25/235 for instance, started out with 400 men but fought on until there were only 10 men remaining. Fighting at K\u00fcstrin between 30 January to 29 March 1945, militia units made up mostly of the \"Volkssturm\" resisted for nearly two months. Losses were upwards of 60 percent for the \"Volkssturm\" at Kolberg, roughly 1900 of them died at Breslau, and during the Battle of K\u00f6nigsberg (Kaliningrad), another 2400 members of the \"Volkssturm\" were killed. At other times along the western front particularly, \"Volkssturm\" troops would cast their arms aside and disappear into the chaos. Youthful ardor and fanaticism among Hitler Youth members fighting with the \"Volkssturm\" or an insatiable sense of duty from old men proved tragic sometimes. An example shared by historian Stephen Fritz is instructive in this case:\nIn one representative village just north of Bad Windsheim, the Herbolzheim \"Volkssturm\" unit, with its customary composition of elderly men and young boys under the influence of a few regular army soldiers, foolishly declared the town a fortress and laid mines in the streets. As American troops approached in midmorning on April 12, shots from the village rang out. Angered, the Americans commenced a two-hour artillery barrage complemented by aerial attacks that gutted the town with incendiary and high-explosive bombs. With their village engulfed in flames, the civilian inhabitants, mostly the elderly, women, and children, fled in search of shelter to the surrounding fields, all the while under American fire.\nNot every \"Volkssturm\" unit was suicidal or apocalyptic in outlook as the war drew closer to its end. Many of them lost their enthusiasm for the fight when it became clear that the Allies had won, prompting them to lay down their weapons and surrender \u2013 they also feared being captured by Allied forces and tortured or executed as partisans. Duty to their communities and sparing them from horrors like at Bad Windsheim also played a part in their capitulation, as did self-preservation.\nBattle for Berlin.\nTheir most extensive use was during the Battle of Berlin, where \"Volkssturm\" units fought in many parts of the city. This battle was particularly devastating to its formations, however; many members fought to the death out of fear of being captured by the Soviets, holding out to the very end, which was in keeping with their covenant. The \"Volkssturm\" had a strength of about 60,000 in the Berlin area, formed into 92 battalions, of which about 30 battalions of \"Volkssturm I\" (those with some weapons) were sent to forward positions, while those of \"Volkssturm II\" (those without weapons) remained in the inner city. One of the few substantive fighting units left to defend Berlin was the LVI Panzer Corps, which occupied the southeastern sector of the town, whereas the remaining parts of the city were being defended by what remained of the SS, the \"Volkssturm\", and the Hitler Youth formations. Nonetheless, a force of over 2.5 million Soviet troops, equipped with 6,250 tanks and over 40,000 artillery pieces were assigned to capture the city, and the diminished remnants of the \"Wehrmacht\" were no match for them. Meanwhile, Hitler denounced every perceived \"betrayal\" to the inhabitants of the \"F\u00fchrerbunker\". Not eager to die what was thought to be a pointless death, many older members of the \"Volkssturm\" looked for places to hide from the approaching Soviet Army. Juxtaposed against the tragic image of Berlin holding out against all odds was the frequent exodus and capitulation of \"Wehrmacht\" soldiers and members of the \"Volkssturm\" in southern and western Germany.\nOne notable and unusual \"Volkssturm\" unit in the Battle for Berlin was the 3/115 Siemensstadt Battalion. It comprised 770 men, mainly First World War veterans in their 50s who were reasonably fit factory workers, with experienced officers. Unlike most \"Volkssturm\" units it was quite well equipped and trained. It was formed into three rifle companies, a support company (with two infantry support guns, four infantry mortars and heavy machine guns), and a heavy weapons company (with four Soviet M-20 howitzers and a French De Bange 220\u00a0mm mortar). The battalion first engaged Soviet troops at Friedrichsfelde on 21 April and saw the heaviest fighting over the following two days. It held out until 2 May, by which time it was down to just 50 rifles and two light machine guns. The survivors fell back to join other \"Volkssturm\" units. 26 men from the battalion were awarded the Iron Cross. Allied bombing and Soviet artillery had reduced Berlin to rubble; meanwhile the final stand in Berlin dwindled to fighting against highly trained, battle-hardened Soviet troops on the brink of final victory, who viewed resistance fighters like the \"Volkssturm\" as terrorists in much the same way the Wehrmacht once had viewed potential partisans during Operation Barbarossa. Red Army soldiers called the Hitler Youth formations and members of the \"Volkssturm\" still fighting to the end in Berlin \"totals\" for being part of Germany's total mobilization effort.\nRole in Atrocities.\nOn several occasions, members of the \"Volkssturm\" participated in atrocities. During January 1945, thousands of prisoners were evacuated and force-marched from several smaller concentrations camps\u2014which included Jesau, Seerappen, Schippenbeil, Gerdauen, and Helgenbeil\u2014near K\u00f6nigsberg, many dying along the way. Upon reaching Palmnicken some 2,500 to 3,000 prisoners of the 5,000 that originally began the journey, were lodged in a factory. Mayor and local Nazi party chief, Kurt Friedrichs, wanted the SS to send these prisoners on their way since the Red Army was not far away. When local \"Volkssturm\" leader Hans Feyerabend was ordered to transport the suffering prisoners out of the town, he refused to carry out the order and was heard exclaiming that he would not permit a massacre like the one at Katyn forest. Feyerabend even assigned \"Volkssturm\" guards to keep watch on the local Nazi party members, but this proved fruitless when Friedrich armed a group of Hitler Youth and likewise summoned the local SD elements, whose leaders then commanded the \"Volkssturm\" to help evacuate the prisoners. On 30 January 1945, after the \"Volkssturm\" left with Friedrich in charge, Feyerabend committed suicide; then between 30 January and 1 February the prisoners were murdered by the remaining assemblage of SS guards, Hitler Youth, and the local \"Volkssturm\" unit. \nWhen prisoners fell sick with typhus in the Styria Gau during February\u2013March 1945, SS men, Hitler Youth, and \"Volkssturm\" units systematically murdered them. Under the orders of Loeben-district Kreisleiter, Otto Christandl, \"Volkssturm\" units in nearby Graz and Eisenerz assisted the Gestapo and Ukrainian Waffen-SS men in evacuating between 6,000 and 8,000 prisoners\u2014being marched towards Mauthausen\u2014from their region, many of whom were murdered during the journey when they collapsed from exhaustion. \nSometime in early April 1945 as Allied forces approached the Mittelwerk facilities\u2014where V2 rockets were being produced\u2014the slave laborers from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp were force-marched from the western Harz by a collection of guards drawn from the military, the Hitler Youth, and the \"Volkssturm\". Approximately 40 kilometers north of Magdeburg in the village of Mieste, this motley assemblage of guards locked a thousand of these prisoners in a barn and burned them alive at the instruction of a local Nazi Party leader. At the town of Celle in Lower Saxony around the same time, members of the SS, SA, local police, Hitler Youth, and \"Volkssturm\" were aided by locals to \"hunt down and shoot\" prisoners who had fled into the local woodland after their transport train was bombed.\nInterrogated members of the \"Volkssturm\"\u2014when questioned as to where the regular forces had gone\u2014revealed that German soldiers surrendered to the Americans and British instead of the Red Army for fear of reprisals related to the atrocities they had committed in the Soviet Union.\nFinal phase.\nWhile Iron Crosses were being handed out in places like Berlin, other cities and towns like Parchim and Mecklenburg witnessed old elites, acting as military commandants over the Hitler Youth and \"Volkssturm\", asserting themselves and demanding that the defensive fighting stop so as to spare lives and property. Despite their efforts, the last four months of the war were an exercise in futility for the \"Volkssturm\", and the Nazi leadership's insistence to continue the fight to the bitter end contributed to an additional 1.23 million (approximated) deaths, half of them German military personnel and the other half from the \"Volkssturm\".\nIn many small towns, when leading members of the \"Volkssturn\" refused to fight on against the superior forces of the Allies\u2014part of an attempt to circumvent the \"total destruction\" of their home regions\u2014they were tried and \"summarily hung\" by party activists. Thousands were killed like this in Franken during the spring of 1945.\nSee also.\nOther nations:"}
{"id": "8731", "revid": "1012983776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8731", "title": "Director's cut", "text": "A director's cut is an edited version of a film (or television episode, music video, commercial, or video game) that is supposed to represent the director's own approved edit. \"Cut\" explicitly refers to the process of film editing; in preparing a film for release, the director's cut is preceded by the assembly and rough editor's cut and usually followed by the final cut meant for the public film release.\nDirector's cuts of film are not generally released to the public because on most films the director does not have the final cut privilege. Those with money invested in the film, such as the production companies, distributors, or studios, may make changes intended to make the film more profitable at the box office. This sometimes means a happier ending or less ambiguity, or excluding scenes that would earn a more audience-restricting rating, but more often means that the film is simply shortened to provide more screenings per day.\nWith the rise of home video, the phrase became more generically used as a marketing term (including mediums such as comic books and music albums, neither of which actually have directors), and the most commonly seen form of director's cut is a cut where extra scenes and characters are added in, often making the director's cut considerably longer than the final cut.\nOrigin of the phrase.\nTraditionally, the \"director's cut\" is not, by definition, the director's ideal or preferred cut. The editing process of a film is broken into stages: First is the assembly/rough cut, where all selected takes are put together in the order in which they should appear in the film. Next, the editor's cut is reduced from the rough cut; the editor may be guided by his own tastes or following notes from the director or producers. Eventually is the final cut, which actually gets released or broadcast. In between the editor's cut and the final cut can come any number of fine cuts, including the director's cut. The director's cut may include unsatisfactory takes, a preliminary soundtrack, a lack of desired pick-up shots etc., which the director would not like to be shown but uses as a placeholder until satisfactory replacements can be inserted. This is still how the term is used within the film industry, as well as commercials, television, and music videos.\nInception.\nThe trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the \"director's cut\" of \"The Wild Bunch\" was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences. The theatrical release of the film had cut ten minutes to get an R-rating, but this cut was hailed as superior and has now become the definitive one. Other early examples include George Lucas's first two films being re-released following the success of \"Star Wars\", in cuts which more closely resembled his vision, or Peter Bogdanovich re-cutting \"The Last Picture Show\" several times. Charlie Chaplin also re-released all of his films in the 1970s, several of which were re-cut (Chaplin's re-release of \"The Gold Rush\" in the 1940s is almost certainly the earliest prominent example of a director's re-cut film being released to the public). A theatrical re-release of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" used the phrase \"Special Edition\" to describe a cut which was closer to Spielberg's intent but had a compromised ending demanded by the studio. As the home video industry rose in the early 1980s, video releases of director's cuts were sometimes created for the small but dedicated cult fan market. Los Angeles cable station Z Channel is also cited as significant in the popularization of alternate cuts. Early examples of films released in this manner include Michael Cimino's \"Heaven's Gate\", where a longer cut was recalled from theaters but subsequently shown on cable and eventually released to home video; James Cameron's \"Aliens\", where a video release restored 20 minutes the studio had insisted on cutting; James Cameron's \"The Abyss\", where Cameron voluntarily made cuts to the theatrical version for pacing but restored them for a video release, and most famously, Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner\", where an alternate workprint version was released to fan acclaim, ultimately resulting in the 1992 recut, the first film to use the term \"Director's Cut\" as a marketing description (and the first time it was used to describe a cut that the director was not involved in preparing). Scott later recut the film once more, releasing a version dubbed \"The Final Cut\" in 2007. This was the final re-cut and the first in which Scott maintained creative control over the final product, leading to The Final Cut being considered the definitive version of the film.\nCriticism.\nOnce distributors discovered that consumers would buy alternate versions of films, it became common for films to receive multiple releases. There is no standardization for labelling, leading to so-called \"director's cuts\" of films despite where the director prefers the theatrically released version, or when the director had actual final cut privilege. These were often assembled by simply restoring deleted scenes, sometimes adding as much as a half-hour to the length of the film without regard to pacing and storytelling.\nAs a result, the \"director's cut\" is often considered a mixed bag, with an equal share of supporters and detractors (including Peter Jackson and James Cameron for the latter; each preferring the phrases \"special\" and \"extended\" edition). Roger Ebert approved of the use of the label in unsuccessful films that had been tampered with by studio executives, such as Sergio Leone's original cut of \"Once Upon a Time in America\", and the moderately successful theatrical version of \"Daredevil\", which were altered by studio interference for their theatrical release. Other well-received director's cuts include Ridley Scott's \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (with \"Empire\" magazine stating: \"The added 45 minutes in the Director\u2019s Cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle\"), or Sam Peckinpah's \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\", where the restored 115-minute cut is closer to the director's intent than the theatrical 105-minute cut (the actual director's cut was 122 minutes; it was never completed to Peckinpah's satisfaction, but was used as a guide for the restoration that was done after his death).\nSometimes the term is used a marketing ploy. For example, Ridley Scott states on the director's commentary track of \"Alien\" that the original theatrical release was his \"director's cut\", and that the new version was released as a marketing ploy. Director Peter Bogdanovich, no stranger to director's cuts himself, cites \"Red River\" as an example where \"MGM have a version of Howard Hawks's \"Red River\" that they're calling the Director's Cut and it is absolutely not the director's cut. It's a cut the director didn't want, an earlier cut that was junked. They assume because it was longer that it's a director's cut. Capra cut two reels off \"Lost Horizon\" because it didn't work and then someone tried to put it back. There are certainly mistakes and stupidities in reconstructing pictures.\"\nIn some instances, such as Peter Weir's \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\", Robert Wise's \"\", John Cassavetes's \"The Killing of a Chinese Bookie\", Blake Edwards's \"Darling Lili\" and Francis Ford Coppola's , changes made to a director's cut resulted in a very similar runtime or a shorter, more compact cut. This generally happens when a distributor insists that a film be completed to meet a release date, but sometimes it is the result of removing scenes that the distributor insisted on inserting, as opposed to restoring scenes they insisted on cutting.\nAnother way that released director's cuts can be compromised is when directors were never allowed to even shoot their vision, and thus when the film is re-cut, they must make do with the footage that exists. Examples of this include Terry Zwigoff's \"Bad Santa\", Brian Helgeland's \"Payback\", and most notably the Richard Donner re-cut of \"Superman II\". Donner completed about 75% of the shooting of the sequel during the shooting of the first one but was fired from the project. of the film includes, among other things, screen test footage of stars Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, footage used in the first film, and entire scenes that were shot by replacement director Richard Lester which Donner dislikes but were required for story purposes.\nExtended cuts and special editions.\nSpecial editions such as George Lucas's \"Star Wars\" films, and Steven Spielberg's \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", in which special effects are redone in addition to a new edit, have also caused controversy.\nExtended or special editions can also apply to films that have been extended for television or cut out to fill time slots and long advertisement breaks, against the explicit wishes of the director, such as the TV versions of \"Dune\" (1984), \"The Warriors\" (1979), \"Superman\" (1978) and the \"Harry Potter\" films. \nExamples.\n\"\" was released (25 March 2016), an extended cut dubbed the \"Ultimate Edition\", which features 31 minutes of additional footage, was released digitally on 28 June 2016, and on Blu-ray on 19 July 2016. \nThe film \"Caligula\" exists in at least 10 different officially released versions, ranging from a sub-90-minute television edit version of TV-14 (later TV-MA) for cable television to an unrated full pornographic version exceeding 3.5 hours. This is believed to be the most distinct versions of a single film. Among major studio films, the record is believed to be held by \"Blade Runner\"; the magazine \"Video Watchdog\" counted no less than seven distinct versions in a 1993 issue, before director Ridley Scott later released a \"Final Cut\" in 2007, bringing the supposed grand total to eight differing versions.\nWhen released on DVD and Blu-Ray in 2019, \"\" featured an Extended Cut with 7 minutes of additional footage. This is the first time since \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\", that a Harry Potter film has had one.\nThe Coen Brothers' \"Blood Simple\" was one of the few that proved not every director's cut is longer.\nMusic video director's cut.\nThe music video for the 2006 Academy Award-nominated song \"Listen\", performed by Beyonc\u00e9, received a director's cut by Diane Martel. This version of the video was later included on Knowles' \"B'Day Anthology Video Album\" (2007). Linkin Park has a director's cut version for their music video \"Faint\" (directed by Mark Romanek) in which one of the band members spray paints the words \"En Proceso\" on a wall, as well as Hoobastank also having one for 2004's \"The Reason\" which omits the woman getting hit by the car. Britney Spears' music video for 2007's \"Gimme More\" was first released as a director's cut on iTunes, with the official video released 3 days later. Many other director's cut music videos contain sexual content that can't be shown on TV thus creating alternative scenes, such as Thirty Seconds to Mars's \"Hurricane\", and in some cases, alternative videos, such as in the case of Spears' 2008 video for \"Womanizer\".\nExpanded usage in pop culture.\nAs the trend became more widely recognized, the term \"director's cut\" became increasingly used as a colloquialism to refer to an expanded version of other things, including video games, music, and comic books. This confusing usage only served to further reduce the artistic value of a \"director's cut\", and it is currently rarely used in those ways.\nVideo games.\nFor video games, these expanded versions, also referred as \"complete editions\", will have additions to the gameplay or additional game modes and features outside the main portion of the game. \nAs is the case with certain high-profile Japanese-produced games, the game designers may take the liberty to revise their product for the overseas market with additional features during the localization process. These features are later added back to the native market in a re-release of a game in what is often referred as the international version of the game. This was the case with the overseas versions of \"Final Fantasy VII\", \"Metal Gear Solid\" and \"Rogue Galaxy\", which contained additional features (such as new difficulty settings for \"Metal Gear Solid\"), resulting in re-released versions of those respective games in Japan (\"Final Fantasy VII International\", ' and \"Rogue Galaxy: Director's Cut\"). In the case of ' and ', the American versions were released first, followed by the Japanese versions and then the European versions, with each regional release offering new content not found in the previous one. All of the added content from the Japanese and European versions of those games were included in the expanded editions titled ' and \".\nThey also, similar to movies, will occasionally include extra, uncensored or alternate versions of cutscenes, as was the case with \". In markets with strict censorship, a later relaxing of those laws occasional will result in the game being rereleased with the \"Special/Uncut Edition\" tag added to differentiate between the originally released censored version and the current uncensored edition.\nSeveral of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" games have also received director's cuts and have used the term \"extension,\" though \"remake\" and \"third version\" are also often used by many fans. These include ' (Japan only), \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\" (for \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Green\"/\"Blue\"), \"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal\" (for \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\"), \"Pok\u00e9mon Emerald\" (for \"Pok\u00e9mon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\"), \"Pok\u00e9mon Platinum\" (for 'Pok\u00e9mon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\"\"), Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and Pok\u00e9mon White 2, and \"Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon\".\nMusic \"director's cuts\".\n\"Director's cuts\" in music are rarely released. A few exceptions include Guided by Voices' 1994 album \"Bee Thousand\", which was re-released as a three disc vinyl LP Director's cut in 2004, and Fall Out Boy's 2003 album \"Take This to Your Grave\", which was re-released as a Director's cut in 2005 with two extra tracks.\nIn 2011 British singer Kate Bush released the album titled \"Director's Cut\". It is made up of songs from her earlier albums \"The Sensual World\" and \"The Red Shoes\" which have been remixed and restructured, three of which were re-recorded completely."}

This is in contrast to analog video, which represents moving visual images with analog signals. Digital video comprises a series of digital images displayed in rapid succession.\nDigital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the Sony D1 format, which recorded an uncompressed standard definition component video signal in digital form. In addition to uncompressed formats, popular compressed digital video formats today include H.264 and MPEG-4. Modern interconnect standards for digital video include HDMI, DisplayPort, Digital Visual Interface (DVI) and serial digital interface (SDI).\nDigital video can be copied with no degradation in quality. In contrast, when analog sources are copied, they experience generation loss. Digital video can be stored on digital media such as Blu-ray Disc, on computer data storage or streamed over the Internet to end users who watch content on a desktop computer screen or a digital smart TV. In everyday practice, digital video content such as TV shows and movies also includes a digital audio soundtrack.\nHistory.\nDigital video cameras.\nThe basis for digital video cameras are metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) image sensors. The first practical semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), invented in 1969, based on MOS capacitor technology. Following the commercialization of CCD sensors during the late 1970s to early 1980s, the entertainment industry slowly began transitioning to digital imaging and digital video over the next two decades. The CCD was followed by the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor), developed in the 1990s.\nDigital video coding.\nThe earliest forms of digital video coding began in the 1970s, with uncompressed pulse-code modulation (PCM) video, requiring high bitrates between 45140 Mbps for standard definition (SD) content. Practical digital video coding was eventually made possible with the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a form of lossy compression. DCT compression was first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, and then developed by Ahmed with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao at the University of Texas in 1973. DCT would later become the standard for digital video compression since the late 1980s.\nThe first digital video coding standard was H.120, created by the CCITT (now ITU-T) in 1984. H.120 was not practical, due to weak performance. H.120 was based on differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM), a lossless compression algorithm that was inefficient for video coding. During the late 1980s, a number of companies began experimenting with DCT, a much more efficient form of compression for video coding. The CCITT received 14 proposals for DCT-based video compression formats, in contrast to a single proposal based on vector quantization (VQ) compression. The H.261 standard was developed based on DCT compression. H.261 was the first practical video coding standard. Since H.261, DCT compression has been adopted by all the major video coding standards that followed.\nMPEG-1, developed by the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG), followed in 1991, and it was designed to compress VHS-quality video. It was succeeded in 1994 by MPEG-2/H.262, which became the standard video format for DVD and SD digital television. It was followed by MPEG-4/H.263 in 1999, and then in 2003 it was followed by H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, which has become the most widely used video coding standard.\nDigital video production.\nStarting in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, several types of video production equipment that were digital in their internal workings were introduced. These included time base correctors (TBC) and digital video effects (DVE) units. They operated by taking a standard analog composite video input and digitizing it internally. This made it easier to either correct or enhance the video signal, as in the case of a TBC, or to manipulate and add effects to the video, in the case of a DVE unit. The digitized and processed video information was then converted back to standard analog video for output.\nLater on in the 1970s, manufacturers of professional video broadcast equipment, such as Bosch (through their Fernseh division) and Ampex developed prototype digital videotape recorders (VTR) in their research and development labs. Bosch's machine used a modified 1 inch type B videotape transport and recorded an early form of CCIR 601 digital video. Ampex's prototype digital video recorder used a modified 2-inch quadruplex videotape VTR (an Ampex AVR-3), but fitted with custom digital video electronics, and a special \"octaplex\" 8-head headwheel (regular analog 2\" quad machines only used 4 heads). Like standard 2\" quad, the audio on the Ampex prototype digital machine, nicknamed by its developers as \"Annie\", still recorded the audio in analog as linear tracks on the tape. None of these machines from these manufacturers were ever marketed commercially.\nDigital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the Sony D1 format, which recorded an uncompressed standard definition component video signal in digital form. Component video connections required 3 cables and most television facilities were wired for composite NTSC or PAL video using one cable. Due this incompatibility and also due to the cost of the recorder, D1 was used primarily by large television networks and other component-video capable video studios.\nIn 1988, Sony and Ampex co-developed and released the D2 digital videocassette format, which recorded video digitally without compression in ITU-601 format, much like D1. But D2 had the major difference of encoding the video in composite form to the NTSC standard, thereby only requiring single-cable composite video connections to and from a D2 VCR, making it a perfect fit for the majority of television facilities at the time. D2 was a successful format in the television broadcast industry throughout the late '80s and the '90s. D2 was also widely used in that era as the master tape format for mastering laserdiscs.\nD1 &amp; D2 would eventually be replaced by cheaper systems using video compression, most notably Sony's Digital Betacam that were introduced into the network's television studios. Other examples of digital video formats utilizing compression were Ampex's DCT (the first to employ such when introduced in 1992), the industry-standard DV and MiniDV and its professional variations, Sony's DVCAM and Panasonic's DVCPRO, and Betacam SX, a lower-cost variant of Digital Betacam using MPEG-2 compression.\nOne of the first digital video products to run on personal computers was \"PACo: The PICS Animation Compiler\" from The Company of Science &amp; Art in Providence, RI, which was developed starting in 1990 and first shipped in May 1991. PACo could stream unlimited-length video with synchronized sound from a single file (with the \".CAV\" file extension) on CD-ROM. Creation required a Mac; playback was possible on Macs, PCs, and Sun SPARCstations.\nQuickTime, Apple Computer's multimedia framework appeared in June 1991. Audio Video Interleave from Microsoft followed in 1992. Initial consumer-level content creation tools were crude, requiring an analog video source to be digitized to a computer-readable format. While low-quality at first, consumer digital video increased rapidly in quality, first with the introduction of playback standards such as MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 (adopted for use in television transmission and DVD media), and then the introduction of the DV tape format allowing recordings in the format to be transferred direct to digital video files using a FireWire port on an editing computer. This simplified the process, allowing non-linear editing systems (NLE) to be deployed cheaply and widely on desktop computers with no external playback or recording equipment needed.\nThe widespread adoption of digital video and accompanying compression formats has reduced the bandwidth needed for a high-definition video signal (with HDV and AVCHD, as well as several commercial variants such as DVCPRO-HD, all using less bandwidth than a standard definition analog signal). These savings have increased the number of channels available on cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems, created opportunities for spectrum reallocation of terrestrial television broadcast frequencies, made tapeless camcorders based on flash memory possible among other innovations and efficiencies.\nOverview.\nDigital video comprises a series of digital images displayed in rapid succession. In the context of video these images are called frames. The rate at which frames are displayed is known as the frame rate and is measured in frames per second (FPS). Every frame is an orthogonal bitmap digital image and so comprises a raster of pixels. Pixels have only one property, their color. The color of a pixel is represented by a fixed number of bits. The more bits the more subtle variations of colors can be reproduced. This is called the color depth of the video.\nInterlacing.\nIn interlaced video each \"frame\" is composed of two halves of an image. The first half contains only the odd-numbered lines of a full frame. The second half contains only the even-numbered lines. Those halves are referred to individually as \"fields\". Two consecutive fields compose a full frame. If an interlaced video has a frame rate of 30 frames per second the field rate is 60 fields per second. All the properties discussed here apply equally to interlaced video but one should be careful not to confuse the fields-per-second rate with the frames-per-second rate.\nBit rate and BPP.\nBy its definition, bit rate is a measure of the rate of information content of the digital video stream. In the case of uncompressed video, bit rate corresponds directly to the quality of the video as bit rate is proportional to every property that affects the video quality. Bit rate is an important property when transmitting video because the transmission link must be capable of supporting that bit rate. Bit rate is also important when dealing with the storage of video because, as shown above, the video size is proportional to the bit rate and the duration. Video compression is used to greatly reduce the bit rate while having a lesser effect on quality. \nBits per pixel (BPP) is a measure of the efficiency of compression. A true-color video with no compression at all may have a BPP of 24 bits/pixel. Chroma subsampling can reduce the BPP to 16 or 12 bits/pixel. Applying jpeg compression on every frame can reduce the BPP to 8 or even 1 bits/pixel. Applying video compression algorithms like MPEG1, MPEG2 or MPEG4 allows for fractional BPP values.\nConstant bit rate versus variable bit rate.\nBPP represents the \"average\" bits per pixel. There are compression algorithms that keep the BPP almost constant throughout the entire duration of the video. In this case, we also get video output with a constant bitrate (CBR). This CBR video is suitable for real-time, non-buffered, fixed bandwidth video streaming (e.g. in videoconferencing). As not all frames can be compressed at the same level, because quality is more severely impacted for scenes of high complexity, some algorithms try to constantly adjust the BPP. They keep it high while compressing complex scenes and low for less demanding scenes. This way, one gets the best quality at the smallest average bit rate (and the smallest file size, accordingly). This method produces a variable bitrate because it tracks the variations of the BPP.\nTechnical overview.\nStandard film stocks typically record at 24 frames per second. For video, there are two frame rate standards: NTSC, at 30/1.001 (about 29.97) frames per second (about 59.94 fields per second), and PAL, 25 frames per second (50 fields per second). Digital video cameras come in two different image capture formats: interlaced and progressive scan. Interlaced cameras record the image in alternating sets of lines: the odd-numbered lines are scanned, and then the even-numbered lines are scanned, then the odd-numbered lines are scanned again, and so on. One set of odd or even lines is referred to as a \"field\", and a consecutive pairing of two fields of opposite parity is called a \"frame\". Progressive scan cameras record all lines in each frame as a single unit. Thus, interlaced video captures samples the scene motion twice as often as progressive video does, for the same frame rate. Progressive-scan generally produces a slightly sharper image. However, motion may not be as smooth as interlaced video.\nDigital video can be copied with no generation loss which degrades quality in analog systems. However a change in parameters like frame size or a change of the digital format can decrease the quality of the video due to image scaling and transcoding losses. Digital video can be manipulated and edited on a non-linear editing systems frequently implemented using commodity computer hardware and software.\nDigital video has a significantly lower cost than 35\u00a0mm film. In comparison to the high cost of film stock, the digital media used for digital video recording, such as flash memory or hard disk drive, used for recording digital video is very inexpensive. Digital video also allows footage to be viewed on location without the expensive and time-consuming chemical processing required by film. Network transfer of digital video makes physical deliveries of tapes and film reels unnecessary. \nDigital television (including higher quality HDTV) was introduced in most developed countries in early 2000s. Digital video is used in modern mobile phones and video conferencing systems. Digital video is used for Internet distribution of media, including streaming video and peer-to-peer movie distribution. \nMany types of video compression exist for serving digital video over the internet and on optical disks. The file sizes of digital video used for professional editing are generally not practical for these purposes, and the video requires further compression with codecs.\n, the highest resolution demonstrated for digital video generation is 35 megapixels (8192 x 4320). The highest speed is attained in industrial and scientific high speed cameras that are capable of filming 1024x1024 video at up to 1 million frames per second for brief periods of recording.\nProperties.\nLive digital video consumes bandwidth. Recorded digital video consumes data storage. The amount of bandwidth or storage required is determined by the frame size, color depth and frame rate. Each pixel consumes a number of bits determined by the color depth. The data required to represent a frame of data is determined by multiplying by the number of pixels in the image. The bandwidth is determined by multiplying the storage requirement for a frame by the frame rate. The overall storage requirements for a program can then be determined by multiplying bandwidth by the duration of the program.\nThese calculations are accurate for uncompressed video but because of the relatively high bit rate of uncompressed video, video compression is extensively used. In the case of compressed video, each frame requires a small percentage of the original bits. Note that it is not necessary that all frames are equally compressed by the same percentage. In practice, they are not so it is useful to consider the \"average\" factor of compression for \"all\" the frames taken together.\nInterfaces and cables.\nPurpose-built digital video interfaces\nGeneral-purpose interfaces use to carry digital video\nThe following interface has been designed for carrying MPEG-Transport compressed video:\nCompressed video is also carried using UDP-IP over Ethernet. Two approaches exist for this:\nOther methods of carrying video over IP"}

It performs both of the main DNS server roles, acting as an authoritative name server for domains, and acting as a recursive resolver in the network. As of 2015, it is the most widely used domain name server software, and is the \"de facto\" standard on Unix-like operating systems.\nThe software was originally designed at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) in the early 1980s. The name originates as an acronym of \"Berkeley Internet Name Domain\", reflecting the application's use within UCB. The software consists, most prominently, of the DNS server component, called \"named\", a contracted form of \"name daemon\". In addition, the suite contains various administration tools, and a DNS resolver interface library. The latest version of BIND is BIND 9, first released in 2000. BIND 9 is actively maintained, with new releases issued several times a year.\nStarting in 2009, the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) developed a software suite, initially called BIND10. With release version 1.2.0 the project was renamed \"Bundy\" to terminate ISC involvement in the project.\nKey features.\nBIND 9 is intended to be fully compliant with the IETF DNS standards and draft standards. Important features of BIND 9 include: TSIG, nsupdate, IPv6, RNDC (remote name daemon control), views, multiprocessor support, Response Rate Limiting (RRL), DNSSEC, and broad portability. RNDC enables remote configuration updates, using a shared secret to provide encryption for local and remote terminals during each session.\nDatabase support.\nWhile earlier versions of BIND offered no mechanism to store and retrieve zone data in anything other than flat text files, in 2007 BIND 9.4 DLZ provided a compile-time option for zone storage in a variety of database formats including LDAP, Berkeley DB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and ODBC.\nBIND 10 planned to make the data store modular, so that a variety of databases may be connected.\nIn 2016 ISC added support for the 'dyndb' interface, contributed by RedHat, with BIND version 9.11.0.\nSecurity.\nSecurity issues that are discovered in BIND 9 are patched and publicly disclosed in keeping with common principles of open source software. A complete list of security defects that have been discovered and disclosed in BIND9 is maintained by Internet Systems Consortium, the current authors of the software.\nThe BIND 4 and BIND 8 releases both had serious security vulnerabilities. Use of these ancient versions, or any un-maintained, non-supported version is strongly discouraged. BIND 9 was a complete rewrite, in part to mitigate these ongoing security issues. The downloads page on the ISC web site clearly shows which versions are currently maintained and which are end of life.\nHistory.\nOriginally written by four graduate students at the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), BIND was first released with Berkeley Software Distribution 4.3BSD. Paul Vixie started maintaining it in 1988 while working for Digital Equipment Corporation. , the Internet Systems Consortium maintains, updates, and writes new versions of BIND.\nBIND was written by Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle and Songnian Zhou in the early 1980s at the University of California, Berkeley as a result of a DARPA grant. The acronym \"BIND\" is for \"Berkeley Internet Name Domain\", from a technical paper published in 1984.\nVersions of BIND through 4.8.3 were maintained by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at UC Berkeley.\nIn the mid-1980s, Paul Vixie of DEC took over BIND development, releasing versions 4.9 and 4.9.1. Vixie continued to work on BIND after leaving DEC. BIND Version 4.9.2 was sponsored by Vixie Enterprises. Vixie eventually founded the ISC, which became the entity responsible for BIND versions starting with 4.9.3.\nBIND 8 was released by ISC in May 1997.\nVersion 9 was developed by Nominum, Inc. under an ISC outsourcing contract, and the first version was released 9 October 2000. It was written from scratch in part to address the architectural difficulties with auditing the earlier BIND code bases, and also to support DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions). The development of BIND 9 took place under a combination of commercial and military contracts. Most of the features of BIND 9 were funded by UNIX vendors who wanted to ensure that BIND stayed competitive with Microsoft's DNS offerings; the DNSSEC features were funded by the US military, which regarded DNS security as important. BIND 9 was released in September 2000.\nIn 2009, ISC started an effort to develop a new version of the software suite, called BIND10. In addition to DNS service, the BIND10 suite also included IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP server components. In April 2014, with the BIND10 release 1.2.0 the ISC concluded its development work of the project and renamed the project to \"Bundy\", moving the source code repository to GitHub for further development by outside public efforts. ISC discontinued its involvement in the project due to cost-cutting measures. The development of DHCP components was split off to become a new Kea project."}

Bernstein in response to his frustrations with repeated security holes in the widely used BIND DNS software. As a challenge, Bernstein offered a $1000 prize for the first person to find a security hole in djbdns, which was awarded in March 2009 to Matthew Dempsky.\n, djbdns's tinydns component was the second most popular DNS server in terms of the number of domains for which it was the authoritative server, and third most popular in terms of the number of DNS hosts running it.\ndjbdns has never been vulnerable to the widespread cache poisoning vulnerability reported in July 2008, but it has been discovered that it is vulnerable to a related attack.\nThe source code has not been centrally managed since its release in 2001, and was released into the public domain in 2007. As of March 2009, there are a number of forks, one of which is dbndns (part of the Debian Project), and more than a dozen patches to modify the released version.\nWhile djbdns does not directly support DNSSEC, there are third party patches to add DNSSEC support to djbdns' authoritative-only tinydns component.\nComponents.\nThe djbdns software consists of servers, clients, and miscellaneous configuration tools.\nDesign.\nIn djbdns, different features and services are split off into separate programs. For example, zone transfers, zone file parsing, caching, and recursive resolving are implemented as separate programs. The result of these design decisions is a reduction in code size and complexity of the daemon program that provides the core function of answering lookup requests. Bernstein asserts that this is true to the spirit of the Unix operating system, and makes security verification much simpler.\nCopyright status.\nOn December 28, 2007, Bernstein released djbdns into the public domain. Previously the package was distributed free of charge as license-free software. However this did not permit the distribution of modified versions of djbdns, which was one of the core principles of open-source software. Consequently, it was not included in Linux distributions which required all components to be open-source."}
{"id": "8741", "revid": "3150196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8741", "title": "Dylan (programming language)", "text": "Dylan is a multi-paradigm programming language that includes support for functional and object-oriented programming (OOP), and is dynamic and reflective while providing a programming model designed to support generating efficient machine code, including fine-grained control over dynamic and static behaviors. It was created in the early 1990s by a group led by Apple Computer.\nA concise and thorough overview of the language may be found in the Dylan Reference Manual.\nDylan derives from Scheme and Common Lisp and adds an integrated object system derived from the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). In Dylan, all values (including numbers, characters, functions, and classes) are first-class objects. Dylan supports multiple inheritance, polymorphism, multiple dispatch, keyword arguments, object introspection, pattern-based syntax extension macros, and many other advanced features. Programs can express fine-grained control over dynamism, admitting programs that occupy a continuum between dynamic and static programming and supporting evolutionary development (allowing for rapid prototyping followed by incremental refinement and optimization).\nDylan's main design goal is to be a dynamic language well-suited for developing commercial software. Dylan attempts to address potential performance issues by introducing \"natural\" limits to the full flexibility of Lisp systems, allowing the compiler to clearly understand compilable units, such as libraries.\nDylan derives much of its semantics from Scheme and other Lisps; some Dylan implementations were initially built within extant Lisp systems. However, Dylan has an ALGOL-like syntax instead of a Lisp-like prefix syntax.\nHistory.\nDylan was created in the early 1990s by a group led by Apple Computer. At one time in its development, it was intended for use with the Apple Newton computer, but the Dylan implementation did not reach sufficient maturity in time, and Newton instead used a mix of C and the NewtonScript developed by Walter Smith. Apple ended their Dylan development effort in 1995, though they made a \"technology release\" version available (Apple Dylan TR1) that included an advanced integrated development environment (IDE).\nTwo other groups contributed to the design of the language and developed implementations: Harlequin released a commercial IDE for Microsoft Windows and Carnegie Mellon University released an open source compiler for Unix systems called Gwydion Dylan. Both of these implementations are now open source. The Harlequin implementation is now named Open Dylan and is maintained by a group of volunteers, the Dylan Hackers.\nThe Dylan language was code-named Ralph. James Joaquin chose the name Dylan for \"DYnamic LANguage.\"\nSyntax.\nMany of Dylan's syntax features come from its Lisp heritage. Originally, Dylan used a Lisp-like prefix syntax, which was based on s-expressions. By the time the language design was completed, the syntax was changed to an ALGOL-like syntax, with the expectation that it would be more familiar to a wider audience of programmers. The syntax was designed by Michael Kahl. It is described in great detail in the Dylan Reference Manual.\nLexical syntax.\nDylan is not case sensitive. Dylan's lexical syntax allows the use of a naming convention where hyphen-minus signs are used to connect the parts of multiple-word identifiers (sometimes called \"lisp-case\" or \"kebab case\"). This convention is common in Lisp languages but cannot be used in programming languages that treat any hyphen-minus that is not part of a numeric literal as a single lexical token, even when not surrounded by whitespace characters.\nBesides alphanumeric characters and hyphen-minus signs, Dylan allows certain non-alphanumerical characters as part of identifiers. Identifiers may not consist of these non-alphanumeric characters or of numeric characters alone. If there is any ambiguity, whitespace is used.\nExample code.\nA simple class with several slots:\ndefine class &lt;point&gt; (&lt;object&gt;)\n slot point-x :: &lt;integer&gt;,\n required-init-keyword: x:;\n slot point-y :: &lt;integer&gt;,\n required-init-keyword: y:;\nend class &lt;point&gt;;\nBy convention, classes are named with less-than and greater-than signs used as angle brackets, e.g. the class named codice_1 in the code example.\nIn codice_2 both codice_3 and codice_1 are optional. This is true for all codice_5 clauses. For example, you may write codice_6 or just codice_5 to terminate an codice_8 statement.\nThe same class, rewritten in the most minimal way possible:\ndefine class &lt;point&gt; (&lt;object&gt;)\n slot point-x;\n slot point-y;\nend;\nThe slots are now both typed as codice_9. The slots must be initialized manually.\nBy convention, constant names begin with \"$\":\ndefine constant $pi :: &lt;double-float&gt; = 3.1415927d0;\nA factorial function:\ndefine function factorial (n :: &lt;integer&gt;) =&gt; (n! :: &lt;integer&gt;)\n case\n n &lt; 0 =&gt; error(\"Can't take factorial of negative integer: %d\\n\", n);\n n = 0 =&gt; 1;\n otherwise =&gt; n * factorial(n - 1);\n end\nend;\nHere, codice_10 and codice_11 are just normal identifiers.\nThere is no explicit return statement. The result of a method or function is the last expression evaluated. It is a common style to leave off the semicolon after an expression in return position.\nModules vs. namespace.\nIn many object-oriented languages, classes are the main means of encapsulation and modularity; each class defines a namespace and controls which definitions are externally visible. Further, classes in many languages define an indivisible unit that must be used as a whole. For example, using a codice_12 concatenation function requires importing and compiling against all of codice_12.\nSome languages, including Dylan, also include a separate, explicit namespace or module system that performs encapsulation in a more general way.\nIn Dylan, the concepts of compile-unit and import-unit are separated, and classes have nothing specifically to do with either. A \"library\" defines items that should be compiled and handled together, while a \"module\" defines a namespace. Classes can be placed together in modules, or cut across them, as the programmer wishes. Often the complete definition for a class does not exist in a single module, but is spread across several that are optionally collected together. Different programs can have different definitions of the same class, including only what they need.\nFor example, consider an add-on library for regex support on codice_12. In some languages, for the functionality to be included in strings, the functionality must be added to the codice_12 namespace. As soon as this occurs, the codice_12 class becomes larger, and functions that don't need to use regex still must \"pay\" for it in increased library size. For this reason, these sorts of add-ons are typically placed in their own namespaces and objects. The downside to this approach is that the new functions are no longer a \"part of\" codice_12; instead, it is isolated in its own set of functions that must be called separately. Instead of codice_18, which would be the natural organization from an OO viewpoint, something like codice_19 is used, which effectively reverses the ordering.\nUnder Dylan, many interfaces can be defined for the same code, for instance the String concatenation method could be placed in both the String interface, and the \"concat\" interface which collects together all of the different concatenation functions from various classes. This is more commonly used in math libraries, where functions tend to be applicable to widely differing object types.\nA more practical use of the interface construct is to build public and private versions of a module, something that other languages include as a \"bolt on\" feature that invariably causes problems and adds syntax. Under Dylan, every function call can be simply places in the \"Private\" or \"Development\" interface, and collect up publicly accessible functions in codice_20. Under Java or C++ the visibility of an object is defined in the code, meaning that to support a similar change, a programmer would be forced to rewrite the definitions fully, and could not have two versions at the same time.\nClasses.\nClasses in Dylan describe codice_21 (data members, fields, ivars, etc.) of objects in a fashion similar to most OO languages. All access to slots are via methods, as in Smalltalk. Default getter and setter methods are automatically generated based on the slot names. In contrast with most other OO languages, other methods applicable to the class are often defined outside of the class, and thus class definitions in Dylan typically include the definition of the storage only. For instance:\ndefine class &lt;window&gt; (&lt;view&gt;)\n slot title :: &lt;string&gt; = \"untitled\", init-keyword: title:;\n slot position :: &lt;point&gt;, required-init-keyword: position:;\nend class;\nIn this example, the class \"codice_22\" is defined. The &lt;class name&gt; syntax is convention only, to make the class names stand out\u2014the angle brackets are merely part of the class name. In contrast, in some languages the convention is to capitalize the first letter of the class name or to prefix the name with a \"C\" or \"T\" (for example). codice_22 inherits from a single class, codice_24, and contains two slots, codice_25 holding a string for the window title, and codice_26 holding an X-Y point for a corner of the window. In this example, the title has been given a default value, while the position has not. The optional \"init-keyword\" syntax allows the programmer to specify the initial value of the slot when instantiating an object of the class.\nIn languages such as C++ or Java, the class would also define its interface. In this case the definition above has no explicit instructions, so in both languages access to the slots and methods is considered codice_27, meaning they can be used only by subclasses. To allow unrelated code to use the window instances, they must be declared codice_28.\nIn Dylan, these sorts of visibility rules are not considered part of the code, but of the module/interface system. This adds considerable flexibility. For instance, one interface used during early development could declare everything public, whereas one used in testing and deployment could limit this. With C++ or Java these changes would require changes to the source code, so people won't do it, whereas in Dylan this is a fully unrelated concept.\nAlthough this example does not use it, Dylan also supports multiple inheritance.\nMethods and generic functions.\nIn Dylan, methods are not intrinsically associated with any specific class; methods can be thought of as existing outside of classes. Like CLOS, Dylan is based on multiple dispatch (multimethods), where the specific method to be called is chosen based on the types of all its arguments. The method need not be known at compile time, the understanding being that the required function may be available, or not, based on a user's preferences.\nUnder Java the same methods would be isolated in a specific class. To use that functionality the programmer is forced to \"import\" that class and refer to it explicitly to call the method. If that class is unavailable, or unknown at compile time, the application simply won't compile.\nIn Dylan, code is isolated from storage in \"functions\". Many classes have methods that call their own functions, thereby looking and feeling like most other OO languages. However code may also be located in \"generic functions\", meaning they are not attached to a specific class, and can be called natively by anyone. Linking a specific generic function to a method in a class is accomplished thusly:\ndefine method turn-blue (w :: &lt;window&gt;)\n w.color := $blue;\nend method;\nThis definition is similar to those in other languages, and would likely be encapsulated within the codice_22 class. Note the := setter call, which is syntactic sugar for codice_30.\nThe utility of generic methods comes into its own when you consider more \"generic\" examples. For instance, one common function in most languages is the codice_31, which returns some human-readable form for the object. For instance, a window might return its title and its position in parens, while a string would return itself. In Dylan these methods could all be collected into a single module called \"codice_31\", thereby removing this code from the definition of the class itself. If a specific object did not support a codice_31, it could be easily added in the codice_31 module.\nExtensibility.\nThis whole concept might strike some readers as very odd. The code to handle codice_31 for a window isn't defined in codice_22? This might not make any sense until you consider how Dylan handles the call of the codice_31. In most languages when the program is compiled the codice_31 for codice_22 is looked up and replaced with a pointer (more or less) to the method. In Dylan this occurs when the program is first run; the runtime builds a table of method-name/parameters details and looks up methods dynamically via this table. That means that a function for a specific method can be located anywhere, not just in the compile-time unit. In the end the programmer is given considerable flexibility in terms of where to place their code, collecting it along class lines where appropriate, and functional lines where it's not.\nThe implication here is that a programmer can add functionality to existing classes by defining functions in a separate file. For instance, you might wish to add spell checking to all codice_40s, which in most languages would require access to the source code of the string class\u2014and such basic classes are rarely given out in source form. In Dylan (and other \"extensible languages\") the spell checking method could be added in the codice_41 module, defining all of the classes on which it can be applied via the codice_42 construct. In this case the actual functionality might be defined in a single generic function, which takes a string and returns the errors. When the codice_41 module is compiled into your program, all strings (and other objects) will get the added functionality.\nApple Dylan.\nApple Dylan is the implementation of Dylan produced by Apple Computer. It was originally developed for the Apple Newton product."}

This fifteen-element Dublin Core has been formally standardized as ISO 15836, ANSI/NISO Z39.85, and IETF RFC 5013. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), which formulates the Dublin\nCore, is a project of the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T), a non-profit organization. The core properties are part of a larger set of DCMI Metadata Terms. \"Dublin Core\" is also used as an adjective for Dublin Core metadata, a style of metadata that draws on multiple Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies, packaged and constrained in Dublin Core application profiles.\nThe resources described using the Dublin Core may be digital resources (video, images, web pages, etc.) as well as physical resources such as books or works of art.Dublin Core metadata may be used for multiple purposes, from simple resource description to combining metadata vocabularies of different metadata standards, to providing interoperability for metadata vocabularies in the linked data cloud and Semantic Web implementations.\nBackground.\n\"Dublin\" refers to Dublin, Ohio, USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop, hosted by the OCLC (known at that time as Online Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). \"Core\" refers to the metadata terms as \"broad and generic being usable for describing a wide range of resources\". The semantics of Dublin Core were established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from librarianship, computer science, text encoding, museums, and other related fields of scholarship and practice.\nStarting in 2000, the Dublin Core community focused on \"application profiles\" \u2013 the idea that metadata records would use Dublin Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements. During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium's work on a generic data model for metadata, the Resource Description Framework (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF, more recently in the context of the linked data movement.\nThe Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) provides an open forum for the development of interoperable online metadata standards for a broad range of purposes and of business models. DCMI's activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops, standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an independent entity.\nCurrently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.\nLevels of the standard.\nThe Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. \"Simple Dublin Core\" comprised 15 elements; \"Qualified Dublin Core\" included three additional elements (Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers) that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.\nSince 2012, the two have been incorporated into the \"DCMI Metadata Terms\" as a single set of terms using the RDF data model. The full set of elements is found under the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms/. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges, which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/.\nDublin Core Metadata Element Set.\nThe original DCMES Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements, defined this way in the original specification:\nEach Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a NISO standards, Z39.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007, ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the ISO/IEC 19788-2 Metadata for learning resources (MLR) \u2013 Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36.\nFull information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in the Dublin Core Metadata Registry.\nExample of use [and mention] by WebCite.\nOn the \"archive form\" web page for WebCite it says, in part: \"Metadata (optional): These are Dublin Core elements. [...]\".\nQualified Dublin Core.\n(Superseded in 2008 by the DCMI Metadata Terms.) Subsequent to the specification of the original 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the DCMES was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.\nElement refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the \"Dumb-Down Principle\", states that an application that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery.\nIn addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation, for example, \"2000-12-31\" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may still be useful to a \"human reader\".\nAudience, Provenance and RightsHolder are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15 elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core. DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type. This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.\nDCMI Metadata Terms.\nThe DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary. This set includes the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in \"italic\"), as well as the qualified terms. Each term has a unique URI in the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms, and all are defined as RDF properties.\nSyntax.\nSyntax choices for metadata expressed with the Dublin Core elements depend on context. Dublin Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent and apply to a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation by both machines and people.\nThe Dublin Core Abstract Model provides a reference model against which particular Dublin Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such a reference model helps implementers get a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between different syntaxes.\nNotable applications.\nOne Document Type Definition based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework (OMF) specification. OMF is in turn used by Rarian (superseding ScrollKeeper), which is used by the GNOME desktop and KDE help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server.\nPBCore is also based on Dublin Core. The Zope CMF's Metadata products, used by the Plone, ERP5, the Nuxeo CPS Content management systems, SimpleDL, and Fedora Commons also implement Dublin Core. The EPUB e-book format uses Dublin Core metadata in the OPF file.\nThe Australian Government Locator Service (AGLS) metadata standard is an application profile of Dublin Core."}
{"id": "8743", "revid": "35379823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8743", "title": "Document Object Model", "text": " \nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.\nThe principal standardization of the DOM was handled by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which last developed a recommendation in 2004. WHATWG took over the development of the standard, publishing it as a living document. The W3C now publishes stable snapshots of the WHATWG standard.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Document Object Model is intertwined with the history of the \"browser wars\" of the late 1990s between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, as well as with that of JavaScript and JScript, the first scripting languages to be widely implemented in the JavaScript engines of web browsers.\nJavaScript was released by Netscape Communications in 1995 within Netscape Navigator 2.0. Netscape's competitor, Microsoft, released Internet Explorer 3.0 the following year with a reimplementation of JavaScript called JScript. JavaScript and JScript let web developers create web pages with client-side interactivity. The limited facilities for detecting user-generated events and modifying the HTML document in the first generation of these languages eventually became known as \"DOM Level 0\" or \"Legacy DOM.\" No independent standard was developed for DOM Level 0, but it was partly described in the specifications for HTML 4.\nLegacy DOM was limited in the kinds of elements that could be accessed. Form, link and image elements could be referenced with a hierarchical name that began with the root document object. A hierarchical name could make use of either the names or the sequential index of the traversed elements. For example, a form input element could be accessed as either codice_1 or codice_2.\nThe Legacy DOM enabled client-side form validation and simple interface interactivity like creating tooltips.\nIn 1997, Netscape and Microsoft released version 4.0 of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer respectively, adding support for Dynamic HTML (DHTML) functionality enabling changes to a loaded HTML document. DHTML required extensions to the rudimentary document object that was available in the Legacy DOM implementations. Although the Legacy DOM implementations were largely compatible since JScript was based on JavaScript, the DHTML DOM extensions were developed in parallel by each browser maker and remained incompatible. These versions of the DOM became known as the \"Intermediate DOM.\"\nAfter the standardization of ECMAScript, the W3C DOM Working Group began drafting a standard DOM specification. The completed specification, known as \"DOM Level 1\", became a W3C Recommendation in late 1998. By 2005, large parts of W3C DOM were well-supported by common ECMAScript-enabled browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6 (from 2001), Opera, Safari and Gecko-based browsers (like Mozilla, Firefox, SeaMonkey and Camino).\nStandards.\nThe W3C DOM Working Group published its final recommendation and subsequently disbanded in 2004. Development efforts migrated to the WHATWG, which continues to maintain a living standard. In 2009, the Web Applications group reorganized DOM activities at the W3C. In 2013, due to a lack of progress and the impending release of HTML5, the DOM Level 4 specification was reassigned to the HTML Working Group to expedite its completion. Meanwhile, in 2015, the Web Applications group was disbanded and DOM stewardship passed to the Web Platform group. Beginning with the publication of DOM Level 4 in 2015, the W3C creates new recommendations based on snapshots of the WHATWG standard.\nApplications.\nWeb browsers.\nTo render a document such as a HTML page, most web browsers use an internal model similar to the DOM. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the \"DOM tree\", with the topmost node named as \"Document object\". When an HTML page is rendered in browsers, the browser downloads the HTML into local memory and automatically parses it to display the page on screen.\nJavaScript.\nWhen a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page, which is an object oriented representation of an HTML document that acts as an interface between JavaScript and the document itself. This allows the creation of dynamic web pages, because within a page JavaScript can:\nImplementations.\nBecause the DOM supports navigation in any direction (e.g., parent and previous sibling) and allows for arbitrary modifications, an implementation must at least buffer the document that has been read so far (or some parsed form of it).\nLayout engines.\nWeb browsers rely on layout engines to parse HTML into a DOM. Some layout engines, such as Trident/MSHTML, are associated primarily or exclusively with a particular browser, such as Internet Explorer.

The idea was introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander and has been adapted for various other disciplines, notably software engineering.\nDetails.\nAn organized collection of design patterns that relate to a particular field is called a pattern language. This language gives a common terminology for discussing the situations designers are faced with.\nDocumenting a pattern requires explaining why a particular situation causes problems, and how the components of the pattern relate to each other to give the solution. Christopher Alexander describes common design problems as arising from \"conflicting forces\"\u2014such as the conflict between wanting a room to be sunny and wanting it not to overheat on summer afternoons. A pattern would not tell the designer how many windows to put in the room; instead, it would propose a set of values to guide the designer toward a decision that is best for their particular application. Alexander, for example, suggests that enough windows should be included to direct light all around the room. He considers this a good solution because he believes it increases the enjoyment of the room by its occupants. Other authors might come to different conclusions, if they place higher value on heating costs, or material costs. These values, used by the pattern's author to determine which solution is \"best\", must also be documented within the pattern.\nPattern documentation should also explain when it is applicable. Since two houses may be very different from one another, a design pattern for houses must be broad enough to apply to both of them, but not so vague that it doesn't help the designer make decisions. The range of situations in which a pattern can be used is called its context. Some examples might be \"all houses\", \"all two-story houses\", or \"all places where people spend time\".\nFor instance, in Christopher Alexander's work, bus stops and waiting rooms in a surgery center are both within the context for the pattern \"A PLACE TO WAIT\".\nExamples.\nBusiness models also have design patterns.

It is used as a recreational psychedelic drug and prepared by various cultures for ritual purposes as an entheogen.\nDMT has a rapid onset, intense effects, and a relatively short duration of action. For those reasons, DMT was known as the \"business trip\" during the 1960s in the United States, as a user could access the full depth of a psychedelic experience in considerably less time than with other substances such as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms. DMT can be inhaled, ingested, or injected and its effects depend on the dose, as well as its mode of administration. When inhaled or injected, the effects last a short period of time: about five to 15 minutes. Effects can last three hours or more when orally ingested along with an MAOI, such as the ayahuasca brew of many native Amazonian tribes. DMT can produce vivid \"projections\" of mystical experiences involving euphoria and dynamic hallucinations of geometric forms.\nDMT is a functional analog and structural analog of other psychedelic tryptamines such as \"O\"-acetylpsilocin (4-AcO-DMT), 5-MeO-DMT, psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), psilocin (4-HO-DMT), and bufotenin (5-HO-DMT). The structure of DMT occurs within some important biomolecules like serotonin and melatonin, making them structural analogs of DMT.\nUsage.\nDMT is produced in many species of plants often in conjunction with its close chemical relatives 5-methoxy-\"N\",\"N\"-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and bufotenin (5-OH-DMT). DMT-containing plants are commonly used in indigenous Amazonian shamanic practices. It is usually one of the main active constituents of the drink ayahuasca; however, ayahuasca is sometimes brewed with plants that do not produce DMT. It occurs as the primary psychoactive alkaloid in several plants including \"Mimosa tenuiflora\", \"Diplopterys cabrerana\", and \"Psychotria viridis\". DMT is found as a minor alkaloid in snuff made from Virola bark resin in which 5-MeO-DMT is the main active alkaloid. DMT is also found as a minor alkaloid in bark, pods, and beans of \"Anadenanthera peregrina\" and \"Anadenanthera colubrina\" used to make Yopo and Vilca snuff, in which bufotenin is the main active alkaloid. Psilocin and its precursor psilocybin, an active chemical in many psilocybin mushrooms, are structurally similar to DMT.\nThe psychotropic effects of DMT were first studied scientifically by the Hungarian chemist and psychologist Stephen Sz\u00e1ra, who performed research with volunteers in the mid-1950s. Sz\u00e1ra, who later worked for the United States National Institutes of Health, had turned his attention to DMT after his order for LSD from the Swiss company Sandoz Laboratories was rejected on the grounds that the powerful psychotropic could be dangerous in the hands of a communist country.\nDMT is generally not active orally unless it is combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), for example, harmaline. Without a MAOI, the body quickly metabolizes orally administered DMT, and it therefore has no hallucinogenic effect unless the dose exceeds monoamine oxidase's metabolic capacity. Other means of ingestion such as vaporizing, injecting, or insufflating the drug can produce powerful hallucinations for a short time (usually less than half an hour), as the DMT reaches the brain before it can be metabolized by the body's natural monoamine oxidase. Taking a MAOI prior to vaporizing or injecting DMT prolongs and potentiates the effects.\nEffects.\nSubjective psychedelic experiences.\nInduced DMT experiences can include profound time-dilation, visual, auditory, tactile, and proprioceptive distortions and hallucinations, and other experiences that, by most firsthand accounts, defy verbal or visual description. Examples include perceiving hyperbolic geometry or seeing Escher-like impossible objects.\nSeveral scientific experimental studies have tried to measure subjective experiences of altered states of consciousness induced by drugs under highly controlled and safe conditions.\nRick Strassman and his colleagues conducted a five-year-long DMT study at the University of New Mexico in the 1990s. The results provided insight about the quality of subjective psychedelic experiences. In this study participants received the DMT dosage intravenously via injection and the findings suggested that different psychedelic experiences can occur, depending on the level of dosage. Lower doses (0.01 and 0.05\u00a0mg/kg) produced somaesthetic and emotional responses, but not hallucinogenic experiences (e.g., 0.05\u00a0mg/kg had mild mood elevating and calming properties). In contrast, responses produced by higher doses (0.2 and 0.4\u00a0mg/kg) researchers labeled as \"hallucinogenic\" that elicited \"intensely colored, rapidly moving display of visual images, formed, abstract or both\". Comparing to other sensory modalities the most affected was the visual. Participants reported visual hallucinations, fewer auditory hallucinations and specific physical sensations progressing to a sense of bodily dissociation, as well as to experiences of euphoria, calm, fear, and anxiety.\nStrassman also stressed the importance of the context where the drug has been taken. He claimed that DMT has no beneficial effects of itself, rather the context when and where people take it plays an important role.\nIt appears that DMT can induce a state or feeling where the person believes to \"communicate with other intelligent-life forms\" (see \"Machine Elves\"). High doses of DMT produce a state that involves a sense of \"another intelligence\" that people sometimes describe as \"super-intelligent\", but \"emotionally detached\".\nA 1995 study by Adolf Dittrich and Daniel Lamparter found that DMT-induced altered state of consciousness (ASC) is strongly influenced by habitual rather than situative factors. In the study, researchers used three dimensions of the APZ questionnaire to examine ASC. The first dimension, oceanic boundlessness (OB), refers to dissolution of ego boundaries and is mostly associated with positive emotions. The second dimension, anxious ego-dissolution (AED), represents a disordering of thoughts and decreases in autonomy and self-control. Lastly, visionary restructuralization (VR) refers to auditory/ visual illusions and hallucinations. Results showed strong effects within the first and third dimensions for all conditions, especially with DMT, and suggested strong intrastability of elicited reactions independently of the condition for the OB and VR scales. \nReported encounters with external entities.\nEntities perceived during DMT inebriation have been represented in diverse forms of psychedelic art. The term \"machine elf\" was coined by ethnobotanist Terence McKenna for the entities he encountered in DMT \"hyperspace\", also using terms like \"fractal elves\", or \"self-transforming machine elves\". McKenna first encountered the \"machine elves\" after smoking DMT in Berkeley in 1965. His subsequent speculations regarding the hyperdimensional space in which they were encountered have inspired a great many artists and musicians, and the meaning of DMT entities has been a subject of considerable debate among participants in a networked cultural underground, enthused by McKenna's effusive accounts of DMT hyperspace. Cliff Pickover has also written about the \"machine elf\" experience, in the book \"Sex, Drugs, Einstein, &amp; Elves\", while Rick Strassman notes many similarities between self-reports of his DMT study participants' encounters with these \"entities\", and mythological descriptions of figures such as Chayot Ha Kodesh in Ancient religions, including both angels and demons. Strassman also argues for a similarity in his study participants' descriptions of mechanized wheels, gears and machinery in these encounters, with those described in visions of encounters with the Living Creatures and Ophanim of the Hebrew Bible, noting they may stem from a common neuropsychopharmacological experience.\nStrassman argues that the more positive of the \"external entities\" encountered in DMT experiences should be understood as analogous to certain forms of angels: \nHowever, Strassman's experimental participants also note that some other entities can subjectively resemble creatures more like insects and aliens. As a result, Strassman writes these experiences among his experimental participants \"also left me feeling confused and concerned about where the spirit molecule was leading us. It was at this point that I began to wonder if I was getting in over my head with this research.\"\nHallucinations of strange creatures had been reported by Stephen Szara in a 1958 study in psychotic patients, in which he described how one of his subjects under the influence of DMT had experienced \"strange creatures, dwarves or something\" at the beginning of a DMT trip.\nOther researchers of the entities seemingly encountered by DMT users describe them as \"entities\" or \"beings\" in humanoid as well as animal form, with descriptions of \"little people\" being common (non-human gnomes, elves, imps, etc.). Strassman and others have speculated that this form of hallucination may be the cause of alien abduction and extraterrestrial encounter experiences, which may occur through endogenously-occurring DMT.\nLikening them to descriptions of rattling and chattering auditory phenomenon described in encounters with the Hayyoth in the Book of Ezekiel, Rick Strassman notes that participants in his studies, when reporting encounters with the alleged entities, have also described loud auditory hallucinations, such as one subject reporting typically \"the elves laughing or talking at high volume, chattering, twittering\".\nPhysiological response.\nAccording to a dose-response study in human subjects, dimethyltryptamine administered intravenously slightly elevated blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter, and rectal temperature, in addition to elevating blood concentrations of beta-endorphin, corticotropin, cortisol, and prolactin; growth hormone blood levels rise equally in response to all doses of DMT, and melatonin levels were unaffected.\"\nDependence liability.\nThe dependence potential of DMT and the risk of sustained psychological disturbance may be minimal when used infrequently, as in religious ceremonies; however, the physiological dependence potential of DMT and ayahuasca has not yet been documented convincingly.\nConjecture regarding endogenous effects.\nIn the 1950s, the endogenous production of psychoactive agents was considered to be a potential explanation for the hallucinatory symptoms of some psychiatric diseases; this is known as the transmethylation hypothesis. Several speculative and yet untested hypotheses suggest that endogenous DMT is produced in the human brain and is involved in certain psychological and neurological states. DMT is naturally occurring in small amounts in rat brain, human cerebrospinal fluid, and other tissues of humans and other mammals. Further, mRNA for the enzyme necessary for the production of DMT, INMT, are expressed in the human cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, and pineal gland, suggesting an endogenous role in the human brain. In 2011, Nicholas V. Cozzi, of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, concluded that INMT, an enzyme that is associated with the biosynthesis of DMT and endogenous hallucinogens, is present in the primate (rhesus macaque) pineal gland, retinal ganglion neurons, and spinal cord. Neurobiologist Andrew Gallimore (2013) suggested that while DMT might not have a modern neural function, it may have been an ancestral neuromodulator once secreted in psychedelic concentrations during REM sleep, a function now lost. \nRoutes of administration.\nInhalation.\nA standard dose for vaporized DMT is 20\u201360\u00a0milligrams. In general, this is inhaled in a few successive breaths. The effects last for a short period of time, usually 5 to 15 minutes, dependent on the dose. The onset after inhalation is very fast (less than 45 seconds) and peak effects are reached within a minute. In the 1960s, DMT was known as a \"business trip\" in the US because of the relatively short duration (and rapid onset) of action when inhaled. DMT can be inhaled using a bong or even an e-cigarette. A DMT-infused smoking blend is called Changa.\nInjection.\nIn a study conducted from 1990 through 1995, University of New Mexico psychiatrist Rick Strassman found that some volunteers injected with high doses of DMT reported experiences with perceived alien entities. Usually, the reported entities were experienced as the inhabitants of a perceived independent reality that the subjects reported visiting while under the influence of DMT.\nOral ingestion.\nDMT is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase through a process called deamination, and is quickly inactivated orally unless combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). The traditional South American beverage ayahuasca, or yage, is derived by boiling the ayahuasca vine (\"Banisteriopsis caapi\") with leaves of one or more plants containing DMT, such as \"Psychotria viridis\", \"Psychotria carthagenensis\", or \"Diplopterys cabrerana\". The Ayahuasca vine contains harmala alkaloids, highly active reversible inihibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs), rendering the DMT orally active by protecting it from deamination. A variety of different recipes are used to make the brew depending on the purpose of the ayahuasca session, or local availability of ingredients. Two common sources of DMT in the western US are reed canary grass (\"Phalaris arundinacea\") and Harding grass (\"Phalaris aquatica\"). These invasive grasses contain low levels of DMT and other alkaloids but also contain gramine, which is toxic and difficult to separate. In addition, Jurema (\"Mimosa tenuiflora\") shows evidence of DMT content: the pink layer in the inner rootbark of this small tree contains a high concentration of \"N,N\"-DMT.\nTaken orally with an RIMA, DMT produces a long lasting (over three hour), slow, deep metaphysical experience similar to that of psilocybin mushrooms, but more intense. RIMAs should be used with caution as they can have fatal interactions with some prescription drugs such as SSRI antidepressants, and some over-the-counter drugs known as sympathomimetics such as Ephedrine or certain cough medicines and even some herbal remedies .\nHistory.\nDMT has been used in South America since pre-Columbian times.\nDMT was first synthesized in 1931 by chemist Richard Helmuth Fredrick Manske (born 1901 in Berlin, Germany \u2013 1977). In general, its discovery as a natural product is credited to Brazilian chemist and microbiologist Oswaldo Gon\u00e7alves de Lima (1908\u20131989) who, in 1946, isolated an alkaloid he named \"nigerina\" (nigerine) from the root bark of \"jurema preta\", that is, \"Mimosa tenuiflora\". However, in a careful review of the case Jonathan Ott shows that the empirical formula for nigerine determined by Gon\u00e7alves de Lima, which notably contains an atom of oxygen, can match only a partial, \"impure\" or \"contaminated\" form of DMT. It was only in 1959, when Gon\u00e7alves de Lima provided American chemists a sample of \"Mimosa tenuiflora\" roots, that DMT was unequivocally identified in this plant material. Less ambiguous is the case of isolation and formal identification of DMT in 1955 in seeds and pods of \"Anadenanthera peregrina\" by a team of American chemists led by Evan Horning (1916\u20131993). Since 1955, DMT has been found in a host of organisms: in at least fifty plant species belonging to ten families, and in at least four animal species, including one gorgonian and three mammalian species (including humans).\nIn terms of a scientific understanding, the hallucinogenic properties of DMT were not uncovered until 1956 by Hungarian chemist and psychiatrist Stephen Szara. In his paper \u201cDimethyltryptamin: Its Metabolism in Man;\nthe Relation of its Psychotic Effect to the\nSerotonin Metabolism\u201d, Szara employed synthetic DMT, synthesized by the method of Speeter and Anthony, which was then administered to 20 volunteers by intramuscular injection. Urine samples were collected from these volunteers for the identification of DMT metabolites. This is considered to be the converging link between the chemical structure DMT to its cultural consumption as a psychoactive and religious sacrament.\nAnother historical milestone is the discovery of DMT in plants frequently used by Amazonian natives as additive to the vine \"Banisteriopsis caapi\" to make ayahuasca decoctions. In 1957, American chemists Francis Hochstein and Anita Paradies identified DMT in an \"aqueous extract\" of leaves of a plant they named \"Prestonia amazonicum\" [\"sic\"] and described as \"commonly mixed\" with \"B. caapi\". The lack of a proper botanical identification of \"Prestonia amazonica\" in this study led American ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes (1915\u20132001) and other scientists to raise serious doubts about the claimed plant identity. The mistake likely led the writer William Burroughs to regard the DMT he experimented with in Tangier in 1961 as \"Prestonia\". Better evidence was produced in 1965 by French pharmacologist Jacques Poisson, who isolated DMT as a sole alkaloid from leaves, provided and used by Agaruna Indians, identified as having come from the vine \"Diplopterys cabrerana\" (then known as \"Banisteriopsis rusbyana\"). Published in 1970, the first identification of DMT in the plant \"Psychotria viridis\", another common additive of ayahuasca, was made by a team of American researchers led by pharmacologist Ara der Marderosian. Not only did they detect DMT in leaves of \"P. viridis\" obtained from Kaxinaw\u00e1 indigenous people, but they also were the first to identify it in a sample of an ayahuasca decoction, prepared by the same indigenous people.\nLegal status.\nBy country and continent.\nSee also: Legal status of ayahuasca by country\nNorth America.\nIn 2017 the Santo Daime Church C\u00e9u do Montr\u00e9al received religious exemption to use Ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals.\nIn December 2004, the Supreme Court lifted a stay, thereby allowing the Brazil-based Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal (UDV) church to use a decoction containing DMT in their Christmas services that year. This decoction is a tea made from boiled leaves and vines, known as hoasca within the UDV, and ayahuasca in different cultures. In \"Gonzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal\", the Supreme Court heard arguments on November 1, 2005, and unanimously ruled in February 2006 that the U.S. federal government must allow the UDV to import and consume the tea for religious ceremonies under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\nIn September 2008, the three Santo Daime churches filed suit in federal court to gain legal status to import DMT-containing ayahuasca tea. The case, \"Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey\", presided over by Judge Owen M. Panner, was ruled in favor of the Santo Daime church. As of March 21, 2009, a federal judge says members of the church in Ashland can import, distribute and brew ayahuasca. U.S. District Judge Owen Panner issued a permanent injunction barring the government from prohibiting or penalizing the sacramental use of \"Daime tea\". Panner's order said activities of The Church of the Holy Light of the Queen are legal and protected under freedom of religion. His order prohibits the federal government from interfering with and prosecuting church members who follow a list of regulations set out in his order.\nChemistry.\nDMT is commonly handled and stored as a fumarate, as other DMT acid salts are extremely hygroscopic and will not readily crystallize. Its freebase form, although less stable than DMT fumarate, is favored by recreational users choosing to vaporize the chemical as it has a lower boiling point.\nBiosynthesis.\nDimethyltryptamine is an indole alkaloid derived from the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid L-tryptophan is produced endogenously where in animals L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid coming from diet. No matter the source of L-tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product \"N\"-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product \"N\",\"N\"-dimethyltryptamine. Tryptamine transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown \"ex vivo\" to be among the most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.\nThis transmethylation mechanism has been repeatedly and consistently proven by radiolabeling of SAM methyl group with carbon-14 (14C-CH3)SAM.\nLaboratory synthesis.\nDMT can be synthesized through several possible pathways from different starting materials. The two most commonly encountered synthetic routes are through the reaction of indole with oxalyl chloride followed by reaction with dimethylamine and reduction of the carbonyl functionalities with lithium aluminum hydride to form DMT. The second commonly encountered route is through the n,n-dimethylation of tryptamine using formaldehyde followed by reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Sodium borohydride can be used but requires a larger excess of reagents and lower temperatures due to it having a higher selectivity for carbonyl groups as opposed to imines. procedures using sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (presumably created in situ from cyanoborohydride though this may not be the case due to the presence of water and/or methanol) also result in the creation of cyanated tryptamine and beta-carboline by-products of unknown toxicity while using sodium borohydride in absence of acid does not. Bufotenine, a plant extract, can also be synthesized into DMT. Alternatively methyl iodide can be used but this results in the creation of a quaternary ammonium salt which must be transformed back into a tertiary amine.\nClandestine manufacture.\nIn a clandestine setting, DMT is not typically synthesized due to the lack of availability of the starting materials, namely tryptamine and oxalyl chloride. Instead, it is more often extracted from plant sources using a non-polar hydrocarbon solvent such as naphtha or heptane, and a base such as sodium hydroxide.\nAlternatively, an acid-base extraction is sometimes used instead.\nA variety of plants contain DMT at sufficient levels for being viable sources, but specific plants such as \"Mimosa tenuiflora\" and \"Acacia confusa\" are most often used.\nThe chemicals involved in the extraction are commonly available. The plant material may be illegal to procure in some countries. The end product (DMT) is illegal in most countries.\nEvidence in mammals.\nPublished in \"Science\" in 1961, Julius Axelrod found an \"N\"-methyltransferase enzyme capable of mediating biotransformation of tryptamine into DMT in a rabbit's lung. This finding initiated a still ongoing scientific interest in endogenous DMT production in humans and other mammals. From then on, two major complementary lines of evidence have been investigated: localization and further characterization of the \"N\"-methyltransferase enzyme, and analytical studies\u00a0looking for endogenously produced DMT in body fluids and tissues.\nIn 2013, researchers reported DMT in the pineal gland microdialysate of rodents.\nA study published in 2014 reported the biosynthesis of \"N,N\"-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in the human melanoma cell line SK-Mel-147 including details on its metabolism by peroxidases.\nIt is assumed that more than half of the amount of DMT produced by the acidophilic cells of the pineal gland is secreted before and during death, the amount being 0.0025-0.0034 g/kg. Other findings from studies still in research have shown through the ionization process that DMT can also produce during deep dreams in the REM stage.\nIn 2014, researchers demonstrated the immunomodulatory potential of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT through the Sigma-1 receptor of human immune cells. This immunomodulatory activity may contribute to significant anti-inflammatory effects and tissue regeneration.\nEndogenous DMT.\nThe first claimed detection of mammalian endogenous DMT was published in June 1965: German researchers F. Franzen and H. Gross report to have evidenced and quantified DMT, along with its structural analog bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), in human blood and urine. In an article published four months later, the method used in their study was strongly criticized, and the credibility of their results challenged.\nFew of the analytical methods used prior to 2001 to measure levels of endogenously formed DMT had enough sensitivity and selectivity to produce reliable results. Gas chromatography, preferably coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), is considered a minimum requirement. A study published in 2005 implements the most sensitive and selective method ever used to measure endogenous DMT: liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-ESI-MS/MS) allows for reaching limits of detection (LODs) 12 to 200 fold lower than those attained by the best methods employed in the 1970s. The data summarized in the table below are from studies conforming to the abovementioned requirements (abbreviations used: CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; LOD = limit of detection; n = number of samples; ng/L and ng/kg = nanograms (10\u22129 g) per litre, and nanograms per kilogram, respectively):\nA 2013 study found DMT in microdialysate obtained from a rat's pineal gland, providing evidence of endogenous DMT in the mammalian brain. In 2019 experiments showed that the rat brain is capable of synthesizing and releasing DMT. These results raise the possibility that this phenomenon may occur similarly in human brains.\nDetection in body fluids.\nDMT may be measured in blood, plasma or urine using chromatographic techniques as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. In general, blood or plasma DMT levels in recreational users of the drug are in the 10\u201330 \u03bcg/L range during the first several hours post-ingestion. Less than 0.1% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged in the 24-hour urine of humans.\nINMT.\nBefore techniques of molecular biology were used to localize indolethylamine \"N\"-methyltransferase (INMT), characterization and localization went on a par: samples of the biological material where INMT is hypothesized to be active are subject to enzyme assay. Those enzyme assays are performed either with a radiolabeled methyl donor like (14C-CH3)SAM to which known amounts of unlabeled substrates like tryptamine are added or with addition of a radiolabeled substrate like (14C)NMT to demonstrate in vivo formation. As qualitative determination of the radioactively tagged product of the enzymatic reaction is sufficient to characterize INMT existence and activity (or lack of), analytical methods used in INMT assays are not required to be as sensitive as those needed to directly detect and quantify the minute amounts of endogenously formed DMT (see DMT subsection below). The essentially qualitative method thin layer chromatography (TLC) was thus used in a vast majority of studies. Also, robust evidence that INMT can catalyze transmethylation of tryptamine into NMT and DMT could be provided with reverse isotope dilution analysis coupled to mass spectrometry for rabbit and human lung during the early 1970s.\nSelectivity rather than sensitivity proved to be an Achilles' heel for some TLC methods with the discovery in 1974\u20131975 that incubating rat blood cells or brain tissue with (14C-CH3)SAM and NMT as substrate mostly yields tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline derivatives, and negligible amounts of DMT in brain tissue. It is indeed simultaneously realized that the TLC methods used thus far in almost all published studies on INMT and DMT biosynthesis are incapable to resolve DMT from those tetrahydro-\u03b2-carbolines. These findings are a blow for all previous claims of evidence of INMT activity and DMT biosynthesis in avian and mammalian brain, including in vivo, as they all relied upon use of the problematic TLC methods: their validity is doubted in replication studies that make use of improved TLC methods, and fail to evidence DMT-producing INMT activity in rat and human brain tissues. Published in 1978, the last study attempting to evidence in vivo INMT activity and DMT production in brain (rat) with TLC methods finds biotransformation of radiolabeled tryptamine into DMT to be real but \"insignificant\". Capability of the method used in this latter study to resolve DMT from tetrahydro-\u03b2-carbolines is questioned later.\nTo localize INMT, a qualitative leap is accomplished with use of modern techniques of molecular biology, and of immunohistochemistry. In humans, a gene encoding INMT is determined to be located on chromosome 7. Northern blot analyses reveal INMT messenger RNA (mRNA) to be highly expressed in rabbit lung, and in human thyroid, adrenal gland, and lung. Intermediate levels of expression are found in human heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, testis, prostate, placenta, lymph node, and spinal cord. Low to very low levels of expression are noted in rabbit brain, and human thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, colon, ovary, and bone marrow. INMT mRNA expression is absent in human peripheral blood leukocytes, whole brain, and in tissue from 7 specific brain regions (thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, and corpus callosum). Immunohistochemistry showed INMT to be present in large amounts in glandular epithelial cells of small and large intestines. In 2011, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of INMT in primate nervous tissue including retina, spinal cord motor neurons, and pineal gland. A 2020 study using in-situ hybridization, a far more accurate tool than the northern blot analysis, found mRNA coding for INMT expressed in the human cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, and pineal gland. \nPharmacology.\nPharmacokinetics.\nDMT peak level concentrations (\"C\"max) measured in whole blood after intramuscular (IM) injection (0.7\u00a0mg/kg, n = 11) and in plasma following intravenous (IV) administration (0.4\u00a0mg/kg, n = 10) of fully psychedelic doses are in the range of \u224814 to 154 \u03bcg/L and 32 to 204 \u03bcg/L, respectively.\nThe corresponding molar concentrations of DMT are therefore in the range of 0.074\u20130.818 \u03bcM in whole blood and 0.170\u20131.08 \u03bcM in plasma. However, several studies have described active transport and accumulation of DMT into rat and dog brain following peripheral administration.\nSimilar active transport, and accumulation processes likely occur in human brain and may concentrate DMT in brain by several-fold or more (relatively to blood), resulting in local concentrations in the micromolar or higher range. Such concentrations would be commensurate with serotonin brain tissue concentrations, which have been consistently determined to be in the 1.5-4 \u03bcM range.\nClosely coextending with peak psychedelic effects, mean time to reach peak concentrations (\"T\"max) was determined to be 10\u201315 minutes in whole blood after IM injection, and 2 minutes in plasma after IV administration. When taken orally mixed in an ayahuasca decoction, and in freeze-dried ayahuasca gel caps, DMT \"T\"max is considerably delayed: 107.59 \u00b1 32.5 minutes, and 90\u2013120 minutes, respectively.\nThe pharmacokinetics for vaporizing DMT have not been studied or reported.\nPharmacodynamics.\nDMT binds non-selectively with affinities &lt; 0.6 \u03bcM to the following serotonin receptors: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. An agonist action has been determined at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C. Its efficacies at other serotonin receptors remain to be determined. Of special interest will be the determination of its efficacy at human 5-HT2B receptor as two \"in vitro\" assays evidenced DMT's high affinity for this receptor: 0.108 \u03bcM and 0.184 \u03bcM. This may be of importance because chronic or frequent uses of serotonergic drugs showing preferential high affinity and clear agonism at 5-HT2B receptor have been causally linked to valvular heart disease.\nIt has also been shown to possess affinity for the dopamine D1, \u03b11-adrenergic, \u03b12-adrenergic, imidazoline-1, and \u03c31 receptors. Converging lines of evidence established activation of the \u03c31 receptor at concentrations of 50\u2013100 \u03bcM. Its efficacies at the other receptor binding sites are unclear. It has also been shown \"in vitro\" to be a substrate for the cell-surface serotonin transporter (SERT) expressed in human platelets, and the rat vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which was transiently expressed in fall armyworm Sf9 cells. DMT inhibited SERT-mediated serotonin uptake into platelets at an average concentration of 4.00 \u00b1 0.70 \u03bcM and VMAT2-mediated serotonin uptake at an average concentration of 93 \u00b1 6.8 \u03bcM.\nAs with other so-called \"classical hallucinogens\", a large part of DMT psychedelic effects can be attributed to a functionally selective activation of the 5-HT2A receptor. DMT concentrations eliciting 50% of its maximal effect (half maximal effective concentration = EC50 or Kact) at the human 5-HT2A receptor \"in vitro\" are in the 0.118\u20130.983 \u03bcM range. This range of values coincides well with the range of concentrations measured in blood and plasma after administration of a fully psychedelic dose (see Pharmacokinetics).\nAs DMT has been shown to have slightly better efficacy (EC50) at human serotonin 2C receptor than at the 2A receptor, 5-HT2C is also likely implicated in DMT's overall effects. Other receptors, such as 5-HT1A \u03c31, may also play a role.\nIn 2009, it was hypothesized that DMT may be an endogenous ligand for the \u03c31 receptor. The concentration of DMT needed for \u03c31 activation \"in vitro\" (50\u2013100 \u03bcM) is similar to the behaviorally active concentration measured in mouse brain of approximately 106 \u03bcM This is minimally 4 orders of magnitude higher than the average concentrations measured in rat brain tissue or human plasma under basal conditions (see Endogenous DMT), so \u03c31 receptors are likely to be activated only under conditions of high local DMT concentrations. If DMT is stored in synaptic vesicles, such concentrations might occur during vesicular release. To illustrate, while the \"average\" concentration of serotonin in brain tissue is in the 1.5\u20134 \u03bcM range, the concentration of serotonin in synaptic vesicles was measured at 270 mM. Following vesicular release, the resulting concentration of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, to which serotonin receptors are exposed, is estimated to be about 300 \u03bcM. Thus, while \"in vitro\" receptor binding affinities, efficacies, and average concentrations in tissue or plasma are useful, they are not likely to predict DMT concentrations in the vesicles or at synaptic or intracellular receptors. Under these conditions, notions of receptor selectivity are moot, and it seems probable that most of the receptors identified as targets for DMT (see above) participate in producing its psychedelic effects.\nSociety and culture.\nBlack market.\nElectronic cigarette cartridges filled with DMT started to be sold on the black market in 2018."}

But in larger works, D.C. might occur after one or more repeats of small sections, indicating a return to the very beginning. The resulting structure of the piece is generally in ternary form. Sometimes, the composer describes the part to be repeated, for example: \"Menuet da capo\". In opera, where an aria of this structure is called a \"da capo aria\", the repeated section is often adorned with grace notes.\nThe word \"Fine\" (Ital.

{"id": "8751", "revid": "38976744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8751", "title": "Dominatrix", "text": "A dominatrix (, plural dominatrices ) is a woman who takes the dominant role in BDSM activities. A dominatrix might be of any sexual orientation, but her orientation does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. The role of a dominatrix may not even involve physical pain toward the submissive; her domination can be verbal, involving humiliating tasks, or servitude. A dominatrix is typically a paid professional (\"pro-domme\") as the term \"dominatrix\" is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene.\nThe term \"domme\" is likely a coined pseudo-French feminine inflection of the slang \"dom\" (short for \"dominant\"). The use of \"domme\", \"dominatrix\", \"dom\", or \"dominant\" by any woman in a dominant role is chosen mostly by personal preference and the conventions of the local BDSM scene. The term \"mistress\" or dominant mistress is sometimes also used. Female dominance (also known as female domination or femdom) is a BDSM activity in which the dominant partner is female.\nDepictions of dominatrices in film and television are common, almost always featuring a professional dominatrix.\nEtymology.\n\"Dominatrix\" is the feminine form of the Latin \"dominator\", a ruler or lord, and was originally used in a non-sexual sense. Its use in English dates back to at least 1561. Its earliest recorded use in the prevalent modern sense, as a female dominant in S&amp;M, dates to 1961. It was initially coined to describe a woman who provides punishment-for-pay as one of the case studies within Bruce Roger's pulp paperback \"The Bizarre Lovemakers\". The term was taken up shortly after by the Myron Kosloff title \"Dominatrix\" (with art by Eric Stanton) in 1968, and entered more popular mainstream knowledge following the 1976 film \"Dominatrix Without Mercy\".\nAlthough the term \"dominatrix\" was not used, the classic example in literature of the female dominant-male submissive relationship is portrayed in the 1870 novella \"Venus in Furs\" by Austrian writer Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The term \"masochism\" was later derived from the author's name by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in the latter's 1886 forensic study \"Psychopathia Sexualis\".\nHistory.\nThe history of the dominatrix is argued to date back to rituals of the Goddess Inanna (or Ishtar as she was known in Akkadian), in ancient Mesopotamia. Ancient cuneiform texts consisting of \"Hymns to Inanna\" have been cited as examples of the archetype of powerful, sexual female displaying dominating behaviors and forcing Gods and men into submission to her. Archaeologist and historian Anne O. Nomis notes that Inanna's rituals included cross-dressing of cult personnel, and rituals \"imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initiation and journeys of altered consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves with weeping and grief.\"\nThe tale of Phyllis and Aristotle, which became popular and gained numerous versions from the 12th century onwards, tells the story of a dominant woman who seduced and dominated the male intellect of the greatest philosopher. In the story, Phyllis forces Aristotle to kneel on the ground so that she rides on his back while whipping and verbally humiliating him.\nThe profession appears to have originated as a specialization within brothels, before becoming its own unique craft. As far back as the 1590s, flagellation within an erotic setting is recorded. The profession features in erotic prints of the era, such as the British Museum mezzotint \"The Cully Flaug'd\" (c. 1674\u20131702), and in accounts of forbidden books which record the flogging schools and the activities practised.\nWithin the 18th century, female \"Birch Disciplinarians\" advertised their services in a book masked as a collection of lectures or theatrical plays, entitled \"Fashionable Lectures\" (c. 1761). This included the names of 57 women, some actresses and courtesans, who catered to birch discipline fantasies, keeping a room with rods and cat o' nine tails, and charging their clients a Guinea for a \"lecture\".\nThe 19th century is characterised by what historian Anne O. Nomis characterises as the \"Golden Age of the Governess\". No fewer than twenty establishments were documented as having existed by the 1840s, supported entirely by flagellation practices and known as \"Houses of Discipline\" distinct from brothels. Amongst the well-known \"dominatrix governesses\" were Mrs Chalmers, Mrs Noyeau, the late Mrs Jones of Hertford Street and London Street, the late Mrs Theresa Berkley, Bessy Burgess of York Square and Mrs Pyree of Burton Cres. The most famous of these Governess \"female flagellants\" was Theresa Berkley, who operated her establishment on Charlotte Street in the central London district of Marylebone. She is recorded to have used implements such as whips, canes and birches, to chastise and punish her male clients, as well as the Berkley Horse, a specially designed flogging machine, and a pulley suspension system for lifting them off the floor. Such historical use of corporal punishment and suspension, in a setting of domination roleplay, connects very closely to the practices of modern-day professional dominatrices.\nThe \"bizarre style\" (as it came to be called) of leather catsuits, claws, tail whips, and latex rubber only came about in the 20th century, initially within commercial fetish photography, and taken up by dominatrices. Within the mid-20th century, dominatrices operated in a very discreet and underground manner, which has made them difficult to trace within the historical record. A few photographs still exist of the women who ran their domination businesses in London, New York, The Hague and Hamburg's Herbertstra\u00dfe, predominantly in sepia and black-and-white photographs, and scans from magazine articles, copied and re-copied. Amongst these were Miss Doreen of London who was acquainted with John Sutcliffe of \"AtomAge\" fame, whose clients reportedly included Britain's top politicians and businessmen. In New York, the dominatrix Anne Laurence was known within the underground circle of acquaintances during the 1950s, with Monique Von Cleef arriving in the early 1960s, and hitting national headlines when her home was raided by police detectives on 22 December 1965. Von Cleef went on to set up her \"House of Pain\" in The Hague in the 1970s, which became one of the world capitals for dominatrices, reportedly with visiting lawyers, ambassadors, diplomats and politicians. Domenica Niehoff worked as a dominatrix in Hamburg and appeared on talk shows on German television from the 1970s onwards, campaigning for sex workers' rights. Mistress Raven, founder and manager of Pandora's Box, one of New York's best known BDSM studios, was featured in Nick Broomfield's 1996 documentary film \"Fetishes\".\nProfessional vs. personal.\nThe term \"dominatrix\" is mostly used to describe a female professional dominant (or \"pro-domme\") who is paid to engage in BDSM play with a submissive. Professional dominatrices are not prostitutes, despite the sensual and erotic interactions she has. An appointment or roleplay is referred to as a \"session\", and is often conducted in a dedicated professional play space which has been set up with specialist equipment, known as a \"dungeon\". Sessions may also be conducted remotely by letter or telephone, or in the contemporary era of technological connectivity by email, online chat or platforms such as OnlyFans. Most, but not all, clients of female professional dominants are men. Male professional dominants also exist, catering predominantly to the gay male market.\nWomen who engage in female domination typically promote and title themselves under the terms \"dominatrix\", \"mistress\", \"lady\", \"madame\", \"herrin\" or \"goddess\". In a study of German dominatrices, Andrew Wilson said that the trend for dominatrices choosing names aimed at creating and maintaining an atmosphere in which class, femininity and mystery are key elements of their self-constructed identity.\nSome professional dominatrices set minimum age limits for their clients. Popular requests from clients are for dungeon play including bondage, spanking and cock and ball torture, or for medical play using hoods, gas masks and urethral sounding. Verbal erotic humiliation, such as small penis humiliation, is also popular. It is not unusual for a dominatrix to consider her profession different from that of an escort and not perform tie and tease or \"happy endings\". Typically professional dominatrices do not have sexual intercourse with their clients, do not become naked with their clients and do not allow their clients to touch them. The Canadian dominatrix Terri-Jean Bedford, who was one of three women who initiated an application in the Ontario Superior Court seeking invalidation of Canada's laws regarding brothels, sought to differentiate for clarity her occupation as a dominatrix rather than a prostitute to the media, due to frequent misunderstanding and conflation by the public of the two terms.\nThat being said, it is now generally accepted that a professional dominatrix is a sex worker, and many of the acts conducted during a session may be interpreted as equally sexual to the participants.\nWhile dominatrices come from many different backgrounds, it has been shown that a considerable number are well-educated. Research into US dominatrices published in 2012 indicated that 39% of the sample studied had received some sort of graduate training.\nA 1985 study suggested that about 30 percent of participants in BDSM subculture were female. A 1994 report indicated that around a quarter of the women who took part in BDSM subculture did so professionally. In a 1995 study of Internet discussion group messages, the preference for the dominant-initiator role was expressed by 11% of messages by heterosexual women, compared to 71% of messages by heterosexual men.\nProfessional dominatrices can be seen advertising their services online and in print publications which carry erotic services advertising, such as contact magazines and fetish magazines that specialise in female domination. The precise number of women actively offering professional domination services is unknown. Most professional dominatrices practice in large metropolitan cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and London, with as many as 200 women working as dominatrices in Los Angeles.\nProfessional dominatrices may take pride or differentiation in their psychological insight into their clients' fetishes and desires, as well as their technical ability to perform complex BDSM practices, such as Japanese shibari, head-scissoring, and other forms of bondage, suspension, torture roleplay, and corporal punishment, and other such practices which require a high degree of knowledge and competency to safely oversee. From a sociological point of view, Danielle Lindemann has stated the \"embattled purity regime\" in which many pro-dommes emphasise their specialist knowledge and professional skills, while distancing themselves from economic criteria for success, in a way which is comparable to avant-garde artists.\nSome dominatrices practice financial domination, or findom, a fetish in which a submissive is aroused by sending money or gifts to a dominatrix at her instruction. In some cases the dominatrix is given control of the submissive's finances or a \"blackmail\" scenario is acted out. In the majority of cases the dominatrix and the submissive do not physically meet. The interactions are typically performed using the Internet, which is also where such services are advertised. Findom was originally a niche service that a traditional dominatrix would offer, but it has become popular with less-experienced online practitioners.\nTo differentiate women who identify as a dominatrix but do not offer paid services, non-professional dominants are occasionally referred to as a \"lifestyle\" dominatrix or Mistress. The term \"lifestyle\" to signify BDSM is occasionally a contention topic in the BDSM community and that some dominatrices may dislike the term. Some professional dominatrices are also \"lifestyle\" dominatrices - i.e., in addition to paid sessions with submissive clients they engage in unpaid recreational sessions or may incorporate power exchange within their own private lives and relationships. However, the term has fallen out of general usage with respect to women who are dominant in their private relationships, and has taken on more and more, the connotation of \"professional.\"\nNotable dominatrices.\nCatherine Robbe-Grillet is a personal dominatrix. Born in Paris on September 24, 1930, she then became France's most famous dominatrix. She is also a writer and actress, the widow of nouveau roman pioneer and sadist Alain Robbe-Grillet. She currently lives with Beverly Charpentier, a 51-year-old South African woman who is her submissive companion. Although being such a famous dominatrix, she has never accepted payment for her \"ceremonies\". She's quoted as saying \"If someone pays, then they are in charge. I need to remain free. It is important that everyone involved knows that I do it solely for my pleasure.\" \"Catherine is my secret garden,\u201d Charpentier says. \"I have given myself to her, body and soul. She does whatever she wants, whenever she wants, with either or both, according to her pleasure\u2014and her pleasure is also my pleasure.\" Catherine has always been heavily censored in her novels for writing about S/M stories. She identifies as a \u201cpro-sex feminist\u201d and \u201cthe kind of feminist who supports the right of any man or women to work as a prostitute, if it is their free choice.\u201d\nImagery.\nThe dominatrix is a female archetype which operates on a symbolic mode of representation, associated with particular attire and props that are drawn on within popular culture to signify her role\u2014as a strong, dominant, sexualised woman\u2014linked to but distinct from images of sexual fetish. During the twentieth century, the imagery associated with dominatrices was developed by the work of a number of artists including the costume designer and photographer Charles Guyette, the publisher and film director Irving Klaw, and the illustrators Eric Stanton and Gene Bilbrew who drew for the fetish magazine Exotique.\nOne of the garments commonly associated with the dominatrix is the catsuit. Historically, the black leather female catsuit entered dominant fetish culture in the 1950s with the \"AtomAge\" magazine and its connections to fetish fashion designer John Sutcliffe. The spill-over into mainstream culture, occurred with catsuits being worn by strong female protagonists in popular 1960s TV programs like \"The Avengers\", and in the comic super-heroines such as Catwoman, in which the catsuit represented the independent woman capable of \"kick-ass\" moves and antics, enabling complete freedom of movement. On another level, the one-piece catsuit accentuated and exaggerated the sexualized female form, providing visual access to a woman's body, while simultaneously obstructing physical penetrative access. \"You can look but you can't touch\" is the mechanism of this operation, which plays upon the BDSM practice known as \"tease and denial\".\nOther common signifying footwear of the dominatrix are thigh-high boots in leather or shiny PVC, which have long held a fetishistic status and are sometimes called kinky boots, along with the very high stiletto heel. Fishnet stockings, seamed hosiery, and stockings and garter belts (suspenders) are also popular accents in the representation and attire of dominatrices, to emphasize the form and length of their legs, with erotic connotation.\nTight, leather corsets are another staple garment of the dominatrix signification. Gloves, whether long opera gloves or fingerless gloves, are often a further accessory to emphasize the feminine role. Neck corsets may also be worn.\nDominatrices often wear clothing made from fetish fashion materials. Examples include PVC clothing, latex clothing and garments drawn from the leather subculture. In some cases elements of dominatrix attire, such as leather boots and peaked cap, are drawn from Nazi chic, particularly the black SS officer's uniform which has been widely adopted and fetishized by underground gay and BDSM lifestyle groups to satisfy a uniform fetish.\nThe body language of the dominatrix is frequently represented by the use of strong, dominant body-language which is comparable to the dominant posturing in the animal world. The props she may brandish will strongly signify her role as dominatrix, such as bearing a flogger, whip or riding crop as illustrated in the artwork of Bruno Zach in the early 20th century, in conventional representation.\n Practicing professional dominatrices may draw their attire from the conventional signifiers of the role, or adapt them to create their own individual style, where there exists a potential pull\u2014between meeting conventional expectations, and a desire for dominant independent self-expression. Some contemporary dominatrices draw upon an eclectic range of strong female archetypes, including the goddess, the female superheroine, the femme fatale, the priestess, the empress, the queen, the governess, the KGB secret agent, to their own ends.\nLiterature.\nThemes associated with the dominatrix character have appeared in literature since the 10th century. Canoness Hroswitha, in her manuscript \"Maria,\" uses the word \"Dominatrix\" for the main character. She is portrayed as an unattainable woman who is too good for any of the men who are in love with her. The theme of \"the unattainable woman\" has been used thoroughly in medieval literature as well, although it differs from a dominatrix. Medieval themes surrounding the unattainable woman concerned issues of social classes and structure, with chivalry being a prime part of a relationship between a man and woman. There are some exceptions to this trend during medieval times. In Cervantes\u2019 \"Don Quixote\" (1605), Celadon is imprisoned by Galatea. Celadon complains that his \u201cmistress . . . Galatea keeps me on such a short leash\u201d. Robert Herrick published in 1648, Hesperides. In it there were three revealing poems \"An Hymne to Love\", \"The Dream\", and \"To Love\" which showcase masculine longing for domination, restraint, discipline. In \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce, the character Bloom has many fantasies of submission to a lady and to receive whippings by her.\nIn popular culture.\nDepictions of dominatrices in popular culture include:\nFemale domination is also depicted in the novels \"Love Story in the Style of Femdom\" (2018) and \"Our Wild Sex in Malindi\" (2020) by the Russian writer Andrei Gusev."}

An origin legend with considerable impact on Danish national historiography connects the introduction of the flag to the Battle of Lindanise of 1219. \nThe elongated Nordic cross reflects the use as a maritime flag in the 18th century. The flag became popular as a national flag in the early 16th century. Its private use was outlawed in 1834, and again permitted in a regulation of 1854. The flag holds the world record of being the oldest continuously used national flag.\nDescription.\nIn 1748, a regulation defined the correct lengths of the two last fields in the flag as .\nIn May 1893 a new regulation to all chiefs of police, stated that the police should not intervene, if the two last fields in the flag were longer than as long as these did not exceed , and provided that this was the only rule violated.\nThis regulation is still in effect today and thus the legal proportions of the National flag is today 3:1:3 in width and anywhere between 3:1:4.5 and 3:1:5.25 in length.\nNo official definition of \"Dannebrog r\u00f8d\" exists. The private company \"Dansk Standard\", regulation number 359 (2005), defines the red colour of the flag as Pantone 186c.\nHistory.\n1219 origin legend.\nA tradition recorded in the 16th century traces the origin of the flag to the campaigns of Valdemar II of Denmark (r. 1202\u20131241). The oldest of them is in Christiern Pedersen's \"Danske Kr\u00f8nike\", which is a sequel to Saxo's Gesta Danorum, written 1520\u201323. Here, the flag falls from the sky during a Russian campaign of Valdemar's. Pedersen also states that the very same flag was taken into exile by Eric of Pomerania in 1440.\nThe second source is the writing of the Franciscan friar Petrus Olai (Peder Olsen) of Roskilde (died c. 1570). This record describes a battle in 1208 near Fellin during the Estonia campaign of King Valdemar II. The Danes were all but defeated when a lamb-skin banner depicting a white cross fell from the sky and miraculously led to a Danish victory. In a third account, also by Petrus Olai, in \"Danmarks Tolv Herligheder\" (\"Twelve Splendours of Denmark\"), in splendour number nine, the same story is re-told almost verbatim, with a paragraph inserted correcting the year to 1219. Now, the flag is falling from the sky in the Battle of Lindanise, also known as the Battle of Valdemar (Danish: \"Volmerslaget\"), near Lindanise (Tallinn) in Estonia, of 15 June 1219.\nIt is this third account that has been the most influential, and some historians have treated it as the primary account taken from a (lost) source dating to the first half of the 15th century.\nIn Olai's account, the battle was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen on top of a hill overlooking the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.\nThe possible historical nucleus behind this origin legend was extensively discussed by Danish historians in the 19th to 20th centuries. J\u00f8rgensen (1875) argues that Bishop Theoderich was the original instigator of the 1218 inquiry from Bishop Albert of Buxhoeveden to King Valdemar II which led to the Danish participation in the Baltic crusades. J\u00f8rgensen speculates that Bishop Theoderich might have carried the Knight Hospitaller's banner in the 1219 battle and that \"the enemy thought this was the King's symbol and mistakenly stormed Bishop Theoderich tent. He claims that the origin of the legend of the falling flag comes from this confusion in the battle.\"\nThe Danish church-historian L. P. Fabricius (1934) ascribes the origin to the 1208 Battle of Fellin, not the Battle of Lindanise in 1219, based on the earliest source available about the story. Fabricius speculated that it might have been Archbishop Andreas Sunes\u00f8n's personal ecclesiastical banner or perhaps even the flag of Archbishop Absalon, under whose initiative and supervision several smaller crusades had already been conducted in Estonia. The banner would then already be known in Estonia. Fabricius repeats J\u00f8rgensen's idea about the flag being planted in front of Bishop Theodorik's tent, which the enemy mistakenly attacks believing it to be the tent of the King.\nA different theory is briefly discussed by Fabricius and elaborated more by Helge Bruhn (1949). Bruhn interprets the story in the context of the widespread tradition of the miraculous appearance of crosses in the sky in Christian legend, specifically comparing such an event attributed to a battle of 10 September 1217 near Alcazar, where it is said that a golden cross on white appeared in the sky, to bring victory to the Christians.\nIn Swedish national historiography of the 18th century, there is a tale paralleling the Danish legend, in which \na golden cross appears in the blue sky during a Swedish battle in Finland in 1157.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe white-on-red cross emblem originates in the age of the Crusades. In the 12th century, it was also used as war flag by the Holy Roman Empire.\nIn the \"Gelre Armorial\", dated 1340\u20131370, such a banner is shown alongside the coat of arms of the king of Denmark. This is the earliest known undisputed colour rendering of the Dannebrog. At about the same time, Valdemar IV of Denmark displays a cross in his coat of arms on his \"Dan\u00e6log\" seal (\"Rettertingsseglet\", dated 1356). The image from the Armorial Gelre is nearly identical to an image found in a 15th-century coats of arms book now located in the National Archives of Sweden (\"Riksarkivet\"). The seal of Eric of Pomerania (1398) as king of the Kalmar union displays the arms of Denmark chief dexter, three lions. In this version, the lions are holding a Dannebrog banner.\nThe reason why the kings of Denmark in the 14th century begin displaying the cross banner in their coats of arms is unknown. Caspar Paludan-M\u00fcller (1873) suggested that it may reflect a banner sent by the pope to the Danish king in support of the Baltic countries. Adolf Ditlev J\u00f8rgensen (1875) identifies the banner as that of the Knights Hospitaller, which order had a presence in Denmark from the later 12th century.\nSeveral coins, seals and images exist, both foreign and domestic, from the 13th to 15th centuries and even earlier, showing heraldic designs similar to Dannebrog, alongside the royal coat of arms (three blue lions on a golden shield.)\nThere is a record suggesting that the Danish army had a \"chief banner\" (\"hoffuitbanner\") in the early 16th century. Such a banner is mentioned in 1570 by Niels Hemmings\u00f8n in the context of a 1520 battle between Danes and Swedes near Uppsala as nearly captured by the Swedes but saved by the heroic actions of the banner-carrier Mogens Gyldenstierne and Peder Skram. The legend attributing the miraculous origin of the flag to the campaigns of Valdemar II of Denmark (r. 1202\u20131241) were recorded by Christiern Pedersen and Petrus Olai in the 1520s.\nHans Svaning's \"History of King Hans\" from 1558 to 1559 and Johan Rantzau's \"History about the Last Dithmarschen War\", from 1569, record the further fate of the Danish \"hoffuitbanner\": According to this tradition, the original flag from the Battle of Lindanise was used in the small campaign of 1500 when King Hans tried to conquer Dithmarschen (in western Holstein in north Germany). The flag was lost in a devastating defeat at the Battle of Hemmingstedt on 17 February 1500. In 1559, King Frederik II recaptured it during his own Dithmarschen campaign.\nIn 1576, the son of \"Johan Rantzau\", Henrik Rantzau, also writes about the war and the fate of the flag, noting that the flag was in a poor condition when returned. He records that the flag after its return to Denmark was placed in the cathedral in Slesvig. Slesvig historian Ulrik Petersen (1656\u20131735) confirms the presence of such a banner in the cathedral in the early 17th century, and records that it had crumbled away by about 1660.\nContemporary records describing the battle of Hemmingstedt make no reference to the loss of the original Dannebrog, although the capitulation state that all Danish banners lost in 1500 were to be returned. In a letter dated 22 February 1500 to Oluf Stigs\u00f8n, King John describes the battle, but does not mention the loss of an important flag. In fact, the entire letter gives the impression that the lost battle was of limited importance. In 1598, Neocorus wrote that the banner captured in 1500 was brought to the church in W\u00f6hrden and hung there for the next 59 years, until it was returned to the Danes as part of the peace settlement in 1559.\nModern period.\nUsed as maritime flag since the 16th century, the Dannebrog was introduced as regimental flag in the Danish army in 1785, and for the militia (landev\u00e6rn) in 1801. From 1842, it was used as the flag of the entire army.\nIn parallel to the development of Romantic nationalism in other European countries, the military flag increasingly came to be seen as representing the nation itself during the first half of the 19th century. Poems of this period invoking the \"Dannebrog\" were written by B.S. Ingemann, N.F.S. Grundtvig, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, Chr. Winther and H.C. Andersen. By the 1830s, the military flag had become so popular as unofficial national flag, and its use by private citizens was outlawed in a circular enacted on 7 January 1834.\nIn the national enthusiasm sparked by the First Schleswig War during 1848\u20131850, the flag was still very widely displayed, and the prohibition of private use was again repealed in a regulation of 7 July 1854, for the first time allowing Danish citizens to display the Dannebrog (but not the swallow-tailed \"Splitflag\" variant). Special permission to use the \"Splitflag\" was given to individual institutions and private companies, especially after 1870. On 10 April 1915, the hoisting of any \"other\" flag on Danish soil was prohibited. In 1886, the war ministry introduced a regulation indicating that the flag should be flown from military buildings on thirteen specified days, including royal birthdays, the date of the signing of the Constitution of 5 June 1849 and on days of remembrance for military battles. In 1913, the naval ministry issued its own list of flag days. From 1939 until 2012, the yearbook \"Hvem-Hvad-Hvor\" included a list of flag days. As of 2019 flag days can be viewed at the \"Ministry of Justice (Justitsministeriet)\" as well as \"The Denmark Society (Danmarks-Samfundet)\".\nVariants.\nMaritime flag and corresponding Kingdom flag.\nThe size and shape of the civil ensign (\"\"Koffardiflaget\") for merchant ships is given in the regulation of 11 June 1748, which says: \"A red flag with a white cross with no split end. The white cross must be of the flag's height. The two first fields must be square in form and the two outer fields must be lengths of those\". The proportions are thus: 3:1:3 vertically and 3:1:4.5 horizontally. This definition are the absolute proportions for the Danish national flag to this day, for both the civil version of the flag (\"Stutflaget\"), as well as the merchant flag (\"Handelsflaget\"\"). The civil flag and the merchant flag are identical in colour and design.\nA regulation passed in 1758 required Danish ships sailing in the Mediterranean to carry the royal cypher in the center of the flag in order to distinguish them from Maltese ships, due to the similarity of the flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.\nAccording to the regulation of 11 June 1748 the colour was simply red, which is common known today as \"Dannebrog r\u00f8d\" (\"\"Dannebrog red\"). The only available red fabric dye in 1748 was made of madder root, which can be processed to produce a brilliant red dye (used historically for British soldiers' jackets). A regulation of 4 May 1927 once again states that Danish merchant ships have to fly flags according to the regulation of 1748.\nThe first regulation regarding the \"Splitflag\" dates from 27 March 1630, in which King Christian IV orders that Norwegian \"Defensionskibe\" (armed merchants ships) may only use the \"Splitflag\" if they are in Danish war service. In 1685 an order, distributed to a number of cities in Slesvig, states that all ships must carry the Danish flag, and in 1690 all merchant ships are forbidden to use the \"Splitflag\", with the exception of ships sailing in the East Indies, West Indies and along the coast of Africa. In 1741 it is confirmed that the regulation of 1690 is still very much in effect; that merchant ships may not use the \"Splitflag\". At the same time the Danish East India Company is allowed to fly the \"Splitflag\" when past the equator.\nSome confusion must have existed regarding the \"Splitflag\". In 1696 the Admiralty presented the King with a proposal for a standard regulating both size and shape of the \"Splitflag\". In the same year a royal resolution defines the proportions of the \"Splitflag\", which in this resolution is called \"Kongeflaget\" (the King's flag), as follows: \"The cross must be of the flags height. The two first fields must be square in form with the sides three times the cross width. The two outer fields are rectangular and the length of the square fields. The tails are the length of the flag\".\nThese numbers are the basic for the \"Splitflag\", or \"Orlogsflag\", today, though the numbers have been slightly altered. The term \"Orlogsflag\" dates from 1806 and denotes use in the Danish Navy.\nFrom about 1750 to the early 19th century, a number of ships and companies which the government has interests in, received approval to use the \"Splitflag\".\nIn the royal resolution of 25 October 1939 for the Danish Navy, it is stated that the \"Orlogsflag\" is a \"Splitflag\" with a deep red (\"dybr\u00f8d\") or madder red (\"krapr\u00f8d\"\") colour. Like the National flag, no nuance is given, but in modern days this is given as 195U. Furthermore, the size and shape is corrected in this resolution to be: \"The cross must be of the flag's height. The two first fields must be square in form with the height of of the flag's height. The two outer fields are rectangular and the length of the square fields. The tails are the length of the rectangular fields\". Thus, if compared to the standard of 1696, both the rectangular fields and the tails have decreased in size.\nThe \"Splitflag\" and \"Orlogsflag\" have similar shapes but different sizes and shades of red. Legally, they are two different flags. The \"Splitflag\" is a Danish flag ending in a swallow-tail, it is \"Dannebrog red\", and is used on land. The \"Orlogsflag\" is an elongated \"Splitflag\" with a deeper red colour and is only used on sea.\nThe \"Orlogsflag\" with no markings, may only be used by the Royal Danish Navy. There are though a few exceptions to this. A few institutions have been allowed to fly the clean \"Orlogsflag\". The same flag with markings has been approved for a few dozen companies and institutions over the years.\nFurthermore, the \"Orlogsflag\" is only described as such if it has no additional markings. Any swallow-tail flag, no matter the color, is called a \"Splitflag\" provided it bears additional markings.\nRoyal standards.\nThe current version of the royal standard was introduced on 16 November 1972 when the Queen adopted a new version of her personal coat of arms. The royal standard is the flag of Denmark with a swallow-tail and charged with the monarch's coat of arms set in a white square. The centre square is 32 parts in a flag with the ratio 56:107.\nOther flags in the Kingdom of Denmark.\nGreenland and the Faroe Islands are additional autonomous territories within the Kingdom of Denmark. They have their own official flags.\nSome areas in Denmark have unofficial flags, listed below. The regional flags of Bornholm and \u00c6r\u00f8 are known to be in active use. The flags of Vendsyssel (Vendelbrog) and the Jutlandic flag (\"Den jyske fane\") are obscure. None of these flags have legal recognition in Denmark, and are officially considered to be \"fantasy flags\". Denmark reserves official recognition to official flags and regional flags (\"omr\u00e5deflag\") from other jurisdictions."}
{"id": "8753", "revid": "28331428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8753", "title": "Dharma", "text": "Dharma (; , (Pali : \"dhamma\")) is a key concept with multiple meanings in Indian religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and others. There is no single-word translation for \"dharma\" in Western languages.\nIn Hinduism, dharma is one of the four components of the \"Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha\", the aims of life, and signifies behaviours that are considered to be in accord with \"\u1e5ata\", the order that makes life and universe possible. It includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and \"right way of living\". In Buddhism, dharma means \"cosmic law and order\", as expressed by the teachings of the Buddha. In Buddhist philosophy, \"dhamma/dharma\" is also the term for \"phenomena\". Dharma in Jainism refers to the teachings of \"Tirthankara\" (\"Jina\") and the body of doctrine pertaining to the purification and moral transformation of human beings. For Sikhs, dharma means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice.\nThe concept of dharma was already in use in the historical Vedic religion, and its meaning and conceptual scope has evolved over several millennia. As with other components of the \"Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha\", the concept of dharma is pan-Indian. The ancient Tamil moral text of \"Tirukkural\" is solely based on \"a\u1e5fam\", the Tamil term for dharma. The antonym of dharma is \"adharma\".\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Dharma\" has roots in the Sanskrit \"Dhr-\" which means \"to hold\" or \"to support\". From this, it takes the meaning of \"what is established or firm\", and hence \"law\". It is derived from an older Vedic Sanskrit \"n\"-stem \"dharman-\", with a literal meaning of \"bearer, supporter\", in a religious sense conceived as an aspect of Rta.\nIn the Rigveda, the word appears as an \"n\"-stem, \"\", with a range of meanings encompassing \"something established or firm\" (in the literal sense of prods or poles). Figuratively, it means \"sustainer\" and \"supporter\" (of deities). It is semantically similar to the Greek \"Themis\" (\"fixed decree, statute, law\"). \nIn Classical Sanskrit, and in the Vedic Sanskrit of the Atharvaveda, the stem is thematic: \"\" (Devan\u0101gar\u012b: \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e). In Prakrit and P\u0101li, it is rendered \"dhamma\". In some contemporary Indian languages and dialects it alternatively occurs as \"dharm\".\nWhen the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka wanted in the 3rd century BCE to translate the word \"Dharma\" (he used Prakrit word \"Dha\u1e43ma\") into Greek and Aramaic, he used the Greek word \"Eusebeia\" (\u03b5\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, piety, spiritual maturity, or godliness) in the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription and the Kandahar Greek Edicts, and the Aramaic word \"Qsyt\" (\"Truth\") in the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription.\nDefinition.\nDharma is a concept of central importance in Indian philosophy and religion. It has multiple meanings in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. It is difficult to provide a single concise definition for \"dharma\", as the word has a long and varied history and straddles a complex set of meanings and interpretations. There is no equivalent single-word synonym for \"dharma\" in western languages.\nThere have been numerous, conflicting attempts to translate ancient Sanskrit literature with the word \"dharma\" into German, English and French. The concept, claims Paul Horsch, has caused exceptional difficulties for modern commentators and translators. For example, while Grassmann's translation of Rig-veda identifies seven different meanings of dharma, Karl Friedrich Geldner in his translation of the Rig-veda employs 20 different translations for dharma, including meanings such as \"law\", \"order\", \"duty\", \"custom\", \"quality\", and \"model\", among others. However, the word \"dharma\" has become a widely accepted loanword in English, and is included in all modern unabridged English dictionaries.\nThe root of the word \"dharma\" is \"dhri\", which means \"to support, hold, or bear\". It is the thing that regulates the course of change by not participating in change, but that principle which remains constant. Monier-Williams, the widely cited resource for definitions and explanation of Sanskrit words and concepts of Hinduism, offers numerous definitions of the word \"dharma\", such as that which is established or firm, steadfast decree, statute, law, practice, custom, duty, right, justice, virtue, morality, ethics, religion, religious merit, good works, nature, character, quality, property. Yet, each of these definitions is incomplete, while the combination of these translations does not convey the total sense of the word. In common parlance, \"dharma\" means \"right way of living\" and \"path of rightness\".\nThe meaning of the word \"dharma\" depends on the context, and its meaning has evolved as ideas of Hinduism have developed through history. In the earliest texts and ancient myths of Hinduism, \"dharma\" meant cosmic law, the rules that created the universe from chaos, as well as rituals; in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas and the Epics, the meaning became refined, richer, and more complex, and the word was applied to diverse contexts.\nIn certain contexts, \"dharma\" designates human behaviours considered necessary for order of things in the universe, principles that prevent chaos, behaviours and action necessary to all life in nature, society, family as well as at the individual level. \"Dharma\" encompasses ideas such as duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs and all behaviour considered appropriate, correct or morally upright.\nThe antonym of \"dharma\" is \"adharma\" (Sanskrit: \u0905\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e), meaning that which is \"not dharma\". As with \"dharma\", the word \"adharma\" includes and implies many ideas; in common parlance, adharma means that which is against nature, immoral, unethical, wrong or unlawful.\nIn Buddhism, \"dharma\" incorporates the teachings and doctrines of the founder of Buddhism, the Buddha.\nHistory.\nAccording to Pandurang Vaman Kane, author of the authoritative book \"History of Dharmasastra\", the word \"dharma\" appears at least fifty-six times in the hymns of the Rigveda, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch, the word \"dharma\" has its origin in the myths of Vedic Hinduism. The hymns of the Rig Veda claim Brahman created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains. The gods, mainly Indra, then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability \u2013 actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma. In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a cosmic principle and appears in verses independent of gods. It evolves into a concept, claims Paul Horsch, that has a dynamic functional sense in Atharvaveda for example, where it becomes the cosmic law that links cause and effect through a subject. Dharma, in these ancient texts, also takes a ritual meaning. The ritual is connected to the cosmic, and \"dharmani\" is equated to ceremonial devotion to the principles that gods used to create order from disorder, the world from chaos. Past the ritual and cosmic sense of dharma that link the current world to mythical universe, the concept extends to ethical-social sense that links human beings to each other and to other life forms. It is here that dharma as a concept of law emerges in Hinduism.\nDharma and related words are found in the oldest Vedic literature of Hinduism, in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the Epics; the word dharma also plays a central role in the literature of other Indian religions founded later, such as Buddhism and Jainism. According to Brereton, \"Dharman\" occurs 63 times in Rig-veda; in addition, words related to Dharman also appear in Rig-veda, for example once as dharmakrt, 6 times as \"satyadharman\", and once as \"dharmavant\", 4 times as \"dharman\" and twice as \"dhariman\".\nIndo-European parallels for \"Dharma\" are known, but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian \"darm\u0101n\" \"remedy\", the meaning of which is rather removed from Indo-Aryan \"dh\u00e1rman\", suggesting that the word \"Dharma\" did not have a major role in the Indo-Iranian period, and was principally developed more recently under the Vedic tradition. However, it is thought that the \"Daena\" of Zoroastrianism, also meaning the \"eternal Law\" or \"religion\", is related to Sanskrit \"Dharma\". Ideas in parts overlapping to \"Dharma\" are found in other ancient cultures: such as Chinese Tao, Egyptian Maat, Sumerian Me.\nEusebeia and dharma.\nIn the mid-20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered in Afghanistan, the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription. This rock inscription contains Greek and Aramaic text. According to , on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia. Scholars of Hellenistic Greece explain eusebeia as a complex concept. Eusebia means not only to venerate gods, but also spiritual maturity, a reverential attitude toward life, and includes the right conduct toward one's parents, siblings and children, the right conduct between husband and wife, and the conduct between biologically unrelated people. This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker, suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of right, of good, of one's duty toward the human community.\nRta, maya and dharma.\nThe evolving literature of Hinduism linked \"dharma\" to two other important concepts: \"\u1e5ata\" and \"M\u0101y\u0101\". \u1e5ata in Vedas is the truth and cosmic principle which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. M\u0101y\u0101 in Rig-veda and later literature means illusion, fraud, deception, magic that misleads and creates disorder, thus is contrary to reality, laws and rules that establish order, predictability and harmony. Paul Horsch suggests \u1e5ata and dharma are parallel concepts, the former being a cosmic principle, the latter being of moral social sphere; while M\u0101y\u0101 and dharma are also correlative concepts, the former being that which corrupts law and moral life, the later being that which strengthens law and moral life.\nDay proposes dharma is a manifestation of \u1e5ata, but suggests \u1e5ata may have been subsumed into a more complex concept of dharma, as the idea developed in ancient India over time in a nonlinear manner. The following verse from the Rigveda is an example where \"rta\" and dharma are linked:\nHinduism.\nDharma is an organising principle in Hinduism that applies to human beings in solitude, in their interaction with human beings and nature, as well as between inanimate objects, to all of cosmos and its parts. It refers to the order and customs which make life and universe possible, and includes behaviours, rituals, rules that govern society, and ethics. Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviours that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous. Dharma, according to Van Buitenen, is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is neither the act nor the result, but the natural laws that guide the act and create the result to prevent chaos in the world. It is innate characteristic, that makes the being what it is. It is, claims Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert. In Hinduism, it is the dharma of the bee to make honey, of cow to give milk, of sun to radiate sunshine, of river to flow. In terms of humanity, dharma is the need for, the effect of and essence of service and interconnectedness of all life.\nIn its true essence, dharma means for a Hindu to \"expand the mind\". Furthermore, it represents the direct connection between the individual and the societal phenomena that bind the society together. In the way societal phenomena affect the conscience of the individual, similarly may the actions of an individual alter the course of the society, for better or for worse. This is been subtly echoed by the credo \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u094b \u0927\u093e\u0930\u092f\u0924\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u093e: meaning dharma is that which holds and provides support to the social construct.\nIn Hinduism, \"dharma\" includes two aspects \u2013 \"san\u0101tana dharma\", which is the overall, unchanging and abiding principals of dharma which are not subject to change, and \"yuga dharma\", which is valid for a yuga, an epoch or age as established by Hindu tradition and thus may change at the conclusion of its time.\nIn Vedas and Upanishads.\nThe history section of this article discusses the development of dharma concept in Vedas. This development continued in the Upanishads and later ancient scripts of Hinduism. In Upanishads, the concept of dharma continues as universal principle of law, order, harmony, and truth. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to \"satya\" (Sanskrit: \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0902, truth), in hymn 1.4.14 of Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as follows:\nIn the Epics.\nThe Hindu religion and philosophy, claims Daniel Ingalls, places major emphasis on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.\nIn the Second Book of Ramayana, for example, a peasant asks the King to do what dharma morally requires of him, the King agrees and does so even though his compliance with the law of dharma costs him dearly. Similarly, dharma is at the centre of all major events in the life of Rama, Sita, and Lakshman in Ramayana, claims Daniel Ingalls. Each episode of Ramayana presents life situations and ethical questions in symbolic terms. The issue is debated by the characters, finally the right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. For this reason, in Hindu Epics, the good, morally upright, law-abiding king is referred to as \"dharmaraja\".\nIn Mahabharata, the other major Indian epic, similarly, dharma is central, and it is presented with symbolism and metaphors. Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudhishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by dharma. The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingalls, because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingalls: one answer is of Bhima, which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of Yudhishthira, which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective Arjuna, which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of dharma. There is extensive discussion of dharma at the individual level in the Epics of Hinduism, observes Ingalls; for example, on free will versus destiny, when and why human beings believe in either, ultimately concluding that the strong and prosperous naturally uphold free will, while those facing grief or frustration naturally lean towards destiny. The Epics of Hinduism illustrate various aspects of dharma, they are a means of communicating dharma with metaphors.\nAccording to 4th century Vatsyayana.\nAccording to Klaus Klostermaier, 4th century Hindu scholar V\u0101tsy\u0101yana explained dharma by contrasting it with adharma. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana suggested that dharma is not merely in one's actions, but also in words one speaks or writes, and in thought. According to V\u0101tsy\u0101yana:\nAccording to Patanjali Yoga.\nIn the \"Yoga Sutras\" of Patanjali the dharma is real; in the Vedanta it is unreal.\nDharma is part of yoga, suggests Patanjali; the elements of Hindu dharma are the attributes, qualities and aspects of yoga. Patanjali explained dharma in two categories: \"yamas\" (restraints) and \"niyamas\" (observances).\nThe five yamas, according to Patanjali, are: abstain from injury to all living creatures, abstain from falsehood (satya), abstain from unauthorised appropriation of things-of-value from another (acastrapurvaka), abstain from coveting or sexually cheating on your partner, and abstain from expecting or accepting gifts from others. The five yama apply in action, speech and mind. In explaining yama, Patanjali clarifies that certain professions and situations may require qualification in conduct. For example, a fisherman must injure a fish, but he must attempt to do this with least trauma to fish and the fisherman must try to injure no other creature as he fishes.\nThe five niyamas (observances) are cleanliness by eating pure food and removing impure thoughts (such as arrogance or jealousy or pride), contentment in one's means, meditation and silent reflection regardless of circumstances one faces, study and pursuit of historic knowledge, and devotion of all actions to the Supreme Teacher to achieve perfection of concentration.\nSources.\nDharma is an empirical and experiential inquiry for every man and woman, according to some texts of Hinduism. For example, Apastamba Dharmasutra states:\nIn other texts, three sources and means to discover dharma in Hinduism are described. These, according to , are: First, learning historical knowledge such as Vedas, Upanishads, the Epics and other Sanskrit literature with the help of one's teacher. Second, observing the behaviour and example of good people. The third source applies when neither one's education nor example exemplary conduct is known. In this case, \"atmatusti\" is the source of dharma in Hinduism, that is the good person reflects and follows what satisfies his heart, his own inner feeling, what he feels driven to.\nDharma, life stages and social stratification.\nSome texts of Hinduism outline \"dharma\" for society and at the individual level. Of these, the most cited one is \"Manusmriti\", which describes the four \"Varnas\", their rights and duties. Most texts of Hinduism, however, discuss \"dharma\" with no mention of \"Varna\" (caste). Other dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas. Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. Bhrigu, in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that dharma does not require any varnas. In practice, medieval India is widely believed to be a socially stratified society, with each social strata inheriting a profession and being endogamous. Varna was not absolute in Hindu dharma; individuals had the right to renounce and leave their Varna, as well as their asramas of life, in search of moksa. While neither Manusmriti nor succeeding Smritis of Hinduism ever use the word varnadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas), or varnasramadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas and asramas), the scholarly commentary on Manusmriti use these words, and thus associate dharma with varna system of India. In 6th century India, even Buddhist kings called themselves \"protectors of varnasramadharma\" \u2013 that is, dharma of varna and asramas of life.\nAt the individual level, some texts of Hinduism outline four \u0101\u015bramas, or stages of life as individual's dharma. These are: (1) brahmac\u0101rya, the life of preparation as a student, (2) g\u1e5bhastha, the life of the householder with family and other social roles, (3) v\u0101nprastha or aranyaka, the life of the forest-dweller, transitioning from worldly occupations to reflection and renunciation, and (4) sanny\u0101sa, the life of giving away all property, becoming a recluse and devotion to moksa, spiritual matters.\nThe four stages of life complete the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism. Dharma enables the individual to satisfy the striving for stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving to do the right thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are Artha \u2013 the striving for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, and so forth; Kama \u2013 the striving for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfilment, and so forth; and Moksa \u2013 the striving for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, and so forth. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu dharma.\nDharma and poverty.\nDharma being necessary for individual and society, is dependent on poverty and prosperity in a society, according to Hindu dharma scriptures. For example, according to Adam Bowles, Shatapatha Brahmana 11.1.6.24 links social prosperity and \"dharma\" through water. Waters come from rains, it claims; when rains are abundant there is prosperity on the earth, and this prosperity enables people to follow Dharma \u2013 moral and lawful life. In times of distress, of drought, of poverty, everything suffers including relations between human beings and the human ability to live according to dharma.\nIn Rajadharmaparvan 91.34-8, the relationship between poverty and dharma reaches a full circle. A land with less moral and lawful life suffers distress, and as distress rises it causes more immoral and unlawful life, which further increases distress. Those in power must follow the raja dharma (that is, dharma of rulers), because this enables the society and the individual to follow dharma and achieve prosperity.\nDharma and law.\nThe notion of \"dharma\" as duty or propriety is found in India's ancient legal and religious texts. Common examples of such use are Pitri Dharma (meaning a person's duty as a father), Putra Dharma (a person's duty as a son), Raj Dharma (a person's duty as a king) and so forth. In Hindu philosophy, justice, social harmony, and happiness requires that people live per dharma. The Dharmashastra is a record of these guidelines and rules. The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras. Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars. These different and conflicting law books are neither exclusive, nor do they supersede other sources of dharma in Hinduism. These Dharmasutras include instructions on education of the young, their rites of passage, customs, religious rites and rituals, marital rights and obligations, death and ancestral rites, laws and administration of justice, crimes, punishments, rules and types of evidence, duties of a king, as well as morality.\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhism \"dharma\" means cosmic law and order, but is also applied to the teachings of the Buddha. In Buddhist philosophy, \"dhamma/dharma\" is also the term for \"phenomena\".\nBuddha's teachings.\nFor practising Buddhists, references to \"dharma\" (\"dhamma\" in Pali) particularly as \"the Dharma\", generally means the teachings of the Buddha, commonly known throughout the East as Buddha-Dharma. It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path), as opposed to the parables and to the poems.\nThe status of Dharma is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lie beyond the \"three realms\" (Sanskrit: \"tridhatu\") and the \"wheel of becoming\" (Sanskrit: \"bhavachakra\"), somewhat like the pagan Greek and Christian logos: this is known as \"Dharmakaya\" (Sanskrit). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the essence of the \"84,000 different aspects of the teaching\" (Tibetan: \"chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong\") that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.\nDharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various schools of Buddhism have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the \"truth\", or the ultimate reality of \"the way that things really are\" (Tibetan: \"Ch\u00f6\").\nThe Dharma is one of the Three Jewels of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the Buddha, meaning the mind's perfection of enlightenment, the Dharma, meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the Sangha, meaning the monastic community who provide guidance and support to followers of the Buddha.\nChan Buddhism.\nDharma is employed in Ch'an in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognised in Dharma transmission.\nTheravada Buddhism.\nIn Theravada Buddhism obtaining ultimate realisation of the dhamma is achieved in three phases; learning, practising and realising.\nIn Pali \nJainism.\nThe word Dharma in Jainism is found in all its key texts. It has a contextual meaning and refers to a number of ideas. In the broadest sense, it means the teachings of the Jinas, or teachings of any competing spiritual school, a supreme path, socio-religious duty, and that which is the highest \"mangala\" (holy).\nThe major Jain text, \"Tattvartha Sutra\" mentions \"Das-dharma\" with the meaning of \"ten righteous virtues\". These are forbearance, modesty, straightforwardness, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation, non-attachment, and celibacy. Ac\u0101rya Am\u1e5btacandra, author of the Jain text, \"Puru\u1e63\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya\" writes:\nDharmastikaay (Dravya).\nThe term \"dharmastikaay\" also has a specific ontological and soteriological meaning in Jainism, as a part of its theory of six dravya (substance or a reality). In the Jain tradition, existence consists of \"jiva\" (soul, atman) and \"ajiva\" (non-soul), the latter consisting of five categories: inert non-sentient atomic matter (pudgalastikaay), space (akasha), time (kala), principle of motion (dharmastikaay), and principle of rest (adharmastikaay). The use of the term \"dharmastikaay\" to mean motion and to refer to an ontological sub-category is peculiar to Jainism, and not found in the metaphysics of Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism.\nSikhism.\nFor Sikhs, the word \"dharam\" () means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice. Guru Granth Sahib in hymn 1353 connotes dharma as duty. The 3HO movement in Western culture, which has incorporated certain Sikh beliefs, defines Sikh Dharma broadly as all that constitutes religion, moral duty and way of life.\nDharma in symbols.\nThe importance of \"dharma\" to Indian sentiments is illustrated by India's decision in 1947 to include the Ashoka Chakra, a depiction of the \"dharmachakra\" (the \"wheel of dharma\"), as the central motif on its flag."}

Fletcher Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University. Dennett is an atheist and secularist, a member of the Secular Coalition for America advisory board, and a member of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, as well as an outspoken supporter of the Brights movement. Dennett is referred to as one of the \"Four Horsemen of New Atheism\", along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and the late Christopher Hitchens.\nDennett is a member of the editorial board for \"The Rutherford Journal\".\nEarly life, education, and career.\nDennett was born on March 28, 1942, in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Ruth Marjorie (n\u00e9e Leck) and Daniel Clement Dennett Jr. Dennett spent part of his childhood in Lebanon, where, during World War II, his father was a covert counter-intelligence agent with the Office of Strategic Services posing as a cultural attach\u00e9 to the American Embassy in Beirut. When he was five, his mother took him back to Massachusetts after his father died in an unexplained plane crash. Dennett's sister is the investigative journalist Charlotte Dennett. Dennett says that he was first introduced to the notion of philosophy while attending summer camp at age 11, when a camp counselor said to him, \"You know what you are, Daniel? You're a philosopher.\"\nDennett graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1959, and spent one year at Wesleyan University before receiving his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy at Harvard University in 1963. At Harvard University he was a student of W.\u00a0V. Quine. In 1965, he received his Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy at the University of Oxford, where he studied under Gilbert Ryle and was a member of Hertford College. His dissertation was entitled \"The Mind and the Brain: Introspective Description in the Light of Neurological Findings; Intentionality\".\nDennett describes himself as \"an autodidact\u2014or, more properly, the beneficiary of hundreds of hours of informal tutorials on all the fields that interest me, from some of the world's leading scientists\".\nHe is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and a Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. He was named 2004 Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association. In 2006, Dennett received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.\nIn February 2010, he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.\nIn 2012, he was awarded the Erasmus Prize, an annual award for a person who has made an exceptional contribution to European culture, society or social science, \"for his ability to translate the cultural significance of science and technology to a broad audience.\"\nIn 2018, he was awarded an honorary degree by Radboud University, located in Nijmegen, Netherlands, for his contributions to and influence on cross-disciplinary science.\nPhilosophical views.\nFree will.\nWhile he is a confirmed compatibilist on free will, in \"On Giving Libertarians What They Say They Want\"\u2014chapter 15 of his 1978 book \"Brainstorms\"\u2014Dennett articulated the case for a two-stage model of decision making in contrast to libertarian views.\nWhile other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including William James, Henri Poincar\u00e9, Arthur Compton, and Henry Margenau, Dennett defends this model for the following reasons:\nLeading libertarian philosophers such as Robert Kane have rejected Dennett's model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent's motives and reasons, character and values, and feelings and desires. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:\nPhilosophy of mind.\nDennett has remarked in several places (such as \"Self-portrait\", in \"Brainchildren\") that his overall philosophical project has remained largely the same since his time at Oxford. He is primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in empirical research. In his original dissertation, \"Content and Consciousness\", he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project has also stayed true to this distinction. Just as \"Content and Consciousness\" has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided \"Brainstorms\" into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in \"The Intentional Stance\" and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in \"Consciousness Explained\". These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.\nIn chapter 5 of \"Consciousness Explained\" Dennett describes his multiple drafts model of consciousness. He states that, \"all varieties of perception\u2014indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity\u2014are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous 'editorial revision.'\" (p.\u00a0111). Later he asserts, \"These yield, over the course of time, something \"rather like\" a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ...\" (p.\u00a0135, emphasis in the original).\nIn this work, Dennett's interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since become an integral part of his program. He defends a theory known by some as Neural Darwinism. He also presents an argument against qualia; he argues that the concept is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of physicalism. His strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.\nDennett self-identifies with a few terms:\nIn \"Consciousness Explained\", he affirms \"I am a sort of 'teleofunctionalist', of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist\". He goes on to say, \"I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of verificationist\".(page 460-461)\nEvolutionary debate.\nMuch of Dennett's work since the 1990s has been concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (\"Kinds of Minds\"), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (\"Freedom Evolves\").\nDennett sees evolution by natural selection as an algorithmic process (though he spells out that algorithms as simple as long division often incorporate a significant degree of randomness). This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, who preferred to stress the \"pluralism\" of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).\nDennett's views on evolution are identified as being strongly adaptationist, in line with his theory of the intentional stance, and the evolutionary views of biologist Richard Dawkins. In \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould. This stems from Gould's long-running public debate with E.\u00a0O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists over human sociobiology and its descendant evolutionary psychology, which Gould and Richard Lewontin opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and Steven Pinker. Gould argued that Dennett overstated his claims and misrepresented Gould's, to reinforce what Gould describes as Dennett's \"Darwinian fundamentalism\".\nDennett's theories have had a significant influence on the work of evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller.\nAn account of religion and morality.\nIn \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", Dennett writes that evolution can account for the origin of morality. He rejects, however, the idea that morality being natural to us implies that we should take a skeptical position regarding ethics, noting that what is fallacious in the naturalistic fallacy is not to support values per se, but rather to \"rush\" from facts to values.\nIn his 2006 book, \"\", Dennett attempts to account for religious belief naturalistically, explaining possible evolutionary reasons for the phenomenon of religious adherence.\nIn this book he declares himself to be \"a bright\", and defends the term.\nHe has been doing research into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found what he called a \"don't ask, don't tell\" conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but they did not want to lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual. The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics. The research and stories Dennett and LaScola accumulated during this project were published in their 2013 co-authored book, \"Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind\".\nOther philosophical views.\nHe has also written about and advocated the notion of memetics as a philosophically useful tool, most recently in his \"Brains, Computers, and Minds\", a three-part presentation through Harvard's MBB 2009 Distinguished Lecture Series.\nDennett has been critical of postmodernism, having said: Postmodernism, the school of \"thought\" that proclaimed \"There are no truths, only interpretations\" has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for \"conversations\" in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster.\nDennett adopted and somewhat redefined the term \"deepity\", originally coined by Miriam Weizenbaum. Dennett used \"deepity\" for a statement that is apparently profound, but is actually trivial on one level and meaningless on another. Generally, a deepity has two (or more) meanings: one that is true but trivial, and another that sounds profound and would be important if true, but is actually false or meaningless. Examples are \"Que sera sera!\", \"Beauty is only skin deep!\", \"The power of intention can transform your life.\" The term many times.\nArtificial intelligence.\nWhile approving of the increase in efficiency that humans reap by using resources such as expert systems in medicine or GPS in navigation, Dennett sees a danger in machines performing an ever-increasing proportion of basic tasks in perception, memory, and algorithmic computation because people may tend to anthropomorphize such systems and attribute intellectual powers to them that they do not possess. He believes the relevant danger from artificial intelligence (AI) is that people will misunderstand the nature of basically \"parasitic\" AI systems, rather than employing them constructively to challenge and develop the human user's powers of comprehension.\nAs given in his most recent book, \"From Bacteria to Bach and Back\", Dennett's views are contrary to those of Nick Bostrom. Although acknowledging that it is \"possible in principle\" to create AI with human-like comprehension and agency, Dennett maintains that the difficulties of any such \"strong AI\" project would be orders of magnitude greater than those raising concerns have realized. According to Dennett, the prospect of superintelligence (AI massively exceeding the cognitive performance of humans in all domains) is at least 50 years away, and of far less pressing significance than other problems the world faces.\nPersonal life.\nDennett married Susan Bell in 1962. They live in North Andover, Massachusetts, and have a daughter, a son, and five grandchildren.\nDennett is an avid sailor."}
{"id": "8757", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8757", "title": "Darwin's Dangerous Idea", "text": "Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life is a 1995 book by the philosopher Daniel Dennett, in which the author looks at some of the repercussions of Darwinian theory. The crux of the argument is that, whether or not Darwin's theories are overturned, there is no going back from the dangerous idea that design (purpose or what something is for) might not need a designer. Dennett makes this case on the basis that natural selection is a blind process, which is nevertheless sufficiently powerful to explain the evolution of life. Darwin's discovery was that the generation of life worked algorithmically, that processes behind it work in such a way that given these processes the results that they tend toward must be so.\nDennett says, for example, that by claiming that minds cannot be reduced to purely algorithmic processes, many of his eminent contemporaries are claiming that miracles can occur. These assertions have generated a great deal of debate and discussion in the general public. The book was a finalist for the 1995 National Book Award in non-fiction and the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction.\nBackground.\nDennett's previous book was \"Consciousness Explained\" (1991). Dennett noted discomfort with Darwinism among not only lay people but also even academics and decided it was time to write a book dealing with the subject. \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\" is not meant to be a work of science, but rather an interdisciplinary book; Dennett admits that he does not understand all of the scientific details himself. He goes into a moderate level of detail, but leaves it for the reader to go into greater depth if desired, providing references to this end.\nIn writing the book, Dennett wanted to \"get thinkers in other disciplines to take evolutionary theory seriously, to show them how they have been underestimating it, and to show them why they have been listening to the wrong sirens\". To do this he tells a story; one that is mainly original but includes some material from his previous work.\nDennett taught an undergraduate seminar at Tufts University on Darwin and philosophy, which included most of the ideas in the book. He also had the help of fellow staff and other academics, some of whom read drafts of the book. It is dedicated to W. V. O. Quine, \"teacher and friend\".\nSynopsis.\nPart I: Starting in the Middle.\n\"Starting in the Middle\", Part I of \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", gets its name from a quote by Willard Van Orman Quine: \"Analyze theory-building how we will, we all must start in the middle. Our conceptual firsts are middle-sized, middle-distance objects, and our introduction to them and to everything comes midway in the cultural evolution of the race.\"\nThe first chapter \"Tell Me Why\" is named after a song.\nBefore Charles Darwin, and still today, a majority of people see God as the ultimate cause of all design, or the ultimate answer to 'why?' questions. John Locke argued for the primacy of mind before matter, and David Hume, while exposing problems with Locke's view, could not see any alternative.\nDarwin provided just such an alternative: evolution. Besides providing evidence of common descent, he introduced a mechanism to explain it: natural selection. According to Dennett, natural selection is a mindless, mechanical and algorithmic process\u2014Darwin's dangerous idea. The third chapter introduces the concept of \"skyhooks\" and \"cranes\" (see below). He suggests that resistance to Darwinism is based on a desire for skyhooks, which do not really exist. According to Dennett, good reductionists explain apparent design without skyhooks; greedy reductionists try to explain it without cranes.\nChapter 4 looks at the tree of life, such as how it can be visualized and some crucial events in life's history. The next chapter concerns the possible and the actual, using the 'Library of Mendel' (the space of all logically possible genomes) as a conceptual aid.\nIn the last chapter of part I, Dennett treats human artifacts and culture as a branch of a unified Design Space. Descent or homology can be detected by shared design features that would be unlikely to appear independently. However, there are also \"Forced Moves\" or \"Good Tricks\" that will be discovered repeatedly, either by natural selection (see convergent evolution) or human investigation.\nPart II: Darwinian Thinking in Biology.\nThe first chapter of part II, \"Darwinian Thinking in Biology\", asserts that life originated without any skyhooks, and the orderly world we know is the result of a blind and undirected shuffle through chaos.\nThe eighth chapter's message is conveyed by its title, \"Biology is Engineering\"; biology is the study of design, function, construction and operation. However, there are some important differences between biology and engineering. Related to the engineering concept of optimization, the next chapter deals with adaptationism, which Dennett endorses, calling Gould and Lewontin's \"refutation\" of it an illusion. Dennett thinks adaptationism is, in fact, the best way of uncovering constraints.\nThe tenth chapter, entitled \"Bully for Brontosaurus\", is an extended critique of Stephen Jay Gould, who Dennett feels has created a distorted view of evolution with his popular writings; his \"self-styled revolutions\" against adaptationism, gradualism and other orthodox Darwinism all being false alarms. The final chapter of part II dismisses directed mutation, the inheritance of acquired traits and Teilhard's \"Omega Point\", and insists that other controversies and hypotheses (like the unit of selection and Panspermia) have no dire consequences for orthodox Darwinism.\nPart III: Mind, Meaning, Mathematics and Morality.\n\"Mind, Meaning, Mathematics and Morality\" is the name of Part III, which begins with a quote from Nietzsche. Chapter 12, \"The Cranes of Culture\", discusses cultural evolution. It asserts that the meme has a role to play in our understanding of culture, and that it allows humans, alone among animals, to \"transcend\" our selfish genes. \"Losing Our Minds to Darwin\" follows, a chapter about the evolution of brains, minds and language. Dennett criticizes Noam Chomsky's perceived resistance to the evolution of language, its modeling by artificial intelligence, and reverse engineering.\nThe evolution of meaning is then discussed, and Dennett uses a series of thought experiments to persuade the reader that meaning is the product of meaningless, algorithmic processes.\nChapter 15 asserts that G\u00f6del's Theorem does not make certain sorts of artificial intelligence impossible. Dennett extends his criticism to Roger Penrose. The subject then moves on to the origin and evolution of morality, beginning with Thomas Hobbes (who Dennett calls \"the first sociobiologist\") and Friedrich Nietzsche. He concludes that only an evolutionary analysis of ethics makes sense, though he cautions against some varieties of 'greedy ethical reductionism'. Before moving to the next chapter, he discusses some sociobiology controversies.\nThe penultimate chapter, entitled \"Redesigning Morality\", begins by asking if ethics can be 'naturalized'. Dennett does not believe there is much hope of discovering an algorithm for doing the right thing, but expresses optimism in our ability to design and redesign our approach to moral problems. In \"The Future of an Idea\", the book's last chapter, Dennett praises biodiversity, including cultural diversity. In closing, he uses \"Beauty and the Beast\" as an analogy; although Darwin's idea may seem dangerous, it is actually quite beautiful.\nCentral concepts.\nDesign Space.\nDennett believes there is little or no principled difference between the naturally generated products of evolution and the man-made artifacts of human creativity and culture. For this reason he indicates deliberately that the complex fruits of the tree of life are in a very meaningful sense \"designed\"\u2014even though he does not believe evolution was guided by a higher intelligence.\nDennett supports using the notion of memes to better understand cultural evolution. He also believes even human creativity might operate by the Darwinian mechanism. This leads him to propose that the \"space\" describing biological \"design\" is connected with the space describing human culture and technology.\nA precise mathematical definition of Design Space is not given in \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\". Dennett acknowledges this and admits he is offering a philosophical idea rather than a scientific formulation.\nNatural selection as an algorithm.\nDennett describes natural selection as a substrate-neutral, mindless algorithm for moving through Design Space.\nUniversal acid.\nDennett writes about the fantasy of a \"universal acid\" as a liquid that is so corrosive that it would eat through anything that it came into contact with, even a potential container. Such a powerful substance would transform everything it was applied to; leaving something very different in its wake. This is where Dennett draws parallels from the \u201cuniversal acid\u201d to Darwin's idea: \n\u201cit eats through just about every traditional concept, and leaves in its wake a revolutionized world-view, with most of the old landmarks still recognizable, but transformed in fundamental ways.\u201d\nWhile there are people who would like to see Darwin's idea contained within the field of biology, Dennett asserts that this dangerous idea inevitably \u201cleaks\u201d out to transform other fields as well.\nSkyhooks and cranes.\nDennett uses the term \"skyhook\" to describe a source of design complexity that does not build on lower, simpler layers\u2014in simple terms, a miracle.\nIn philosophical arguments concerning the reducibility (or otherwise) of the human mind, Dennett's concept pokes fun at the idea of intelligent design emanating from on high, either originating from one or more gods, or providing its own grounds in an absurd, Munchausen-like bootstrapping manner.\nDennett also accuses various competing neo-Darwinian ideas of making use of such supposedly unscientific skyhooks in explaining evolution, coming down particularly hard on the ideas of Stephen Jay Gould.\nDennett contrasts theories of complexity that require such miracles with those based on \"cranes\", structures that permit the construction of entities of greater complexity but are themselves founded solidly \"on the ground\" of physical science.\nReception.\nIn \"The New York Review of Books\", John Maynard Smith praised \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\":\nIt is therefore a pleasure to meet a philosopher who understands what Darwinism is about, and approves of it.\nDennett goes well beyond biology. He sees Darwinism as a corrosive acid, capable of dissolving our earlier belief and forcing a reconsideration of much of sociology and philosophy. Although modestly written, this is not a modest book. Dennett argues that, if we understand \"Darwin's dangerous idea\", we are forced to reject or modify much of our current intellectual baggage...\nWriting in the same publication, Stephen Jay Gould criticised \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\" for being an \"influential but misguided ultra-Darwinian manifesto\":\nDaniel Dennett devotes the longest chapter in \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\" to an excoriating caricature of my ideas, all in order to bolster his defense of Darwinian fundamentalism. If an argued case can be discerned at all amid the slurs and sneers, it would have to be described as an effort to claim that I have, thanks to some literary skill, tried to raise a few piddling, insignificant, and basically conventional ideas to \"revolutionary\" status, challenging what he takes to be the true Darwinian scripture. Since Dennett shows so little understanding of evolutionary theory beyond natural selection, his critique of my work amounts to little more than sniping at false targets of his own construction. He never deals with my ideas as such, but proceeds by hint, innuendo, false attribution, and error.\nGould was also a harsh critic of Dennett's idea of the \"universal acid\" of natural selection and of his subscription to the idea of memetics; Dennett responded, and the exchange between Dennett, Gould, and Robert Wright was printed in the \"New York Review of Books\".\nBiologist H. Allen Orr wrote a critical review emphasizing similar points in the \"Boston Review\".\nThe book has also provoked a negative reaction from creationists; Frederick Crews writes that \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\" \"rivals Richard Dawkins's \"The Blind Watchmaker\" as the creationists' most cordially hated text.\""}
{"id": "8758", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8758", "title": "Douglas Hofstadter", "text": "Douglas Richard Hofstadter (born February 15, 1945) is an American scholar of cognitive science, physics, and comparative literature whose research includes concepts such as the sense of self in relation to the external world, consciousness, analogy-making, artistic creation, literary translation, and discovery in mathematics and physics. His 1979 book \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid\" won both the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction and a National Book Award (at that time called The American Book Award) for Science. His 2007 book \"I Am a Strange Loop\" won the \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Prize for Science and Technology.\nEarly life and education.\nHofstadter was born in New York City to Jewish parents: Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert Hofstadter and Nancy Givan Hofstadter. He grew up on the campus of Stanford University, where his father was a professor, and attended the International School of Geneva in 1958\u201359. He graduated with Distinction in mathematics from Stanford University in 1965, and received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Oregon in 1975, where his study of the energy levels of Bloch electrons in a magnetic field led to his discovery of the fractal known as Hofstadter's butterfly.\nAcademic career.\nSince 1988, Hofstadter has been the College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Comparative Literature at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he directs the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition which consists of himself and his graduate students, forming the \"Fluid Analogies Research Group\" (FARG). He was initially appointed to the Indiana University's Computer Science Department faculty in 1977, and at that time he launched his research program in computer modeling of mental processes (which he called \"artificial intelligence research\", a label he has since dropped in favor of \"cognitive science research\"). In 1984, he moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he was hired as a professor of psychology and was also appointed to the Walgreen Chair for the Study of Human Understanding. In 1988 he returned to Bloomington as \"College of Arts and Sciences Professor\" in both cognitive science and computer science. He was also appointed adjunct professor of history and philosophy of science, philosophy, comparative literature, and psychology, but has said that his involvement with most of those departments is nominal. In 1988 Hofstadter received the \"In Praise of Reason\" award, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's highest honor. In April 2009 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 2010 he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden.\nHofstadter's many interests include music, visual art, the mind, creativity, consciousness, self-reference, translation and mathematics.\nAt the University of Michigan and Indiana University, he and Melanie Mitchell coauthored a computational model of \"high-level perception\"\u2014Copycat\u2014and several other models of analogy-making and cognition, including the Tabletop project, co-developed with Robert M. French. Hofstadter's doctoral student James Marshall subsequently extended the Copycat project under the name \"Metacat\". The Letter Spirit project, implemented by Gary McGraw and John Rehling, aims to model artistic creativity by designing stylistically uniform \"gridfonts\" (typefaces limited to a grid). Other more recent models include Phaeaco (implemented by Harry Foundalis) and SeqSee (Abhijit Mahabal), which model high-level perception and analogy-making in the microdomains of Bongard problems and number sequences, respectively, as well as George (Francisco Lara-Dammer), which models the processes of perception and discovery in triangle geometry.\nThe pursuit of beauty has driven Hofstadter both inside and outside his professional work. He seeks beautiful mathematical patterns, beautiful explanations, beautiful typefaces, beautiful sonic patterns in poetry, \"etc.\" Hofstadter has said of himself, \"I'm someone who has one foot in the world of humanities and arts, and the other foot in the world of science.\" He has had several exhibitions of his artwork in various university galleries. These shows have featured large collections of his gridfonts, his ambigrams (pieces of calligraphy created with two readings, either of which is usually obtained from the other by rotating or reflecting the ambigram, but sometimes simply by \"oscillation\", like the Necker Cube or the rabbit/duck figure of Joseph Jastrow), and his \"Whirly Art\" (music-inspired visual patterns realized using shapes based on various alphabets from India). Hofstadter invented the term \"ambigram\" in 1984; many ambigrammists have since taken up the concept.\nHofstadter collects and studies cognitive errors (largely, but not solely, speech errors), \"bon mots\" (spontaneous humorous quips), and analogies of all sorts, and his longtime observation of these diverse products of cognition, and his theories about the mechanisms that underlie them, have exerted a powerful influence on the architectures of the computational models he and FARG members have developed.\nAll FARG computational models share certain key principles, including:\nFARG models also have an overarching philosophy that all cognition is built from the making of analogies. The computational architectures that share these precepts are called \"active symbols\" architectures.\nHofstadter's thesis about consciousness, first expressed in \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" (\"GEB\") but also present in several of his later books, is that it is an emergent consequence of seething lower-level activity in the brain. In \"GEB\" he draws an analogy between the social organization of a colony of ants and the mind seen as a coherent \"colony\" of neurons. In particular, Hofstadter claims that our sense of having (or being) an \"I\" comes from the abstract pattern he terms a \"strange loop\", an abstract cousin of such concrete phenomena as audio and video feedback that Hofstadter has defined as \"a level-crossing feedback loop\". The prototypical example of a strange loop is the self-referential structure at the core of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems. Hofstadter's 2007 book \"I Am a Strange Loop\" carries his vision of consciousness considerably further, including the idea that each human \"I\" is distributed over numerous brains, rather than being limited to one.\nHofstadter's writing is characterized by an intense interaction between form and content, as exemplified by the 20 dialogues in \"GEB\", many of which simultaneously discuss and imitate strict musical forms used by Bach, such as canons and fugues. Most of Hofstadter's books feature some kind of structural alternation: in \"GEB\" between dialogues and chapters, in \"The Mind's I\" between selections and reflections, in \"Metamagical Themas\" between Chapters and Postscripts, and so forth. In both his writing and his teaching, Hofstadter stresses the concrete, constantly using examples and analogies, and avoids the abstract. Typical of the courses he teaches is his seminar \"Group Theory and Galois Theory Visualized\", in which abstract mathematical ideas are rendered as concretely as possible. He puts great effort into making ideas clear and visual, and asserts that when he teaches, if his students do not understand something, it is never their fault but always his own.\nHofstadter is passionate about languages. In addition to English, his mother tongue, he speaks French and Italian fluently (the language spoken at home with his children is Italian). At various times in his life, he has studied (in descending order of level of fluency reached) German, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Mandarin, Dutch, Polish, and Hindi. His love of sounds pushes him to strive to minimize, and ideally get rid of, any foreign accent.\n\"Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language\" is a long book devoted to language and translation, especially poetry translation, and one of its leitmotifs is a set of 88 translations of \"Ma Mignonne\", a highly constrained poem by 16th-century French poet Cl\u00e9ment Marot. In this book, Hofstadter jokingly describes himself as \"pilingual\" (meaning that the sum total of the varying degrees of mastery of all the languages that he has studied comes to 3.14159\u00a0...), as well as an \"oligoglot\" (someone who speaks \"a few\" languages).\nIn 1999, the bicentennial year of the Russian poet and writer Alexander Pushkin, Hofstadter published a verse translation of Pushkin's classic novel-in-verse \"Eugene Onegin\". He has translated many other poems, too (always respecting their formal constraints) and two novels (in prose): \"La Chamade\" (\"That Mad Ache\") by French writer Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, and \"La Scoperta dell'Alba\" (\"The Discovery of Dawn\") by Walter Veltroni, the then-head of the Partito Democratico in Italy. \"The Discovery of Dawn\" was published in 2007, and \"That Mad Ache\" was published in 2009, bound together with Hofstadter's essay \"Translator, Trader: An Essay on the Pleasantly Pervasive Paradoxes of Translation\".\nHofstadter's Law.\nHofstadter's Law is \"It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.\" The law is stated in \"GEB\".\nStudents.\nHofstadter's former Ph.D. students include (with dissertation title):\nPublic image.\nHofstadter has said that he feels \"uncomfortable with the nerd culture that centers on computers\". He admits that \"a large fraction [of his audience] seems to be those who are fascinated by technology\", but when it was suggested that his work \"has inspired many students to begin careers in computing and artificial intelligence\" he replied that he was pleased about that, but that he himself has \"no interest in computers\". In that interview he also mentioned a course he has twice given at Indiana University, in which he took a \"skeptical look at a number of highly touted AI projects and overall approaches\". For example, upon the defeat of Garry Kasparov by Deep Blue, he commented that \"It was a watershed event, but it doesn't have to do with computers becoming intelligent\". Hofstadter's disinterest in computers is analogous to an astronomer's disinterest in telescopes. In his book \"Metamagical Themas\", he says that \"in this day and age, how can anyone fascinated by creativity and beauty fail to see in computers the ultimate tool for exploring their essence?\".\nProvoked by predictions of a technological singularity (a hypothetical moment in the future of humanity when a self-reinforcing, runaway development of artificial intelligence causes a radical change in technology and culture), Hofstadter has both organized and participated in several public discussions of the topic. At Indiana University in 1999 he organized such a symposium, and in April 2000, he organized a larger symposium titled \"Spiritual Robots\" at Stanford University, in which he moderated a panel consisting of Ray Kurzweil, Hans Moravec, Kevin Kelly, Ralph Merkle, Bill Joy, Frank Drake, John Holland and John Koza. Hofstadter was also an invited panelist at the first Singularity Summit, held at Stanford in May 2006. Hofstadter expressed doubt that the singularity will occur in the foreseeable future.\nIn 1988 Dutch director Piet Hoenderdos created a docudrama about Hofstadter and his ideas, \"Victim of the Brain\", based on \"The Mind's I\". It includes interviews with Hofstadter about his work.\nColumnist.\nWhen Martin Gardner retired from writing his \"Mathematical Games\" column for \"Scientific American\" magazine, Hofstadter succeeded him in 1981\u201383 with a column titled \"Metamagical Themas\" (an anagram of \"Mathematical Games\"). An idea he introduced in one of these columns was the concept of \"Reviews of This Book\", a book containing nothing but cross-referenced reviews of itself that has an online implementation. One of Hofstadter's columns in \"Scientific American\" concerned the damaging effects of sexist language, and two chapters of his book \"Metamagical Themas\" are devoted to that topic, one of which is a biting analogy-based satire, \"A Person Paper on Purity in Language\" (1985), in which the reader's presumed revulsion at racism and racist language is used as a lever to motivate an analogous revulsion at sexism and sexist language; Hofstadter published it under the pseudonym William Satire, an allusion to William Safire. Another column reported on the discoveries made by University of Michigan professor Robert Axelrod in his computer tournament pitting many iterated prisoner's dilemma strategies against each other, and a follow-up column discussed a similar tournament that Hofstadter and his graduate student Marek Lugowski organized. The \"Metamagical Themas\" columns ranged over many themes, including patterns in Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's piano music (particularly his \u00e9tudes), the concept of superrationality (choosing to cooperate when the other party/adversary is assumed to be equally intelligent as oneself), and the self-modifying game of Nomic, based on the way in which the legal system modifies itself, and developed by philosopher Peter Suber.\nPersonal life.\nHofstadter was married to Carol Ann Brush until her death. They met in Bloomington, and married in Ann Arbor in 1985. They had two children, Danny and Monica. Carol died in 1993 from the sudden onset of a brain tumor \u2014 glioblastoma multiforme \u2014 when their children were 5 and 2. The Carol Ann Brush Hofstadter Memorial Scholarship for Bologna-bound Indiana University students was established in 1996 in her name. Hofstadter's book \"Le Ton beau de Marot\" is dedicated to their two children and its dedication reads \"To M. &amp; D., living sparks of their Mommy's soul\".\nIn the fall of 2010, Hofstadter met Baofen Lin in a cha-cha-cha class, and they married in Bloomington in September 2012.\nHofstadter has composed numerous pieces for piano and a few for piano and voice. He created an audio CD, \"DRH/JJ\", which includes all these compositions performed mostly by pianist Jane Jackson, with a few performed by Brian Jones, Dafna Barenboim, Gitanjali Mathur and Hofstadter.\nThe dedication for \"I Am A Strange Loop\" is: \"To my sister Laura, who can understand, and to our sister Molly, who cannot.\" Hofstadter explains in the preface that his younger sister Molly never developed the ability to speak or understand language.\nAs a consequence of his attitudes about consciousness and empathy, Hofstadter has been a vegan for roughly half his life.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1982 novel ', Arthur C. Clarke's first sequel to ', HAL 9000 is described by Dr. Chandra as being caught in a \"Hofstadter\u2013M\u00f6bius loop\". The movie uses the term \"H. M\u00f6bius loop\".\nOn April 3, 1995, Hofstadter's book \"Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought\" was the first book ever sold by Amazon.com.\nPublished works.\nBooks.\nThe books published by Hofstadter are (the ISBNs refer to paperback editions, where available):\nPapers.\nHofstadter has written, among many others, the following papers:\nHofstadter has also written over 50 papers that were published through the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition.\nInvolvement in other books.\nHofstadter has written forewords for or edited the following books:"}

The Kingdom fell when the last king, B\u00e9hanzin, was defeated by France, leading to the country being annexed into the French colonial empire. Dahomey developed on the Abomey Plateau amongst the Fon people in the early 17th century and became a regional power in the 18th century by conquering key cities on the Atlantic coast.\nFor much of the 18th and 19th centuries, the Kingdom of Dahomey was a key regional state, eventually ending tributary status to the Oyo Empire. The Kingdom of Dahomey was an important regional power that had an organized domestic economy built on conquest and slave labor, significant international trade with Europeans, a centralized administration, taxation systems, and an organized military. Notable in the kingdom were significant artwork, an all-female military unit called the Dahomey Amazons by European observers, and the elaborate religious practices of Vodun with the large festival of the Annual Customs of Dahomey which involved large scale human sacrifice. They traded prisoners, which they captured during wars and raids, and exchanged them with Europeans for goods such as knives, bayonets, firearms, fabrics, and spirits.\nName.\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey was referred to by many different names and has been written in a variety of ways, including \"Danxome\", \"Danhome\", and \"Fon\". The name \"Fon\" relates to the dominant ethnic and language group, the Fon people, of the royal families of the kingdom and is how the kingdom first became known to Europeans. The names \"Dahomey\", \"Danxome\", and \"Danhome\" all have a similar origin story, which historian Edna Bay says may be a false etymology.\nThe story goes that Dakodonu, considered the second king in modern kings lists, was granted permission by the Gedevi chiefs, the local rulers, to settle in the Abomey plateau. Dakodonu requested additional land from a prominent chief named Dan (or Da) to which the chief responded sarcastically \"Should I open up my belly and build you a house in it?\" For this insult, Dakodonu killed Dan and began the construction of his palace on the spot. The name of the kingdom was derived from the incident: Dan=chief dan, xo=Belly, me=Inside of.\nHistory.\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey was established around 1600 by the Fon people who had recently settled in the area (or were possibly a result of intermarriage between the Aja people and the local Gedevi). The foundational king for Dahomey is often considered to be Houegbadja (c. 1645\u20131685), who built the Royal Palaces of Abomey and began raiding and taking over towns outside of the Abomey plateau.\nRule of Agaja (1708\u20131740).\nKing Agaja, Houegbadja's grandson, came to the throne in 1708 and began significant expansion of the Kingdom of Dahomey. This expansion was made possible by the superior military force of King Agaja's Dahomey. In contrast to surrounding regions, Dahomey employed a professional standing army numbering around ten thousand. What the Dahomey lacked in numbers, they made up for in discipline and superior arms. In 1724, Agaja conquered Allada, the origin for the royal family according to oral tradition, and in 1727 he conquered Whydah. This increased size of the kingdom, particularly along the Atlantic coast, and increased power made Dahomey into a regional power. The result was near constant warfare with the main regional state, the Oyo Empire, from 1728 until 1740. The warfare with the Oyo empire resulted in Dahomey assuming a tributary status to the Oyo empire.\nRule of Tegbesu (1740\u20131774).\nTegbesu, also spelled as Tegbessou, was King of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1740 until 1774. Tegbesu was not the oldest son of King Agaja (1718\u20131740), but was selected following his father's death after winning a succession struggle with a brother. King Agaja had significantly expanded the Kingdom of Dahomey during his reign, notably conquering Whydah in 1727. This increased the size of the kingdom and increased both domestic dissent and regional opposition. Tegbessou ruled over Dahomey at a point where it needed to increase its legitimacy over those whom it had recently conquered. As a result, Tegbesu is often credited with a number of administrative changes in the kingdom in order to establish the legitimacy of the kingdom. The slave trade increased significantly during Tegbessou's reign and began to provide the largest part of the income for the king. In addition, Tegbesu's rule is the one with the first significant \"kpojito\" or mother of the leopard with Hwanjile in that role. The \"kpojito\" became a prominently important person in Dahomey royalty. Hwanjile, in particular, is said to have changed dramatically the religious practices of Dahomey by creating two new deities and more closely tying worship to that of the king. According to one oral tradition, as part of the tribute owed by Dahomey to Oyo, Agaja had to give to Oyo one of his sons. The story claims that only Hwanjile, of all of Agaja's wives, was willing to allow her son to go to Oyo. This act of sacrifice, according to the oral tradition made Tegbesu, was favored by Agaja. Agaja reportedly told Tegbesu that he was the future king, but his brother Zinga was still the official heir.\nEnd of the kingdom.\nThe kingdom fought the First Franco-Dahomean War and Second Franco-Dahomean War with France. The kingdom was reduced and made a French protectorate in 1894.\nIn 1904 the area became part of a French colony, French Dahomey.\nIn 1958 French Dahomey became the self-governing colony called the Republic of Dahomey and gained full independence in 1960. It was renamed in 1975 the People's Republic of Benin and in 1991 the Republic of Benin. The Dahomey kingship exists as a ceremonial role to this day.\nPolitics.\nEarly writings, predominantly written by European slave traders, often presented the kingdom as an absolute monarchy led by a despotic king. However, these depictions were often deployed as arguments by different sides in the slave trade debates, mainly in the United Kingdom, and as such were probably exaggerations. Recent historical work has emphasized the limits of monarchical power in the Kingdom of Dahomey. Historian John C. Yoder, with attention to the Great Council in the kingdom, argued that its activities do not \"imply that Dahomey's government was democratic or even that her politics approximated those of nineteenth-century European monarchies. However, such evidence does support the thesis that governmental decisions were molded by conscious responses to internal political pressures as well as by executive fiat.\" The primary political divisions revolved around villages with chiefs and administrative posts appointed by the king and acting as his representatives to adjudicate disputes in the village.\nThe king.\nThe King of Dahomey (\"Ahosu\" in the Fon language) was the sovereign power of the kingdom. All of the kings were claimed to be part of the \"Alladaxonou\" dynasty, claiming descent from the royal family in Allada. Much of the succession rules and administrative structures were created early by Houegbadja, Akaba, and Agaja. Succession through the male members of the line was the norm typically going to the oldest son, but not always. The king was selected largely through discussion and decision in the meetings of the Great Council, although how this operated was not always clear. The Great Council brought together a host of different dignitaries from throughout the kingdom yearly to meet at the Annual Customs of Dahomey. Discussions would be lengthy and included members, both men and women, from throughout the kingdom. At the end of the discussions, the king would declare the consensus for the group.\nThe royal court.\nKey positions in the King's court included the \"migan\", the \"mehu\", the \"yovogan\", the \"kpojito\" (or queen mother), and later the \"chacha\" (or viceroy) of Whydah. The \"migan\" (combination of mi\u2014our and gan\u2014chief) was a primary consul for the king, a key judicial figure, and served as the head executioner. The \"mehu\" was similarly a key administrative officer who managed the palaces and the affairs of the royal family, economic matters, and the areas to the south of Allada (making the position key to contact with Europeans).\nRelations with other states.\nThe relations between Dahomey and other countries were complex and heavily impacted by the slave trade. The Oyo empire engaged in regular warfare with the kingdom of Dahomey and Dahomey was a tributary to Oyo from 1732 until 1823. The city-state of Porto-Novo, under the protection of Oyo, and Dahomey had a long-standing rivalry largely over control of the slave trade along the coast. The rise of Abeokuta in the 1840s created another power rivaling Dahomey, largely by creating a safe haven for people from the slave trade. Slave trade with the Europeans began in the 1600s with contacts with the Portuguese Empire, the Dutch Empire, and the British Empire. By the 1800s, the primary trade had narrowed to the British and when the British reduced the trade this had a large impact on the kingdom, culminating with the 1851-1852 British naval blockade of Dahomey.\nThe last known slave ship that sailed to the United States of America to port in Mobile, Alabama, brought a group of 110 slaves from the Dahomey Kingdom, purchased long after the abolition of the international slave trade. Thomas Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves into law on March 2, effective January 1, 1808. The story was mentioned in the newspaper \"The Tarboro Southerner\" on July 14, 1860. On July 9, 1860, a schooner called \"Clotilda\", captained by William Foster, arrived in the bay of Mobile, Alabama carrying the last known shipment of slaves to the US from the Dahomey Kingdom. In 1858, a man known as Timothy Meaher made a wager with acquaintances that despite the law banning the slave trade, he could safely bring a load of slaves from Africa.\nDescribing how he came in possession of the slaves, Captain William Foster wrote in his journal in 1860, \"from thence I went to see the King of Dahomey. Having agreeably transacted affairs with the Prince we went to the warehouse where they had in confinement four thousand captives in a state of nudity from which they gave me liberty to select one hundred and twenty-five as mine offering to brand them for me, from which I preemptorily [\"sic\"] forbid; commenced taking on cargo of negroes [\"sic\"], successfully securing on board one hundred and ten.\"\nA notable descendant of a slave from this ship is Ahmir Khalib Thompson (American music artist known as Questlove). Mr. Thompson's story is depicted in the PBS Television show \"Finding Your Roots\" [Season 4, Episode 9].\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey also sent a diplomatic mission to Brazil, in 1750, while the country was still under Portuguese rule, in order to strengthen diplomatic relations, after an incident which led to the expulsion of Portuguese-Brazilian diplomatic authorities, in 1743. The interest of maintaining these relations was economic, due to slave trade. It is also important to note that Dahomey was the second country - the first being Portugal - to recognize the independence of Brazil in 1822.\nMilitary.\nThe military of the Kingdom of Dahomey was divided into two units: the right and the left. The right was controlled by the \"migan\" and the left was controlled by the \"mehu\". At least by the time of Agaja, the kingdom had developed a standing army that remained encamped wherever the king was. Soldiers in the army were recruited as young as seven or eight years old, initially serving as shield carriers for regular soldiers. After years of apprenticeship and military experience, they were allowed to join the army as regular soldiers. To further incentivize the soldiers, each soldier received bonuses paid in cowry shells for each enemy they killed or captured in battle. This combination of lifelong military experience and monetary incentives resulted in a cohesive, well-disciplined military. One European said Agaja's standing army consisted of \"elite troops, brave and well-disciplined, led by a prince full of valor and prudence, supported by a staff of experienced officers\".\nIn addition to being well-trained, the Dahomey army under Agaja was also very well armed. The Dahomey army favored imported European weapons as opposed to traditional weapons. For example, they used European flintlock muskets in long-range combat and imported steel swords and cutlasses in close combat. The Dahomey army also possessed twenty-five cannons.\nWhen going into battle, the king would take a secondary position to the field commander with the reason given that if any spirit were to punish the commander for decisions it should not be the king. Unlike other regional powers, the military of Dahomey did not have a significant cavalry (like the Oyo empire) or naval power (which prevented expansion along the coast). The Dahomey Amazons, a unit of all-female soldiers, is one of the most unusual aspects of the military of the kingdom.\nDahomey Amazons.\nThe Dahomean state became widely known for its corps of female soldiers. Their origins are debated; they may have formed from a palace guard or from (female hunting teams).\nThey were organized around 1729 to fill out the army and make it look larger in battle, armed only with banners. The women reportedly behaved so courageously they became a permanent corps. In the beginning, the soldiers were criminals pressed into service rather than being executed. Eventually, however, the corps became respected enough that King Ghezo ordered every family to send him their daughters, with the fittest being chosen as soldiers.\nEconomy.\nThe economic structure of the kingdom was highly intertwined with the political and religious systems and these developed together significantly. The main currency was cowry shells.\nDomestic economy.\nThe domestic economy largely focused on agriculture and crafts for local consumption. Until the development of palm oil, very little agricultural or craft goods were traded outside of the kingdom. Markets served a key role in the kingdom and were organized around a rotating cycle of four days with a different market each day (the market type for the day was religiously sanctioned). Agriculture work was largely decentralized and done by most families. However, with the expansion of the kingdom, agricultural plantations began to be a common agricultural method in the kingdom. Craftwork was largely dominated by a formal guild system.\nHerskovits recounts a complex tax system in the kingdom, in which officials who represented the king, the , gathered data from each village regarding their harvest. Then the king set a tax based upon the level of production and village population. In addition, the king's own land and production were taxed. After significant road construction undertaken by the kingdom, toll booths were also established that collected yearly taxes based on the goods people carried and their occupation. Officials also sometimes imposed fines for public nuisance before allowing people to pass.\nReligion.\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey shared many religious rituals with surrounding populations; however, it also developed unique ceremonies, beliefs, and religious stories for the kingdom. These included royal ancestor worship and the specific vodun practices of the kingdom.\nRoyal ancestor worship.\nEarly kings established clear worship of royal ancestors and centralized their ceremonies in the Annual Customs of Dahomey. The spirits of the kings had an exalted position in the land of the dead and it was necessary to get their permission for many activities on earth. Ancestor worship pre-existed the kingdom of Dahomey; however, under King Agaja, a cycle of ritual was created centered on first celebrating the ancestors of the king and then celebrating a family lineage.\nThe Annual Customs of Dahomey ( or in Fon) involved multiple elaborate components and some aspects may have been added in the 19th century. In general, the celebration involved distribution of gifts, human sacrifice, military parades, and political councils. Its main religious aspect was to offer thanks and gain the approval for ancestors of the royal lineage. However, the custom also included military parades, public discussions, gift giving (the distribution of money to and from the king), and human sacrifice and the spilling of blood.\nHuman sacrifice was an important part of the practice. During the Annual Custom, 500 prisoners would be sacrificed. In addition, when a ruler died, hundreds, to thousands of prisoners would be sacrificed. As many as 4,000 were reported killed In one of these ceremonies in 1727.\nDahomey cosmology.\nDahomey had a unique form of West African Vodun that linked together preexisting animist traditions with vodun practices. Oral history recounted that Hwanjile, a wife of Agaja and mother of Tegbessou, brought Vodun to the kingdom and ensured its spread. The primary deity is the combined Mawu-Lisa (Mawu having female characteristics and Lisa having male characteristics) and it is claimed that this god took over the world that was created by their mother Nana-Buluku. Mawu-Lisa governs the sky and is the highest pantheon of gods, but other gods exist in the earth and in thunder. Religious practice organized different priesthoods and shrines for each different god and each different pantheon (sky, earth or thunder). Women made up a significant amount of the priest class and the chief priest was always a descendant of Dakodonou.\nArts.\nThe arts in Dahomey were unique and distinct from the artistic traditions elsewhere in Africa. The arts were substantially supported by the king and his family, had non-religious traditions, assembled multiple different materials, and borrowed widely from other peoples in the region. Common art forms included wood and ivory carving, metalwork (including silver, iron and brass, appliqu\u00e9 cloth, and clay bas-reliefs).\nThe king was key in supporting the arts and many of them provided significant sums for artists resulting in the unique development, for the region, of a non-religious artistic tradition in the kingdom. Artists were not of a specific class but both royalty and commoners made important artistic contributions. Kings were often depicted in large zoomorphic forms with each king resembling a particular animal in multiple representations.\nSuzanne Blier identifies two unique aspects of art in Dahomey: 1. Assemblage of different components and 2. Borrowing from other states. Assemblage of art, involving the combination of multiple components (often of different materials) combined together in a single piece of art, was common in all forms and was the result of the various kings promoting finished products rather than particular styles. This assembling may have been a result of the second feature, which involved the wide borrowing of styles and techniques from other cultures and states. Clothing, cloth work, architecture, and the other forms of art all resemble other artistic representation from around the region.\nMuch of the artwork revolved around the royalty. Each of the palaces at the Royal Palaces of Abomey contained elaborate bas-reliefs (\"noundid\u0117\" in Fon) providing a record of the king's accomplishments. Each king had his own palace within the palace complex and within the outer walls of their personal palace was a series of clay reliefs designed specific to that king. These were not solely designed for royalty and chiefs, temples, and other important buildings had similar reliefs. The reliefs would present Dahomey kings often in military battles against the Oyo or Mahi tribes to the north of Dahomey with their opponents depicted in various negative depictions (the king of Oyo is depicted in one as a baboon eating a cob of corn). Historical themes dominated representation and characters were basically designed and often assembled on top of each other or in close proximity creating an ensemble effect. In addition to the royal depictions in the reliefs, royal members were depicted in power sculptures known as \"bocio\", which incorporated mixed materials (including metal, wood, beads, cloth, fur, feathers, and bone) onto a base forming a standing figure. The bocio are religiously designed to include different forces together to unlock powerful forces. In addition, the cloth appliqu\u00e9 of Dahomey depicted royalty often in similar zoomorphic representation and dealt with matters similar to the reliefs, often the kings leading during warfare.\nDahomey had a distinctive tradition of casting small brass figures of animals or people, which were worn as jewellery or displayed in the homes of the relatively well-off. These figures, which continue to be made for the tourist trade, were relatively unusual in traditional African art in having no religious aspect, being purely decorative, as well as indicative of some wealth. Also unusual, by being so early and clearly provenanced, is a carved wooden tray (not dissimilar to much more recent examples) in Ulm, Germany, which was brought to Europe before 1659, when it was described in a printed catalogue.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey has been depicted in a number of different literary works of fiction or creative nonfiction. In the novel \"Robur the Conqueror\" (1886) \"Jules Verne\" makes crew and passengers of the \"Albatross\" interrupt an act of human sacrifice. \"In Dahomey\" (1903) was a successful Broadway musical, the first full-length Broadway musical written entirely by African Americans, in the early 20th century. Novelist Paul Hazoum\u00e9's first novel \"Doguicimi\" (1938) was based on decades of research into the oral traditions of the Kingdom of Dahomey during the reign of King Ghezo. The anthropologist Judith Gleason wrote a novel, \"Ag\u00f5t\u0129me: Her Legend\" (1970), centered on one of the wives of a king of Dahomey in the late 18th century, who offends her husband who sells her to slavery in Brazil; she makes a bargain with a \"vodu\" (deity), putting her son on the throne of Dahomey and bringing her home. Another novel tracing the background of a slave, this time in the United States, was \"The Dahomean\", or \"The Man from Dahomey\" (1971), by the African-American novelist Frank Yerby; its hero is an aristocratic warrior. In the third of George McDonald Fraser's Flashman novels, \"Flash for Freedom\" (1971), Flashman dabbles in the slave trade and visits Dahomey. \"The Viceroy of Ouidah\" (1980) by Bruce Chatwin is the story of a Brazilian who, hoping to make his fortune from slave trading, sails to Dahomey in 1812, befriending its unbalanced king and coming to a bad end. The book was later adapted into the film \"Cobra Verde\" (1987) directed by Werner Herzog. The main character of one of the two parallel stories in \"Will Do Magic for Small Change\" (2016) by Andrea Hairston is Kehinde, a Yoruba woman forced into the Dahomean army; she struggles with divided loyalty, and after the fall of Behanzin, joins a French entertainment troupe who intend to exhibit her as an Amazon at the Chicago World's Fair. The Booker prize winning novel \"Girl, Woman, Other\" (2019) by Bernardine Evaristo features a character named Amma who writes and directs a play titled 'The Last Amazon of Dahomey'.\nBehanzin's resistance to the French attempt to end slave trading and human sacrifice has been central to a number of works. Jean Pliya's first play \"Kondo le requin\" (1967), winner of the Grand Prize for African History Literature, tells the story of Behanzin's struggle to maintain the old order. Maryse Cond\u00e9's novel \"The Last of the African Kings\" (1992) similarly focuses on Behanzin's resistance and his exile to the Caribbean.

From the early 17th century onward, dragoons were increasingly also employed as conventional cavalry and trained for combat with swords and firearms from horseback.\nDragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.\nThe name is derived from a type of firearm, called a \"dragon\", which was a handgun version of a blunderbuss, carried by dragoons of the French Army.\nThe title has been retained in modern times by a number of armoured or ceremonial mounted regiments.\nOrigins and name.\nThe establishment of dragoons evolved from the practice of sometimes transporting infantry by horse when speed of movement was needed. In 1552 Prince Alexander of Parma mounted several companies of infantry on pack horses to achieve surprise. Another early instance was ordered by Louis of Nassau in 1572 during operations near Mons in Hainaut, when 500 infantry were transported this way. It is also suggested the first dragoons were raised by the Marshal de Brissac in 1600. According to old German literature, dragoons were invented by Count Ernst von Mansfeld, one of the greatest German military commanders, in the early 1620s. There are other instances of mounted infantry predating this. However Mansfeld, who had learned his profession in Hungary and the Netherlands, often used horses to make his foot troops more mobile, creating what was called an \"arm\u00e9e volante\" (French for \"flying army\").\nDuring Spanish civil wars in Peru in the 16th century, conquistadors fought on horse with arquebuses, prefiguring the origin of European dragoons.\nThe name possibly derives from an early weapon, a short wheellock, called a \"dragon\" because its muzzle was decorated with a dragon's head. The practice comes from a time when all gunpowder weapons had distinctive names, including the culverin, serpentine, falcon, falconet, etc. It is also sometimes claimed a galloping infantryman with his loose coat and the burning match resembled a dragon.\nIt has also been suggested that the name derives from the German \"tragen\" or the Dutch \"dragen\", both being the verb \"to carry\" in their respective languages. Howard Reid claims that the name and role descend from the Latin Draconarius.\nUse as a verb.\nDragoon is occasionally used as a verb to mean to subjugate or persecute by the imposition of troops; and by extension to compel by any violent measures or threats. The term dates from 1689, at a time when dragoons were being used by the French monarchy to persecute Protestants, particularly by forcing Protestants to lodge a dragoon in their house to watch over them, at the householder's expense.\nEarly history and role.\nEarly dragoons were not organized in squadrons or troops as were cavalry, but in companies like the infantry: their officers and non-commissioned officers bore infantry ranks. Dragoon regiments used drummers, not buglers, to communicate orders on the battlefield. The flexibility of mounted infantry made dragoons a useful arm, especially when employed for what would now be termed \"internal security\" against smugglers or civil unrest, and on line of communication security duties. During the English Civil War dragoons were used for a variety of tasks: providing outposts, holding defiles or bridges in the front or rear of the main army, lining hedges or holding enclosures, and providing dismounted musketeers to support regular cavalry. In the closing stages of the Battle of Naseby Okey's Dragoons, who had started the action as dismounted musketeers, got on their horses and charged, possibly the first time this was done.\nSupplied with inferior horses and more basic equipment, the dragoon regiments were cheaper to recruit and maintain than the expensive regiments of cavalry. When in the 17th century Gustav II Adolf introduced dragoons into the Swedish Army, he provided them with a sabre, an axe and a matchlock musket, utilizing them as \"labourers on horseback\". Many of the European armies henceforth imitated this all-purpose set of weaponry. Dragoons of the late 17th and early 18th centuries retained strong links with infantry in appearance and equipment, differing mainly in the substitution of riding boots for shoes and the adoption of caps instead of broad-brimmed hats to enable muskets to be worn slung.\nA non-military use of dragoons was the 1681 Dragonnades, a policy instituted by Louis XIV to intimidate Huguenot families into either leaving France or re-converting to Catholicism by billeting ill-disciplined dragoons in Protestant households. While other categories of infantry and cavalry were also used, the mobility, flexibility and available numbers of the dragoon regiments made them particularly suitable for repressive work of this nature over a wide area.\nIn the Spanish Army, Pedro de la Puente organized a body of dragoons in Innsbruck in 1635. In 1640, a tercio of a thousand dragoons armed with the arquebus was created in Spain. By the end of the 17th century, the Spanish Army had three tercios of dragoons in Spain, plus three in the Netherlands and three more in Milan. In 1704, the Spanish dragoons were reorganised into regiments by Philip V, as were the rest of the tercios.\nTowards the end of 1776, George Washington realized the need for a mounted branch of the American military. In January 1777 four regiments of light dragoons were raised. Short term enlistments were abandoned and the dragoons joined for three years, or \"the war\". They participated in most of the major engagements of the American War of Independence, including the Battles of White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Saratoga, Cowpens, and Monmouth, as well as the Yorktown campaign.\nDragoons were at a disadvantage when engaged against true cavalry, and constantly sought to improve their horsemanship, armament and social status. By the Seven Years' War the primary role of dragoons in most European armies had progressed from that of mounted infantry to that of heavy cavalry. Earlier dragoon responsibilities for scouting and picket duty had passed to hussars and similar light cavalry corps in the French, Austrian, Prussian, and other armies. In the Imperial Russian Army, due to the availability of the Cossack troops, the dragoons were retained in their original role for much longer.\nAn exception to the rule was the British Army. To reduce military budgets, all horse (cavalry) regiments were gradually demoted to dragoons from 1746 onward \u2014 which meant they were paid on a lower scale. When this was completed in 1788, the heavy cavalry regiments had become either Dragoon Guards or Heavy Dragoons (depending on their precedence). The designation of Dragoon Guards did not mean that these regiments (the former 2nd to 8th Horse) had become Household Troops, but simply that they had been given a more dignified title to compensate for the loss of pay and prestige. Starting in 1756, seven regiments of Light Dragoons were raised. These Light Dragoons were trained in reconnaissance, skirmishing and other work requiring endurance in accordance with contemporary standards of light cavalry performance. The success of this new class of cavalry was such that eight regular Dragoon regiments were converted to Light Dragoons between 1768 and 1783.\n19th century.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, dragoons generally assumed a cavalry role, though remaining a lighter class of mounted troops than the armored cuirassiers. Dragoons rode larger horses than the light cavalry and wielded straight, rather than curved swords. Emperor Napoleon often formed complete divisions out of his 30 dragoon regiments and used them as battle cavalry to break the enemy's main resistance. In 1809, French dragoons scored notable successes against Spanish armies at the Battle of Ocana and the Battle of Alba de Tormes.\nBritish heavy dragoons made devastating charges against French infantry at the Battle of Salamanca in 1812 and at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. 31 regiments were in existence at the height of the Napoleonic Wars: seven Dragoon Guards regiments and 24 cavalry of the line regiments. The Dragoon Guards and Dragoon regiments were the heavy cavalry regiments of the British Army, although by continental standards they were not the heaviest type of cavalry since they carried no armour (unlike cuirassiers). While some of the cavalry regiments of the line were simply designated as regiments of \"dragoons\", the lighter cavalry regiments, which were particularly mobile, became regiments of \"Light Dragoons\", employing the 1796-pattern light cavalry sabres. From 1805 four regiments of Light Dragoons were designated Hussars (7th, 10th, 15th and 18th Regiments), differentiated by uniform, and the wearing of mustaches. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars (starting in 1816) some regiments became \" lancers\", identified by the lances that they carried.\nThe creation of a unified German state in 1871 brought together the dragoon regiments of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Mecklenburg, Oldenburg, Baden, Hesse, and W\u00fcrttemberg in a single numbered sequence, although historic distinctions of insignia and uniform were largely preserved. Two regiments of the Imperial Guard were designated as dragoons.\nThe Austrian (later Austro-Hungarian) Army of the 19th century included six regiments of dragoons in 1836, classed as heavy cavalry for shock action, but in practice used as medium troops with a variety of roles. After 1859 all but two Austrian dragoon regiments were converted to cuirassiers or disbanded. From 1868 to 1918 the Austro-Hungarian dragoons numbered 15 regiments.\nDuring the 18th century several regiments of dragoons were created in Spain's American viceroyalties to protect the northern provinces and borders of New Spain in the present-day states of California, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Some of these functioned as a police force. In 1803, the regiments of dragoons began to be called light cavalry (C\"azadores\") and dragoons disappeared from the Spanish Army shortly after 1815.\nIn New Spain, soon to be M\u00e9xico, dragoons were important and elite units of the Royal Army. A number of dragoons became important military and political figures, among them Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama, members of the Queen's Regiment of Dragoons who defected and then initiated the independence movement in M\u00e9xico in 1810. Another important dragoon was Agustin de Iturbide, who would ultimately achieve Mexican independence in 1821. He was known as the greatest horseman in M\u00e9xico and became so renowned in battle during his youth that he acquired the nickname \"El Drag\u00f3n de Hierro\" or \"The Iron Dragon\" (in Spanish, \"dragon\" and \"dragoon\" both sound and are written exactly the same). He would go on to become Agust\u00edn I, after being elected Emperor of M\u00e9xico. The political importance of dragoons during this time in the nascent country cannot be overstated.\nPrior to the War of 1812 the U.S. organized the Regiment of Light Dragoons. For the war a second regiment was activated; that regiment was consolidated with the original regiment in 1814. The original regiment was consolidated with the Corps of Artillery in June 1815.\nThe 1st United States Dragoons explored Iowa after the Black Hawk Purchase put the area under U.S. control. In the summer of 1835, the regiment blazed a trail along the Des Moines river and established outposts from present-day Des Moines to Fort Dodge. In 1933, the State of Iowa opened the Dragoon Trail, a scenic and historic drive that follows the path of the 1st United States Dragoons on their historic march.\nIn 1861 the two existing U.S. Dragoon regiments were re-designated as the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. This reorganization did not affect their role or equipment, although the traditional orange uniform braiding of the dragoons was replaced by the standard yellow of the Cavalry branch. This marked the official end of dragoons in the U.S. Army in name, although certain modern units trace their origins back to the historic dragoon regiments. In practice, all US cavalry assumed a dragoon-like role, frequently utilizing carbines and pistols, in addition to their swords.\nIn several stages between 1816 and 1861, the 21 existing Light Dragoon regiments in the British Army were disbanded or converted to lancers or hussars.\nBetween 1881 and 1907 all Russian cavalry (other than Cossacks and Imperial Guard regiments) were designated as dragoons, reflecting an emphasis on the double ability of dismounted action as well as the new cavalry tactics in their training and a growing acceptance of the impracticality of employing historical cavalry tactics against modern firepower. Upon the reinstatement of Uhlan and Hussar Regiments in 1907 their training pattern, as well as that of the Cuirassiers of the Guard, remained unchanged until the collapse of the Russian Imperial Army.\nIn Japan, during the late 19th and early 20th century, dragoons were deployed in the same way as in other armies, but were dressed as hussars.\n20th century.\nIn 1914 there were still dragoon regiments in the British, French, German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, Canadian, Peruvian, Swiss, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, and Spanish armies. Their uniforms varied greatly, lacking the characteristic features of hussar or lancer regiments. There were occasional reminders of the mounted infantry origins of this class of soldier. Thus the 28 dragoon regiments of the Imperial German Army wore the Pickelhaube (spiked helmet) of the same design as those of the infantry and the British dragoons wore scarlet tunics for full dress while hussars and all but one of the lancer regiments wore dark blue. In other respects however dragoons had adopted the same tactics, roles and equipment as other branches of the cavalry and the distinction had become simply one of traditional titles. Weaponry had ceased to have a historic connection, with both the French and German dragoon regiments carrying lances during the early stages of World War I.\nThe historic German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian dragoon regiments ceased to exist as distinct branches following the overthrow of the respective imperial regimes of these countries during 1917\u201318. The Spanish dragoons, which dated back to 1640, were reclassified as numbered cavalry regiments in 1931 as part of the army modernization policies of the new republic.\nThe Australian Light Horse were similar to 18th-century dragoon regiments in some respects, being mounted infantry which normally fought on foot, their horses' purpose being transportation. They served during the Second Boer War and World War I. The Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade became famous for the Battle of Beersheba in 1917 where they charged on horseback using rifle bayonets, since neither sabres or lances were part of their equipment. Later in the Palestine campaign Pattern 1908 Cavalry Swords were issued and used in the campaign leading to the fall of Damascus.\nProbably the last use of real dragoons (infantry on horseback) in combat was made by the Portuguese Army in the war in Angola during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1966, the Portuguese created an experimental horse platoon, to operate against the guerrillas in the high grass region of Eastern Angola, in which each soldier was armed with a G3 assault rifle for combat on foot and with an automatic pistol to fire from horseback. The troops on horseback were able to operate in difficult terrain unsuited to motor vehicles and had the advantage of being able to control the area around them, with a clear view over the grass that foot troops did not have. Moreover, these unconventional troops created a psychological impact on an enemy that was not used to facing horse troops, and thus had no training or strategy to deal with them. The experimental horse platoon was so successful that its entire parent battalion was transformed from an armored reconnaissance unit to a three-squadron horse battalion known as the \"Dragoons of Angola\". One of the typical operations carried out by the Dragoons of Angola, in cooperation with airmobile forces, consisted of the dragoons chasing the guerrillas and pushing them in one direction, with the airmobile troops being launched from helicopter in the enemy rear, trapping the enemy between the two forces.\nDragoner rank.\nUntil 1918 Dragoner (en: dragoon) was the designation given to the lowest ranks in the dragoon regiments of the Austro-Hungarian and Imperial German Armies. The \"Dragoner\" rank, together with all other private ranks of the different branch of service, did belong to the so-called gemeine rank group.\nModern dragoons.\nBrazil.\nThe Brazilian president's honor guard is provided (amongst other units) by a regiment of dragoons: the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment of the Brazilian Army.\nThis regiment is known as the \"Drag\u00f5es da Independ\u00eancia\" (Independence Dragoons). The name was given in 1927 and refers to the fact that a detachment of dragoons escorted the Prince Royal of Portugal, Pedro I, at the time when he declared Brazilian independence from Portugal, on September 7, 1822.\nThe Independence Dragoons wear 19th-century dress uniforms similar to those of the earlier Imperial Honor Guard, which are used as the regimental full dress uniform since 1927. The uniform was designed by Debret, in white and red, with plumed bronze helmets. The colors and pattern were influenced by the Austrian dragoons of the period, as the Brazilian Empress Consort was also an Austrian Archduchess. The color of the plumes varies according to rank. The Independence Dragoons are armed with lances and sabres, the latter only for the officers and the colour guard.\nThe regiment was established in 1808 by the Prince Regent and future king of Portugal, John VI, with the duty of protecting the Portuguese royal family, which had sought refuge in Brazil during the Napoleonic wars. However dragoons had existed in Portugal since at least the early 18th century and, in 1719, units of this type of cavalry were sent to Brazil, initially to escort shipments of gold and diamonds and to guard the Viceroy who resided in Rio de Janeiro (1st Cavalry Regiment \u2013 Vice-Roy Guard Squadron). Later, they were also sent to the south to serve against the Spanish during frontier clashes. After the proclamation of Brazilian independence, the title of the regiment was changed to that of the Imperial Honor Guard, with the role of protecting the Imperial Family. The Guard was later disbanded by Emperor Peter II and would be recreated only later in the republican era.\nAt the time of the Republic proclamation in 1889, horse #6 of the Imperial Honor Guard was ridden by the officer making the declaration of the end of Imperial rule, Second Lieutenant Eduardo Jos\u00e9 Barbosa. This is commemorated by the custom under which the horse having this number is used only by the commander of the modern regiment.\nCanada.\nThere are three dragoon regiments in the Canadian Army: The Royal Canadian Dragoons and two reserve regiments, the British Columbia Dragoons and the Saskatchewan Dragoons.\nThe Royal Canadian Dragoons is the senior Armoured regiment in the Canadian Army. The regiment was authorized in 1883 as the Cavalry School Corps, being redesignated as Canadian Dragoons in 1892, adding the Royal designation the next year. The RCD has a history of fighting dismounted, serving in the Second Boer War in South Africa as mounted infantry, fighting as infantry with the 1st Canadian Division in Flanders in 1915-1916 and spending the majority of the regiment\u2019s service in the Italian Campaign 1944-1945 fighting dismounted. In 1994 when the regiment deployed to Bosnia as part of the United Nations Protection Force, B Squadron was employed as a mechanized infantry company. The current role of The Royal Canadian Dragoons is to provide Armour Reconnaissance support to 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (2 CMBG) as well as C Squadron RCD in Gagetown supporting the Combat Training Centre with Leopard 2A4 and 2A6 tanks.\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police were accorded the formal status of a regiment of dragoons in 1921. The modern RCMP does not retain any military status however.\nChile.\nFounded as the \"Dragones de la Reina\" (Queen's Dragoons) in 1758 and later renamed the Dragoons of Chile in 1812, and then becoming the Carabineros de Chile in 1903. The Carabineros are the national police of Chile. The military counterpart, that of the 15th Reinforced Regiment \"Dragoons\" is now as of 2010 the 4th Armored Brigade \"Chorrillos\" based in Punta Arenas as the 6th Armored Cavalry Squadron \"Dragoons\", and form part of the 5th Army Division.\nDenmark.\nThe Royal Danish Army includes amongst its historic regiments the Jutish Dragoon Regiment, which was raised in 1670.\nFrance.\nThe modern French Army retains three dragoon regiments from the thirty-two in existence at the beginning of World War I: the 2nd, which is a nuclear, biological and chemical protection regiment, the 5th, an experimental Combined arms regiment, and the 13th (Special Reconnaissance).\nLithuania.\nBeginning in the 17th century, the mercenary army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania included dragoon units. In the middle of the 17th century there were 1,660 dragoons in an army totaling 8,000 men. By the 18th century there were four regiments of dragoons.\nLithuanian cavalrymen served in dragoon regiments of both the Russian and Prussian armies, after the Partitions of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nBetween 1920\u20131924 and 1935\u20131940 the Lithuanian Army included the Third Dragoon \"Iron Wolf\" Regiment. The dragoons were the equivalent of the present-day Volunteer Forces.\nIn modern Lithuania the Grand Duke Butigeidis Battalion (\"Lithuanian: did\u017eiojo kunigaik\u0161\u010dio Butigeid\u017eio drag\u016bn\u0173 batalionas\") is designated as dragoons, with a motorized infantry role.\nMexico.\nDuring the times of the Viceroyalty, regiments of dragoons (Dragon de cuera) were created to defend New Spain. They were mostly horsemen from the provinces. During and after the Mexican war of independence, dragons have played an important role in military conflicts within the country such as the Battle of Puebla during the French intervention, until the Mexican Revolution. One of the best-known military marches in Mexico is the Marcha Dragona (dragon march), the only one currently used by cavalry and motorized units during the parade on September 16 to commemorate Independence Day.\nNorway.\nIn the Norwegian Army during the early part of the 20th century, dragoons served in part as mounted troops, and in part on skis or bicycles (\"hjulryttere\", meaning \"wheel-riders\"). Dragoons fought on horses, bicycles and skis against the German invasion in 1940. After World War II the dragoon regiments were reorganized as armoured reconnaissance units. \"Dragon\" is the rank of a compulsory service private cavalryman while enlisted (regular) cavalrymen have the same rank as infantrymen: \"Grenader\".\nPeru.\nThe Presidential Escort Life Guard Dragoons Regiment \"Field Marshal Domingo Nieto\", named after Field Marshal Domingo Nieto, of the President of the Republic of Per\u00fa were the traditional Guard of the Government Palace of Per\u00fa until March 5, 1987 and its disbandment in that year. However, by Ministerial Resolution No 139-2012/DE/EP of February 2, 2012 the restoration of the Cavalry Regiment \"Marshal Domingo Nieto\" as the official escort of the President of the Republic of Peru was announced. The main mission of the reestablished regiment was to guarantee the security of the President of the Republic and of the Government Palace.\nThis regiment of dragoons was created in 1904 following the suggestion of a French military mission which undertook the reorganization of the Peruvian Army in 1896. The initial title of the unit was Cavalry Squadron \"President's Escort\". It was modelled on the French dragoons of the period. The unit was later renamed as the Cavalry Regiment \"President's Escort\" before receiving its current title in 1949.\nThe Peruvian Dragoon Guard has throughout its existence worn French-style uniforms of black tunic and red breeches in winter and white coat and red breeches in summer, with red and white plumed bronze helmets with the coat of arms of Peru and golden or red epaulettes depending on rank. They retain their original armament of lances and sabres, until the 1980s rifles were used for dismounted drill.\nAt 13:00 hours every day, the main esplanade in front of the Government Palace of Per\u00fa fronting Lima's Main Square serves as the stage for the changing of the guard, undertaken by members of the Presidential Life Guard Escort Dragoons, mounted or dismounted. While the dismounted changing is held on Mondays and Fridays, the mounted ceremony is held twice a month on a Sunday.\nPortugal.\nThe Portuguese Army still maintains two units which are descended from former regiments of dragoons. These are the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry (the former \"Oliven\u00e7a Dragoons\") and the 6th Regiment of Cavalry (the former \"Chaves Dragoons\"). Both regiments are, presently, armoured units. The Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade' Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron \u2013 a unit from the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry \u2013 is known as the \"Paratroopers Dragoons\".\nDuring the Portuguese Colonial War in the 1960s and the 1970s, the Portuguese Army created an experimental horse platoon, to combat the guerrillas in eastern Angola. This unit was soon augmented, becoming a group of three squadrons, known as the \"Angola Dragoons\". The Angola Dragoons operated as mounted infantry \u2013 like the original dragoons \u2013 each soldier being armed with a pistol to fire when on horseback and with an automatic rifle, to use when dismounted. A unit of the same type was being created in Mozambique when the war ended in 1974.\nSpain.\nThe Spanish Army began the training of a dragoon corps in 1635 under the direction of Pedro de la Puente at Innsbruck. In 1640 the first dragoon \"tercio\" was created, equipped with arquebuses and maces. The number of dragoon tercios was increased to nine by the end of the XVII century: three garrisoned in Spain, another three in the Netherlands and the remainder in Milan.\nThe \"tercio\"s were converted into a regimental system, beginning in 1704. Philip V created several additional dragoon regiments to perform the functions of a police corps in the New World. Notable amongst those units were the leather-clad \"dragones de cuera\".\nIn 1803 the dragoon regiments were renamed as \"caballer\u00eda ligera\" (light cavalry). By 1815 these units had been disbanded.\nSpain recreated its dragoons in the late nineteenth century. In 1930, three Spanish dragoon regiments were still in existence.\nSweden.\nIn the Swedish Army, dragoons comprise the Military Police and Military Police Rangers. They also form the 13th Battalion of the Life Guards, which is a military police unit. The 13th (Dragoons) Battalion have roots that go back as far as 1523, making it one of the world's oldest military units still in service. Today, the only mounted units still retained by the Swedish Army are the two dragoons squadrons of the King's Guards Battalion of the Life Guards. Horses are used for ceremonial purposes only, most often when the dragoons take part in the changing of the guards at The Royal Palace in Stockholm. \"\"Livdragon\" is the rank of a private cavalryman.\nSwitzerland.\nIn the Swiss Army, mounted dragoons existed until the early 1970s, when they were converted into Armoured Grenadiers units. The \"Dragoner\"\" had to prove he was able to keep a horse at home before entering the army. At the end of basic training they had to buy a horse at a reduced price from the army and to take it home together with equipment, uniform and weapon. In the \"yearly repetition course\" the dragoons served with their horses, often riding from home to the meeting point.\nThe abolition of the dragoon units, believed to be the last non-ceremonial horse cavalry in Europe, was a contentious issue in Switzerland. On 5 December 1972 the Swiss \"National Council\" approved the measure by 91 votes, against 71 for retention.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the present-day British Army regular army, four regiments are designated as dragoons: The 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards, The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, the Royal Dragoon Guards, and the Light Dragoons. In the Territorial Army, one of the five squadrons of the Royal Yeomanry\u2014the Westminster Dragoons\u2014 also has the title of dragoons.\nUnited States.\nThe 1st and 2nd Battalion, 48th Infantry were mechanized infantry units assigned to the 3rd Armored Division (3AD) in West Germany during the Cold War. The unit crest of the 48th Infantry designated the unit as Dragoons, purely a traditional designation.\nThe 1st Dragoons was reformed in the Vietnam War era as the 1st Squadron, 1st U.S. Cavalry. It served in the Iraq War and remains as the oldest cavalry unit, as well as the most decorated one, in the U.S. Army. Today's modern 1\u20131 Cavalry is a scout/attack unit, equipped with MRAPs, M3A3 Bradley CFVs, and Strykers.\nAnother modern United States Army unit, informally known as the 2nd Dragoons, is the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. This unit was originally organized as the Second Regiment of Dragoons in 1836 and was renamed the Second Cavalry Regiment in 1861, being redesignated as the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in 1948. The regiment is currently equipped with the Stryker family of wheeled fighting vehicles and was redesignated as the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment in 2006. In 2011 the 2nd Dragoon regiment was redesignated as the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment has the distinction of being the longest continuously serving regiment in the United States Army.\nThe 113th Army Band at Fort Knox is also officially nicknamed as \"The Dragoons.\" This derives from its formation as the Band, First Regiment of Dragoons on July 8, 1840.\nCompany D, 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion of the United States Marine Corps, is nicknamed the \"Dragoons\". Their combat history includes Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom from 2002 to 2013.\nExternal links.\nFull"}

{"id": "8769", "revid": "36761066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8769", "title": "Dutch West India Company", "text": "The Dutch West India Company (, or GWC; ; ) was a chartered company of Dutch merchants as well as foreign investors. Among its founders was Willem Usselincx (1567\u20131647) and Jess\u00e9 de Forest (1576\u20131624). On 3 June 1621, it was granted a for a trade monopoly in the Dutch West Indies by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over Dutch participation in the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope) and the Americas, which included the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of New Guinea. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the largely ephemeral Dutch colonization of the Americas (including New Netherland) in the seventeenth century. From 1624 to 1654, in the context of the Dutch-Portuguese War, the GWC held Portuguese territory in northeast Brazil, but they were ousted from Dutch Brazil following fierce resistance.\nAfter several reversals, GWC reorganized and a new charter was granted in 1675, largely on the strength in the Atlantic slave trade. This \"New\" version lasted for more than a century, until after the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, during which it lost most of its assets.\nOrigins.\nWhen the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded in 1602, some traders in Amsterdam did not agree with its monopolistic policies. With help from Petrus Plancius, a Dutch-Flemish astronomer, cartographer and clergyman, they sought for a northeastern or northwestern access to Asia to circumvent the VOC monopoly. In 1609, English explorer Henry Hudson, in employment of the VOC, landed on the coast of New England and sailed up what is now known as the Hudson River in his quest for the Northwest Passage to Asia. However, he failed to find a passage. Consequently, in 1615 Isaac Le Maire and Samuel Blommaert, assisted by others, focused on finding a south-westerly route around South America's Tierra del Fuego archipelago in order to circumvent the monopoly of the VOC.\nOne of the first sailors who focused on trade with Africa was Balthazar de Moucheron. The trade with Africa offered several possibilities to set up trading posts or factories, an important starting point for negotiations. It was Blommaert, however, who stated that, in 1600, eight companies sailed on the coast of Africa, competing with each other for the supply of copper, from the Kingdom of Loango. Pieter van den Broecke was employed by one of these companies. In 1612, a Dutch fortress was built in Mouree (present day Ghana), along the Dutch Gold Coast.\nTrade with the Caribbean, for salt, sugar and tobacco, was hampered by Spain and delayed because of peace negotiations. Spain offered peace on condition that the Dutch Republic would withdraw from trading with Asia and America. Spain refused to sign the peace treaty if a West Indian Company would be established. At this time, the Dutch War of Independence (1568\u20131648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic was occurring. Grand Pensionary Johan van Oldenbarnevelt offered to only suspend trade with the West in exchange for the Twelve Years' Truce. The result was that, during a few years, the company sailed under a foreign flag in South America. However, ten years later, Stadtholder Maurice of Orange, proposed to continue the war with Spain, but also to distract attention from Spain to the Republic. In 1619, his opponent Johan van Oldenbarnevelt was beheaded, and when two years later the truce expired, the West Indian Company was established.\nThe West India Company received its charter from the States-General in 1621, but its foundation had been suggested much earlier in the 17th century only to be delayed by the conclusion of the Twelve Years' Truce between Spain and the United Provinces in 1609.\nThe West India Company.\nThe \"Dutch West India Company\" was organized similarly to the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Like the VOC, the GWC company had five offices, called chambers (\"kamers\"), in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Hoorn, Middelburg and Groningen, of which the chambers in Amsterdam and Middelburg contributed most to the company. The board consisted of 19 members, known as the Heeren XIX (the Nineteen Gentlemen). The institutional structure of the GWC followed the federal structure, which entailed extensive discussion for any decision, with regional representation: 8 from Amsterdam; 4 from Zeeland, 2 each from the Northern Quarter (Hoorn and Enkhuizen), the Maas (Rotterdam and Dordrecht), the region of Groningen, and one representative from the States General. Each region had its own chamber and board of directors. The validity of the charter was set at 24 years.\nOnly in 1623 was funding arranged, after several bidders were put under pressure. The States General of the Netherlands and the VOC pledged one million guilders in the form of capital and subsidy. Although Iberian writers said that crypto-Jews or Marranos played an important role in the formation of both the VOC and the GWC, research has shown that initially they played a minor role, but expanded during the period of the Dutch in Brazil. Emigrant Calvinists from the Spanish Netherlands did make significant investments in the GWC. Investors did not rush to put their money in the company in 1621, but the States-General urged municipalities and other institutions to invest. Explanations for the slow investment by individuals were that shareholders had \"no control over the directors' policy and the handling of ordinary investors' money,\" that it was a \"racket\" to provide \"cushy posts for the directors and their relatives, at the expense of ordinary shareholders\". The VOC directors invested money in the GWC, without consulting their shareholders, causing dissent among a number of shareholders. In order to attract foreign shareholders, the GWC offered equal standing to foreign investors with Dutch, resulting in shareholders from France, Switzerland, and Venice. A translation of the original 1621 charter appeared in English, \"Orders and Articles granted by the High and Mightie Lords the States General of the United Provinces concerning the erecting of a West-Indies Companie, Anno Dom. MDCXII\". by 1623, the capital for the GWC at 2.8\u00a0million florins was not as great the VOC's original capitalization of 6.5\u00a0million, but it was still a substantial sum. The GWC had 15 ships to carry trade and plied the west African coast and Brazil.\nUnlike the VOC, the GWC had no right to deploy military troops. When the Twelve Years' Truce in 1621 was over, the Republic had a free hand to re-wage war with Spain. A \"Groot Desseyn\" (\"grand design\") was devised to seize the Portuguese colonies in Africa and the Americas, so as to dominate the sugar and slave trade. When this plan failed, privateering became one of the major goals within the GWC. The arming of merchant ships with guns and soldiers to defend themselves against Spanish ships was of great importance. On almost all ships in 1623, 40 to 50 soldiers were stationed, possibly to assist in the hijacking of enemy ships. It is unclear whether the first expedition was the expedition by Jacques l'Hermite to the coast of Chile, Peru and Bolivia, set up by Stadtholder Maurice with the support of the States General and the VOC.\nThe company was initially a dismal failure, in terms of its expensive early projects, and its directors shifted emphasis from conquest of territory to pursue plunder of shipping. The most spectacular success for the GWC was Piet Heyn's seizure of the Spanish silver fleet, which carried silver from Spanish colonies to Spain. He had also seized a consignment of sugar from Brazil and a galleon from Honduras with cacao, indigo, and other valuable goods. Privateering was its most profitable activity in the late 1620s. Despite Heyn's success at plunder, the company's directors realized that it was not a basis to build long-term profit, leading them to renew their attempts to seize Iberian territory in the Americas. They decided their target was Brazil.\nThere were conflicts between directors from different areas of The Netherlands, with Amsterdam less supportive of the company. Non-maritime cities, including Haarlem, Leiden, and Gouda, along with Enkhuizen and Hoorn were enthusiastic about seizing territory. They sent a fleet to Brazil, capturing Olinda and Pernambuco in 1630 in their initial foray to create a Dutch Brazil, but could not hold them due to a strong Portuguese resistance. Company ships continued privateering in the Caribbean, as well seizing vital land resources, particularly salt pans. The company's general lack of success saw their shares plummet and the Dutch and The Spanish renewed truce talks in 1633.\nIn 1629 the GWC gave permission to a number of investors in New Netherlands to found patroonships, enabled by the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions which was ratified by the Dutch States-General on June 7, 1629. The patroonships were created to help populate the colony, by providing investors grants providing land for approximately 50 people and \"upwards of 15 years old\", per grant, mainly in the region of New Netherland. Patroon investors could expand the size of their land grants as large as 4 miles, \"along the shore or along one bank of a navigable river...\" Rensselaerswyck was the most successful Dutch West India Company patroonship.\nThe New Netherland area, which included New Amsterdam, covered parts of present-day New York, Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey. Other settlements were established on the Netherlands Antilles, and in South America, in Dutch Brazil, Suriname and Guyana. In Africa, posts were established on the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the Slave Coast (now Benin), and briefly in Angola. It was a neo-feudal system, where patrons were permitted considerable powers to control the overseas colony. In the Americas, fur (North America) and sugar (South America) were the most important trade goods, while African settlements traded the enslaved (mainly destined for the plantations on the Antilles and Suriname), gold, and ivory.\nDecline.\nIn North America, the settlers Albert Burgh, Samuel Blommaert, Samuel Godijn, Johannes de Laet had little success with populating the colony of New Netherland, and to defend themselves against local Amerindians. Only Kiliaen Van Rensselaer managed to maintain his settlement in the north along the Hudson. Samuel Blommaert secretly tried to secure his interests with the founding of the colony of New Sweden on behalf of Sweden on the Delaware in the south. The main focus of the GWC now went to Brazil.\nOnly in 1630 did the West India Company manage to conquer a part of Brazil. In 1630, the colony of New Holland (capital Mauritsstad, present-day Recife) was founded, taking over Portuguese possessions in Brazil. In the meantime, the war demanded so many of its forces that the company had to operate under a permanent threat of bankruptcy. In fact, the GWC went bankrupt in 1636 and all attempts at rehabilitation were doomed to failure.\nBecause of the ongoing war in Brazil, the situation for the GWC in 1645, at the end of the charter, was very bad. An attempt to compensate the losses of the GWC with the profits of the VOC failed because the directors of the VOC did not want to. Merging the two companies was not feasible. Amsterdam was not willing to help out, because it had too much interest in peace and healthy trade relations with Portugal. This indifferent attitude of Amsterdam was the main cause of the slow, half-hearted policy, which would eventually lead to losing the colony. In 1647 the company made a restart using 1.5\u00a0million guilders, capital of the VOC. The States General took responsibility for the warfare in Brazil.\nDue to the Peace of Westphalia the seizing of Spanish ships was no longer allowed. Many merchants from Amsterdam and Zeeland decided to work with marine and merchants from Hamburg, Gl\u00fcckstadt (then Danish), England and other countries. In 1649, the GWC obtained a monopoly on gold and enslaved Africans in the kingdom of Accra (present-day Ghana). In 1662 there were contacts with the owners of the Asiento, which were obliged to deliver 24,000 enslaved Africans. In 1663 and 1664 the GWC sold more enslaved Africans than the Portuguese and English together.\nThe first West India Company suffered a long agony, and its end in 1674 was painless. The reason that the GWC could drag on for twenty years was due to its valuable West African possessions, due to its slaves.\nNew West India Company.\nWhen the GWC could not repay its debts in 1674, the company was dissolved. But because of high demand for trade with the West (mainly slave trade), and the fact that still many colonies existed, it was decided to establish the Second Chartered West India Company (also called New West India Company) in 1675. This new company had the same trade area as the first. All ships, fortresses, etc. were taken over by the new company. The number of directors was reduced from 19 to 10, and the number of governors from 74 to 50. The new GWC had a capital that was slightly more than guilders around 1679, which was largely supplied by the Amsterdam Chamber.\nFrom 1694 until 1700, the GWC waged a long conflict against the Eguafo Kingdom along the Gold Coast, present-day Ghana. The Komenda Wars drew in significant numbers of neighbouring African kingdoms and led to replacement of the gold trade with enslaved Africans.\nAfter the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, it became apparent that the Dutch West India Company was no longer capable of defending its own colonies, as Sint Eustatius, Berbice, Essequibo, Demerara, and some forts on the Dutch Gold Coast were rapidly taken by the British. In 1791, the company's stock was bought by the Dutch government, and on 1 January 1792, all territories previously held by the Dutch West India Company reverted to the rule of the States General of the Dutch Republic. Around 1800 there was an attempt to create a third West Indian Company, without any success."}

It is one of the Manding languages and is most closely related to Bambara, being mutually intelligible with Bambara as well as Malinke. It is a trade language in West Africa and is spoken by millions of people, either as a first or second language. Like the other Mande languages, it is a tonal language. It is written in the Latin script and the Arabic script, as well as in the indigenous N'Ko script.\nWriting systems and phonology.\nLatin alphabet and orthography.\nDioula orthography is regulated in Burkina Faso by the Dioula Sub-Commission of the National Commission for Languages. On 15 July 1971, the National Sub-Commission for Dioula was created and on 16 July 1971, it began a study in order to set the Dioula alphabet. An alphabet was published on 27 July 1973 and gained official status on 2 February 1979. Some letters were added later, for borrowed words, and others were replaced: by , and by .\nIn Burkina Faso, the Dioula alphabet is made up of 28 letters each representing a single phoneme. In the orthography, long vowels are represented by doubled letters; thus, /e/ is written and /e\u02d0/, . The nasalisation of a vowel is written followed by an n; for example, /\u1ebd/ is written .\nThe seven vowel sounds may also be either lengthened /i\u02d0 e\u02d0 \u025b\u02d0 a\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0 o\u02d0 u\u02d0/ or nasalized /\u0129 \u1ebd \u025b\u0303 \u00e3 \u0254\u0303 \u00f5 \u0169/.\nThe notation of tones was recommended in 1973, but in practice they are not written. The transcription guide published in 2003 does not reiterate this recommendation. Tones are noted solely in lexicographical works. However, to avoid ambiguity, tone marking is obligatory in certain cases.\nFor example:\nN'Ko alphabet.\nThe N'Ko script is an indigenous writing system for the Manding language continuum, invented in 1949 by Solomana Kant\u00e9, a Guinean educator. Today, the script has been digitised as part of Unicode, which allows it to be used easily online, but the lack of funding and the official status of French means that use of this alphabet is largely happens outside of formal education and is not systematically used on street signs, etc.\nUse in media.\nDioula can be heard spoken in the 2004 film \"Night of Truth\", directed by Fanta R\u00e9gina Nacro, Burkina Faso's first female director."}

He is best known for his role as the witty Ricky Ricardo on the American television sitcom \"I Love Lucy\", in which he co-starred with his then wife Lucille Ball. Arnaz and Ball are generally credited as the innovators of the syndicated rerun, which they pioneered with the \"I Love Lucy\" series.\nArnaz and Lucille Ball co-founded and ran the television production company called Desilu Productions, originally to market \"I Love Lucy\" to television networks. After \"I Love Lucy\" ended, Arnaz went on to produce several other television series, at first with Desilu Productions, and later independently, including \"The Ann Sothern Show\" and \"The Untouchables\". He was also renowned for leading his Latin music band, the Desi Arnaz Orchestra.\nEarly life.\nArnaz was born Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha, III, in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, to Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Alberni II (March 8, 1894 \u2013 May 31, 1973) and Dolores \"Lolita\" de Acha y de Socias (April 2, 1896 \u2013 October 24, 1988). His father was Santiago's youngest mayor and also served in the Cuban House of Representatives. His maternal grandfather was Alberto de Acha, an executive at rum producer Bacardi &amp; Co.\nArnaz describes the opulent family life of his early youth in his autobiography, \"A Book\" (1976)\u2014the family owned three ranches, a palatial home, and a vacation mansion on a private island in Santiago Bay, Cuba. Following the Cuban Revolution of 1933, led by Fulgencio Batista, which overthrew President Gerardo Machado, Alberto Arnaz was jailed and all of his property was confiscated. He was released after six months when his brother-in-law Alberto de Acha intervened on his behalf. The family then fled to Miami, where Desi attended St. Patrick Catholic High School in Miami Beach. In the summer of 1934, he attended Saint Leo Prep (near Tampa) to help improve his English. His first job was working at Woolworths in Miami. He then went into the tile business with his father before turning to show business full-time.\nProfessional career.\nMusician and actor.\nAfter finishing high school, Arnaz formed a band, the Siboney Septet, and began making a name for himself in Miami. Xavier Cugat, after seeing Arnaz perform, hired him for his touring orchestra, playing the conga drum and singing. Becoming a star attraction encouraged him to start his own band, the Desi Arnaz Orchestra.\nArnaz and his orchestra became a hit in New York City's club scene, where he introduced the concept of conga line dancing to the city. He came to the attention of Rodgers and Hart who, in 1939, cast him in their Broadway musical \"Too Many Girls\". The show was a hit and RKO Pictures bought the movie rights.\nArnaz went to Hollywood the next year to appear in the show's movie version at RKO, which also starred Lucille Ball. Arnaz and Ball fell in love during the film's production and eloped on November 30, 1940.\nArnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s such as \"Bataan\", starring Robert Taylor (1943). Many consider his portrayal of the jive-loving California National Guardsman Felix Ramirez to be his best early role.\nHe received his draft notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the United States Army during World War II. He was assigned to direct United Service Organization (USO) programs at the Birmingham General Army Hospital in the San Fernando Valley. Discovering the first thing the wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them.\nHe served 2 years, 7 months and 4 days in the Army as a Staff Sergeant. For his service during World War II, he was awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. Following his discharge from the Army on December 1, 1945, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings. He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend Marco Rizo to play piano and arrange for the orchestra.\nFor the 1946\u201347 season, Arnaz was the bandleader, conducting his Desi Arnaz Orchestra, on Bob Hope's radio show (\"The Pepsodent Show\") on NBC.\nIn 1951, Arnaz was given a game show on CBS Radio, \"Your Tropical Trip\" in order to entice Arnaz and Ball to stay at CBS over a competing offer from NBC, and to keep Arnaz and his band employed and in Hollywood, rather than touring. The musical game show, hosted by Arnaz, had audience members competing for a Caribbean vacation and also featured Arnaz's orchestra. The program aired from January 1951 until September, shortly before the premiere of \"I Love Lucy\" in October.\nWhen he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for \"I Love Lucy\".\n\"I Love Lucy\".\nOn October 15, 1951, Arnaz co-starred in the premiere of \"I Love Lucy\", in which he played a fictionalized version of himself, Cuban orchestra leader Enrique \"Ricky\" Ricardo. His co-star was his real-life wife, Lucille Ball, who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series \"My Favorite Husband\" for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. CBS wanted Ball's \"Husband\" co-star Richard Denning.\nThe original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful show business couple whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so Jess Oppenheimer changed it to make Ricky Ricardo a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent. The character name \"Larry Lopez\" was dropped because of a real-life bandleader named Vincent Lopez, and was replaced with \"Ricky Ricardo\". The name was inspired by Henry Richard, a family friend and the brother of P.C. Richard of P.C. Richard &amp; Son. This name translates to Enrique Ricardo. Ricky often appeared at, and later owned, the Tropicana Club, which under his ownership he renamed Club Babalu.\nInitially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latin American Arnaz portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that Desi's Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers. The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together, during the summer of 1950, in a live vaudeville act they developed with the help of Spanish clown Pepito P\u00e9rez, together with Ball's radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act, including Lucy's memorable seal routine, was used in the pilot episode of \"I Love Lucy\". Segments of the pilot were recreated in the sixth episode of the show's first season. During his time on the show, Arnaz and Ball became TV's most successful entrepreneurs.\nDesilu Productions.\nWith Ball, Arnaz founded Desilu Productions in 1950, initially to produce the vaudeville-style touring act that led to \"I Love Lucy\". At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only kinescope images. Karl Freund, Arnaz's cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the multiple-camera setup production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent situation comedies. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a sound stage, but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and adhere to fire and safety codes.. Due to the expense of 35mm film, Arnaz and Ball agreed to salary cuts. In return they retained the rights to the films. This was the basis for their invention of re-runs and syndicating TV shows (a huge source of new revenue).\nIn addition to \"I Love Lucy\", he executive produced \"The Ann Sothern Show\" and \"Those Whiting Girls\" (starring Margaret Whiting and Barbara Whiting Smith), and was involved in several other series such as \"The Untouchables\", \"Whirlybirds\", and \"Sheriff of Cochise\" / \"United States Marshal\". He also produced the feature film \"Forever, Darling\" (1956), in which he and Ball starred. In the late 1950s, Arnaz proposed a Western television series to his then neighbor, Victor Orsatti, who formed a production company, Ror-Vic, in partnership with actor Rory Calhoun. Ror-Vic produced \"The Texan\", which aired on Monday evenings on CBS from 1958 to 1960. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two black-and-white segments filmed weekly through Desilu Studios. Despite the name, the series was filmed mostly in Pearl Flats in the Mojave Desert of Southern California. The program could have been renewed for a third season had Calhoun not desired to return to films.\nThe original Desilu company continued long after Arnaz's divorce from Ball and her subsequent marriage to Gary Morton. Desilu produced its own programs and provided facilities to other producers. Desilu produced \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", \"The Lucy Show\", ', and '. When Ball sold her share of Desilu to what became Paramount Television, Arnaz went on to form his own production company from his share of Desilu. With the newly formed Desi Arnaz Productions, he made \"The Mothers-In-Law\" (at Desilu) for United Artists Television and NBC. This sitcom ran for two seasons from 1967 to 1969. Arnaz's company was succeeded-in-interest by the company now known as Desilu, Too. Desilu, Too and Lucille Ball Productions worked hand-in-hand with MPI Home Video in the home video reissues of the Ball/Arnaz material not owned by CBS (successor-in-interest to Paramount Television, which in turn succeeded the original Desilu company). This material included \"Here's Lucy\" and \"The Mothers-In-Law\", as well as many programs and specials Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other.\nPersonal life.\nBeliefs.\nArnaz and Ball decided that the show would maintain what Arnaz termed \"basic good taste\" and were therefore determined to avoid ethnic jokes, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.\nArnaz was deeply patriotic about the United States. In his memoirs, he wrote that he knew of no other country in the world where \"a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language\" could achieve the successes that he had.\nMarriages.\nArnaz and Lucille Ball were married on November 30, 1940. Their marriage was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her and also because he came home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the interlocutory decree became final. Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actors Lucie Arnaz (born 1951) and Desi Arnaz Jr. (born 1953).\nArnaz's marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his growing problems with alcohol and infidelity. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company, as well as supervising its day-to-day operations, had greatly worsened as it grew much larger, and he felt compelled to seek outlets to alleviate the stress. Arnaz was also suffering from diverticulitis. Ball divorced him in 1960. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.\nArnaz married his second wife, Edith Eyre Hirsch (n\u00e9e McSkimming), on March 2, 1963, and greatly reduced his show business activities. He served as executive producer of \"The Mothers-in-Law\", and during its two-year run, made four guest appearances as a Spanish matador, Se\u00f1or Delgado. Edith died in 1985, aged 67, from cancer.\nAlthough Arnaz and Ball both married other spouses after their divorce in 1960, they remained friends and grew closer in his final decade. \"\"I Love Lucy\" was never just a title\", wrote Arnaz in the last years of his life. Family home video later aired on television showed Ball and Arnaz playing together with their grandson Simon shortly before Arnaz's death.\nLater life.\nIn the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week of shows with daytime host and producer Mike Douglas. Vivian Vance appeared as a guest. Arnaz also headlined a \"Kraft Music Hall\" special on NBC that featured his two children, with a brief appearance by Vance. To promote his autobiography, \"A Book\", on February 21, 1976, Arnaz served as a guest host on \"Saturday Night Live\", with his son, Desi, Jr., also appearing. The program contained spoofs of \"I Love Lucy\" and \"The Untouchables\". The spoofs of \"I Love Lucy\" were supposed to be earlier concepts of the show that never made it on the air, such as \"I Love Louie\", where Desi lived with Louis Armstrong. He read Lewis Carroll's poem \"Jabberwocky\" in a heavy Cuban accent (he pronounced it \"Habberwocky\"). Desi Jr., played the drums and, supported by the \"SNL\" band, Desi sang both \"Babal\u00fa\" and another favorite from his dance band days, \"Cuban Pete\"; the arrangements were similar to the ones used on \"I Love Lucy\". He ended the broadcast by leading the entire cast in a raucous conga line through the \"SNL\" studio.\nDesi Arnaz contributed to charitable and nonprofit organizations, including San Diego State University. He also taught classes at San Diego State in studio production and acting for television. Arnaz made a guest appearance on the TV series \"Alice\", starring Linda Lavin and produced by \"I Love Lucy\" co-creators Madelyn Pugh (Madelyn Davis) and Bob Carroll, Jr.\nThoroughbred racing.\nArnaz and his wife eventually moved to Del Mar, California where he lived the rest of his life in semi-retirement. He owned a horse-breeding farm in Corona, California and raced Thoroughbreds. The Desi Arnaz Stakes at Del Mar Racetrack is named in his honor.\nDeath.\nArnaz was a regular smoker for much of his life and often smoked cigarettes on the set of \"I Love Lucy\". He smoked Cuban cigars until he was in his sixties. Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1986, and died several months later on December 2, 1986, at the age of 69. Arnaz was cremated and his ashes scattered. His death came just five days before Lucille Ball received the Kennedy Center Honors. He was predeceased by his second wife, Edith, who had died a year earlier on March 23, 1985. His mother outlived him by almost two years.\nLegacy.\nDesi Arnaz has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one at 6301 Hollywood Boulevard for contributions to motion pictures and one at 6250 Hollywood Boulevard for television. Unlike his co-stars, Arnaz was never nominated for an Emmy for his performance in \"I Love Lucy\". In 1956, he won a Golden Globe for Best Television Achievement for helping to shape the American Comedy through his contributions in front of and behind the camera of \"I Love Lucy\". He was inducted into the Television Academy's Hall of Fame.\nThe Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center museum is in Jamestown, New York, and the Desi Arnaz Bandshell in the Lucille Ball Memorial Park is in Celoron, New York.\nDesi Arnaz appears as a character in Oscar Hijuelos's 1989 novel \"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love\" and is portrayed by his son, Desi Arnaz Jr., in the 1992 film adaptation, \"The Mambo Kings\".\nArnaz was portrayed by Oscar Nu\u00f1ez in \"I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom\", a comedy about how Arnaz and Ball battled to get their sitcom on the air. It had its world premiere in Los Angeles on July 12, 2018, co-starring Sarah Drew as Lucille Ball and Seamus Dever as \"I Love Lucy\" creator-producer-head writer Jess Oppenheimer. The play, written by Jess Oppenheimer's son, Gregg Oppenheimer, was recorded in front of a live audience for nationwide public radio broadcast and online distribution.\nOn March 2, 2019, Google celebrated what would have been Arnaz's 102nd birthday with a Google doodle.\nThe Amazon film \"Lucy and Desi\" was proposed in 2015 and was still in development in May 2020, without a casting for Arnaz."}

They can be divided between those that have two strands of DNA in their genome, called double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, and those that have one strand of DNA in their genome, called single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses. dsDNA viruses primarily belong to two realms: \"Duplodnaviria\" and \"Varidnaviria\", and ssDNA viruses are almost exclusively assigned to the realm \"Monodnaviria\", which also includes dsDNA viruses. Additionally, many DNA viruses are unassigned to higher taxa. Viruses that have a DNA genome that is replicated through an RNA intermediate by a reverse transcriptase are separately considered reverse transcribing viruses and are assigned to the kingdom \"Pararnavirae\" in the realm \"Riboviria\".\nDNA viruses are ubiquitous worldwide, especially in marine environments where they form an important part of marine ecosystems, and infect both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They appear to have multiple origins, as viruses in \"Monodnaviria\" appear to have emerged from archaeal and bacterial plasmids on multiple occasions, though the origins of \"Duplodnaviria\" and \"Varidnaviria\" are less clear. Prominent disease-causing DNA viruses include herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, and poxviruses.\nBaltimore classification.\nThe Baltimore classification system is used to group viruses together based on their manner of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis and is often used alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary history. DNA viruses constitute two Baltimore groups: Group I: double-stranded DNA viruses, and Group II: single-stranded DNA viruses. While Baltimore classification is chiefly based on transcription of mRNA, viruses in each Baltimore group also typically share their manner of replication. Viruses in a Baltimore group do not necessarily share genetic relation or morphology.\nDouble-stranded DNA viruses.\nThe first Baltimore group of DNA viruses are those that have a double-stranded DNA genome. All dsDNA viruses have their mRNA synthesized in a three-step process. First, a transcription preinitiation complex binds to the DNA upstream of the site where transcription begins, allowing for the recruitment of a host RNA polymerase. Second, once the RNA polymerase is recruited, it uses the negative strand as a template for synthesizing mRNA strands. Third, the RNA polymerase terminates transcription upon reaching a specific signal, such as a polyadenylation site.\ndsDNA viruses make use of several mechanisms to replicate their genome. Bidirectional replication, in which two replication forks are established at a replication origin site and move in opposite directions of each other, is widely used. A rolling circle mechanism that produces linear strands while progressing in a loop around the circular genome is also common. Some dsDNA viruses use a strand displacement method whereby one strand is synthesized from a template strand, and a complementary strand is then synthesized from the prior synthesized strand, forming a dsDNA genome. Lastly, some dsDNA viruses are replicated as part of a process called replicative transposition whereby a viral genome in a host cell's DNA is replicated to another part of a host genome.\ndsDNA viruses can be subdivided between those that replicate in the nucleus, and as such are relatively dependent on host cell machinery for transcription and replication, and those that replicate in the cytoplasm, in which case they have evolved or acquired their own means of executing transcription and replication. dsDNA viruses are also commonly divided between tailed dsDNA viruses, referring to members of the realm \"Duplodnaviria\", usually the tailed bacteriophages of the order \"Caudovirales\", and tailless or non-tailed dsDNA viruses of the realm \"Varidnaviria\".\nSingle-stranded DNA viruses.\nThe second Baltimore group of DNA viruses are those that have a single-stranded DNA genome. ssDNA viruses have the same manner of transcription as dsDNA viruses. However, because the genome is single-stranded, it is first made into a double-stranded form by a DNA polymerase upon entering a host cell. mRNA is then synthesized from the double-stranded form. The double-stranded form of ssDNA viruses may be produced either directly after entry into a cell or as a consequence of replication of the viral genome. Eukaryotic ssDNA viruses are replicated in the nucleus.\nMost ssDNA viruses contain circular genomes that are replicated via rolling circle replication (RCR). ssDNA RCR is initiated by an endonuclease that bonds to and cleaves the positive strand, allowing a DNA polymerase to use the negative strand as a template for replication. Replication progresses in a loop around the genome by means of extending the 3'-end of the positive strand, displacing the prior positive strand, and the endonuclease cleaves the positive strand again to create a standalone genome that is ligated into a circular loop. The new ssDNA may be packaged into virions or replicated by a DNA polymerase to form a double-stranded form for transcription or continuation of the replication cycle.\nParvoviruses contain linear ssDNA genomes that are replicated via rolling hairpin replication (RHR), which is similar to RCR. Parvovirus genomes have hairpin loops at each end of the genome that repeatedly unfold and refold during replication to change the direction of DNA synthesis to move back and forth along the genome, producing numerous copies of the genome in a continuous process. Individual genomes are then excised from this molecule by the viral endonuclease. For parvoviruses, either the positive or negative sense strand may be packaged into capsids, varying from virus to virus.\nNearly all ssDNA viruses have positive sense genomes, but a few exceptions and peculiarities exist. The family \"Anelloviridae\" is the only ssDNA family whose members have negative sense genomes, which are circular. Parvoviruses, as previously mentioned, may package either the positive or negative sense strand into virions. Lastly, bidnaviruses package both the positive and negative linear strands.\nICTV classification.\nThe International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) oversees virus taxonomy and organizes viruses at the basal level at the rank of realm. Virus realms correspond to the rank of domain used for cellular life but differ in that viruses within a realm do not necessarily share common ancestry, nor do the realms share common ancestry with each other. As such, each virus realm represents at least one instance of viruses coming into existence. Within each realm, viruses are grouped together based on shared characteristics that are highly conserved over time. Three DNA virus realms are recognized: \"Duplodnaviria\", \"Monodnaviria\", and \"Varidnaviria\".\n\"Duplodnaviria\".\n\"Duplodnaviria\" contains dsDNA viruses that encode a major capsid protein (MCP) that has the HK97 fold. Viruses in the realm also share a number of other characteristics involving the capsid and capsid assembly, including an icosahedral capsid shape and a terminase enzyme that packages viral DNA into the capsid during assembly. Two groups of viruses are included in the realm: tailed bacteriophages, which infect prokaryotes and are assigned to the order \"Caudovirales\", and herpesviruses, which infect animals and are assigned to the order \"Herpesvirales\".\n\"Duplodnaviria\" is either monophyletic or polyphyletic and may predate the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of cellular life. The exact origin of the realm is not known, but the HK97-fold found in the MCP of all members is, outside the realm, only found in encapsulins, a type of nanocompartment found in bacteria, although the relation between \"Duplodnaviria\" and encapsulins is not fully understood.\nThe relation between caudoviruses and herpesviruses is not certain, as they may either share a common ancestor or herpesviruses may be a divergent clade from within \"Caudovirales\". A common trait among duplodnaviruses is that they cause latent infections without replication while still being able to replicate in the future. Tailed bacteriophages are ubiquitous worldwide, important in marine ecology, and the subject of much research. Herpesviruses are known to cause a variety of epithelial diseases, including herpes simplex, chickenpox and shingles, and Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\"Monodnaviria\".\n\"Monodnaviria\" contains ssDNA viruses that encode an endonuclease of the HUH superfamily that initiates rolling circle replication and all other viruses descended from such viruses. The prototypical members of the realm are called CRESS-DNA viruses and have circular ssDNA genomes. ssDNA viruses with linear genomes are descended from them, and in turn some dsDNA viruses with circular genomes are descended from linear ssDNA viruses. \nViruses in \"Monodnaviria\" appear to have emerged on multiple occasions from archaeal and bacterial plasmids, a type of extra-chromosomal DNA molecule that self-replicates inside its host. The kingdom \"Shotokuvirae\" in the realm likely emerged from recombination events that merged the DNA of these plasmids and complementary DNA encoding the capsid proteins of RNA viruses.\nCRESS-DNA viruses include three kingdoms that infect prokaryotes: \"Loebvirae\", \"Sangervirae\", and \"Trapavirae\". The kingdom \"Shotokuvirae\" contains eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viruses and the atypical members of \"Monodnaviria\". Eukaryotic monodnaviruses are associated with many diseases, and they include papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses, which cause many cancers, and geminiviruses, which infect many economically important crops.\n\"Varidnaviria\".\n\"Varidnaviria\" contains DNA viruses that encode MCPs that have a jelly roll fold folded structure in which the jelly roll (JR) fold is perpendicular to the surface of the viral capsid. Many members also share a variety of other characteristics, including a minor capsid protein that has a single JR fold, an ATPase that packages the genome during capsid assembly, and a common DNA polymerase. Two kingdoms are recognized: \"Helvetiavirae\", whose members have MCPs with a single vertical JR fold, and \"Bamfordvirae\", whose members have MCPs with two vertical JR folds.\nVaridnaviria is either monophyletic or polyphyletic and may predate the LUCA. The kingdom \"Bamfordvirae\" is likely derived from the other kingdom \"Helvetiavirae\" via fusion of two MCPs to have an MCP with two jelly roll folds instead of one. The single jelly roll (SJR) fold MCPs of \"Helvetiavirae\" show a relation to a group of proteins that contain SJR folds, including the Cupin superfamily and nucleoplasmins.\nMarine viruses in \"Varidnaviria\" are ubiquitous worldwide and, like tailed bacteriophages, play an important role in marine ecology. Most identified eukaryotic DNA viruses belong to the realm. Notable disease-causing viruses in \"Varidnaviria\" include adenoviruses, poxviruses, and the African swine fever virus. Poxviruses have been highly prominent in the history of modern medicine, especially \"Variola virus\", which caused smallpox. Many varidnaviruses are able to become endogenized in their host's genome, and a peculiar example of this are virophages, which confer protection for their hosts against giant viruses during infection.\nBy Baltimore group.\ndsDNA viruses are classified into three realms and include many taxa that are unassigned to a realm:\nssDNA viruses are classified into one realm and include several families that are unassigned to a realm:"}
{"id": "8778", "revid": "32526417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8778", "title": "Daniel Ortega", "text": "Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ortega Saavedra (; born November 11, 1945) is a Nicaraguan politician serving as President of Nicaragua since 2007; previously he was leader of Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, first as Coordinator of the Junta of National Reconstruction (1979\u20131985) and then as President (1985\u20131990). A leader in the Sandinista National Liberation Front (; FSLN), he implemented policies to achieve leftist reforms across Nicaragua. In later years, Ortega's previously far left politics moderated more and more, pursuing pro-business policies and even rapprochement with the Catholic Church, with the adoption of strong anti-abortion policies by his government in the 2000s, and adoption of strong religious rhetoric by the previously atheist Ortega.\nBorn into a working-class family, from an early age Ortega opposed Nicaragua's dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, and became involved in the underground movement against his government. Joining the Sandinistas as a student in 1963, Ortega became involved with urban resistance activities and was arrested and imprisoned in 1967. Ortega, like many political prisoners of the Somoza regime, was tortured and abused in jail. Upon release in 1974, he was exiled to Cuba, where he received training in guerrilla warfare from Fidel Castro's Marxist\u2013Leninist government. \nOrtega played a crucial role in forming the Insurrectionist faction, which united the FSLN and sparked the mass uprisings of 1978\u20131979, culminating in the Nicaraguan Revolution. After the overthrow and exile of Somoza's government, Ortega became leader of the ruling multi-partisan Junta of National Reconstruction. In 1984, Ortega won Nicaragua's disputed presidential election with over 60% of the vote as the FSLN's candidate. A Marxist\u2013Leninist, Ortega pursued a program of nationalization, land reform, wealth redistribution and literacy programs during his first period in office.\nOrtega's relationship with the United States was never very cordial, as the US had long supported the Somoza Family's dictatorship. Although the US initially supplied the ruined post-revolution Nicaragua with economic aid, relations quickly soured. His government was beset by violent opposition from US-backed rebels (known as the Contras). This illegal intervention continued (albeit covertly) after Ortega's democratic election as president in 1984. Peace talks between five Central American heads of state in July 1987 led to the signing of the Central American Peace Accords, and the beginning of a roadmap to the end of the conflict. In 1988, the Contras first entered into peace talks with the Sandinista government, although the violence continued, as did their US support. Despite US opposition, disarmament of the Contras began in 1989. The US continued the economic embargo, promising to lift it only if the Sandinistas were ousted in the election, providing financial support to the opposition candidate, and promising aid to Nicaragua should she be elected.\nAfter a difficult presidency marred by war and economic collapse, Ortega was defeated in the 1990 general election by Violeta Chamorro. He continued to be an important figure in Nicaraguan opposition politics. Ortega was an unsuccessful candidate for president in 1996 and 2001, but he won the 2006 presidential election. In office, he made alliances with fellow Latin American socialists, such as Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Under Ortega's leadership, Nicaragua joined the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. \nHis second administration has become increasingly antidemocratic, alienating many of his former revolutionary allies. In June 2018, Amnesty International and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States reported that Ortega had engaged in a violent oppression campaign against protesters in response to anti-Ortega protests since April 2018. Government officials and government-owned media denied responsibility for such actions.\nEarly life.\nOrtega was born in La Libertad, department of Chontales, Nicaragua. His parents, Daniel Ortega Cerda and Lidia Saavedra, were opposed to the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. His mother was imprisoned by Somoza's National Guard for being in possession of \"love letters,\" which the police said were coded political missives. Ortega and his two brothers, grew up to become revolutionaries. His brother Humberto Ortega is a former general, military leader, and published writer, and Camilo Ortega has also been politically active. They had a sister, Germania, who died.\nSeeking stable employment, the family migrated from La Libertad to the provincial capital of Juigalpa, and then to a working-class neighborhood in Managua. Their father Daniel Ortega Cedra detested US military intervention in Nicaragua and Washington's support for the Somoza dictatorship. He imparted this anti-American sentiment to his sons.\nOrtega was first arrested for political activities at the age of 15, and quickly joined the then-underground Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). In 1964, Ortega travelled to Guatemala, where the police arrested him and turned him over to the Nicaraguan National Guard. After his release from detainment, Ortega arranged the assassination of his torturer, Guardsman Gonzalo Lacayo, in August 1967. \nHe was imprisoned in 1967 for taking part in armed robbery of a branch of the Bank of America. He told collaborators that they should be killed if they did not take part in the robbery. Ortega was released in late 1974, along with other Sandinista prisoners, in exchange for Somocista hostages. While imprisoned at the El Modelo jail, just outside Managua, Ortega wrote poems, one of which he titled \"I Never Saw Managua When Miniskirts Were in Fashion\". During his imprisonment, Ortega was severely tortured. While he was incarcerated at El Modelo, his mother helped stage protests and hunger strikes for political prisoners; this resulted in improving the treatment of incarcerated Sandinistas. \nAfter being released, Ortega was exiled to Cuba. There he received several months of guerrilla training. He later returned secretly to Nicaragua.\nIn the late 1970s, divisions over the FSLN's campaign against Somoza led Ortega and his brother Humberto to form the Insurrectionist, or Tercerista (Third Way) faction. The Terceristas sought to combine the distinct guerrilla war strategies of the two other factions, Tom\u00e1s Borge's Guerra Prolongada Popular (GPP, or Prolonged People's War), and Jaime Wheelock's Proletarians. The Ortega brothers forged alliances with a wide array of anti-Somoza forces, including Catholic and Protestant activists, and other non-Marxist civil society groups. The Terceristas became the most effective faction in wielding political and military strength, and their push for FSLN solidarity received the support of revolutionary leaders such as Fidel Castro.\nOrtega married Rosario Murillo in 1979 in a secret ceremony. They moved to Costa Rica with her three children from a previous marriage. Ortega remarried Murillo in 2005 in order to have the marriage recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, as part of his effort to reconcile with the church. The couple has eight children, three of them together. Murillo serves as the Ortega government's spokeswoman and a government minister, among other positions. Ortega adopted stepdaughter Zoilam\u00e9rica Narv\u00e1ez in 1986, through a court case.\nSandinista revolution (1979\u20131990).\nWhen Somoza was overthrown by the FSLN in July 1979, Ortega became a member of the five-person Junta of National Reconstruction, which included Sandinista militant Mois\u00e9s Hassan, novelist Sergio Ram\u00edrez, businessman Alfonso Robelo, and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the widow of a murdered journalist. In September 1979, United States President Carter hosted Ortega at the White House, and warned him against arming other Central American leftist guerrilla movements. At the time, Ortega spoke truthfully when he denied Sandinista involvement in neighboring countries. When Ortega questioned the Americans about CIA support for anti-Sandinista groups, Carter and Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the reports were false. After the meeting, Carter asked Congress for $75 million in aid to Nicaragua, contingent on the Sandinista government's promise not to aid other guerrillas.\nThe FSLN came to dominate the junta, Robelo and Chamorro resigned, and in 1981 Ortega became the coordinator of the Junta. As the only member of the FSLN National Directorate in the Junta, he was the effective leader of the country. After attaining power, the FSLN embarked upon an ambitious programme of social reform. They arranged to redistribute of land to about 100,000 families; launched a literacy drive, and made health care improvements that ended polio through mass vaccinations, and reduced the frequency of other treatable diseases. The Sandinista nationalization efforts affected mostly banks and industries owned by the extended Somoza family. More than half of all farms, businesses, and industries remained in private hands. The revolutionary government wanted to preserve a mixed economy and support private sector investment. The Superior Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP) opposed the Sandinistas\u2019 economic reform. The main organization of Nicaraguan big business was composed of prosperous families from the Pacific coast cities, who dominated commerce and banking. Ortega took a very hard line against opposition to his policies: On February 21, 1981, the Sandinista army killed 7 Miskito Indians and wounded 17. \nOrtega's administration forced displacement of many of the indigenous population: 10,000 individuals had been moved by 1982. Thousands of Indians fled to take refuge across the border in Honduras, and Ortega's government imprisoned 14,000 in Nicaragua. Anthropologist Gilles Bataillon termed this \"politics of ethnocide\" in Nicaragua. The Indians formed two rebel groups \u2013 the Misura and Misurasata. They were joined in the north by Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) and in the south by former Sandinistas and peasantry who, under the leadership of Ed\u00e9n Pastora, were resisting forced collectivization.\nIn 1980 the Sandinista government launched the massive Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign, and claimed the illiteracy rate fell from 50% to 13% in the span of five months. These figures are disputed, as many \"unteachable\" illiterates were omitted from the statistics, and many people declared literate were found to be unable to read or write a simple sentence. The UNESCO awarded Nicaragua the Nadezhda K. Krupskaya prize in recognition of its efforts. The FSLN also focused on improving the Nicaraguan health system, particularly through vaccination campaigns and the construction of public hospitals. These actions reduced child mortality by half, to 40 deaths per thousand. By 1982, the World Health Organization deemed Nicaragua a model for primary health care.\nIn 1981, United States President Ronald Reagan accused the FSLN of joining with Soviet-backed Cuba in supporting Marxist revolutionary movements in other Latin American countries, such as El Salvador. People within the Reagan administration authorized the CIA to begin financing, arming and training rebels as anti-Sandinista guerrillas, some of whom were former officers from Somoza's National Guard. These were known collectively as the Contras. This resulted in one of the largest political scandals in US history, (the Iran\u2013Contra affair). Oliver North and several members of the Reagan administration defied the Boland Amendment, selling arms to Iran and using the proceeds in order to secretly fund the Contras. \nThe Contra war claimed 30,000 lives in Nicaragua. The tactics used by the Sandinista government to fight the Contras have been widely condemned for their suppression of civil rights. On March 15, 1982, the Junta declared a state of siege, which allowed it to close independent radio stations, suspend the right of association, and limit the freedom of trade unions. Nicaragua's Permanent Commission on Human Rights condemned Sandinista human rights violations, accusing them of killing and forcibly disappearing thousands of persons in the first few years of the war.\nAt the 1984 general election Ortega won the presidency with 67% of the vote and took office on January 10, 1985. In the early phases of the campaign, Ortega enjoyed many institutional advantages, and used the full power of the press, police, and Supreme Electoral Council against the fractured opposition. In the weeks before the November election, Ortega gave a U.N. speech denouncing talks held in Rio de Janeiro on electoral reform. But by October 22, the Sandinistas signed an accord with opposition parties to reform electoral and campaign laws, making the process more fair and transparent. While campaigning, Ortega promoted the Sandinistas\u2019 achievements, and at a rally claimed that \u201cDemocracy is literacy, democracy is land reform, democracy is education and public health.\u201d International observers judged the election to be the first free election held in the country in more than half a century. A report by an Irish governmentary delegation stated: \"The electoral process was carried out with total integrity. The seven parties participating in the elections represented a broad spectrum of political ideologies.\" The general counsel of New York's Human Rights Commission described the election as \"free, fair and hotly contested.\" A study by the US Latin American Studies Association (LASA) concluded that the FSLN (Sandinista Front) \"did little more to take advantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere (including the U.S.) routinely do.\" However some people described the election as \"rigged\". According to a detailed study, since the 1984 election was for posts subordinate to the Sandinista Directorate, the elections were no more subject to approval by vote than the Central Committee of the Communist Party is in countries of the East Bloc.\nThirty-three per cent of the Nicaraguan voters cast ballots for one of six opposition parties\u2014three to the right of the Sandinistas, three to the left\u2014which had campaigned with the aid of government funds and free T.V. and radio time. Two conservative parties captured a combined 23% of the vote. They held rallies across the country (a few of which were disrupted by FSLN supporters) and blasted the Sandinistas in harsh terms. Most foreign and independent observers noted this pluralism in debunking the Reagan administration charge\u2014ubiquitous in the US media\u2014that it was a \"Soviet-style sham\" election. Some opposition parties boycotted the election, allegedly under pressure from US embassy officials, and so it was denounced as being unfair by the Reagan administration. Reagan thus maintained that he was justified to continue supporting what he referred to as the Contras' \"democratic resistance\".\nIn opposition (1990\u20132007).\nIn the 1990 presidential election, Ortega lost his reelection bid to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, his former colleague in the junta. Chamorro was supported by the US and a 14-party anti-Sandinista alliance known as the National Opposition Union (Uni\u00f3n Nacional Oppositora, UNO), an alliance that ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists. She ran an effective campaign, presenting herself as the peace candidate and promising to end the US-funded Contra War if she won. Ortega campaigned on the slogan, \"Everything Will Be Better,\" and promised that, with the Contra war over, he could focus on the nation's recovery. Contrary to what most observers expected, Chamorro shocked Ortega and won the election. Chamorro's UNO coalition garnered 54% of the vote, and won 51 of the 92 seats in the National Assembly. Immediately after the loss, the Sandinistas tried to maintain unity around their revolutionary posture. In Ortega's concession speech the following day he vowed to keep \"ruling from below\" a reference to the power that the FSLN still wielded in various sectors. He also stressed his belief that the Sandinistas had the goal of bringing \"dignity\" to Latin America, and not necessarily to hold on to government posts. In 1991, Ortega claimed elections were \u201can instrument to reaffirm\u201d the FSLN's \u201cpolitical and ideological positions,\u201d and also \u201cconfront capitalism.\u201d However, the electoral loss led to pronounced divisions in the FSLN. Some members adopted more pragmatic positions, and sought to transform the FSLN into a modern social democratic party engaged in national reconciliation and class cooperation. Ortega and other party insiders found common ground with the radicals, who still promoted anti-imperialism and class conflict to achieve social change.\nPossible explanations for his loss include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless Violeta Chamorro won. Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras, with a Canadian observer mission claiming that 42 people were killed by the contras in \"election violence\" in October 1989. This led many commentators to assume that Nicaraguans voted against the Sandinistas out of fear of a continuation of the contra war and economic deprivation.\nFrom July 19\u201321, 1991, the FSLN held a National Congress to mend the rifts between members and form a new overarching political program. The effort failed to unite the party, and intense debates over the internal governance of the FSLN continued. The pragmatists, led by the former vice president Sergio Ramirez, formed the basis of a \"renovating\" faction, and supported collaboration with other political forces to preserve the rule of law in Nicaragua. Under the leadership of Ortega and Tomas Borge, the radicals regrouped into the \"principled\" faction, and branded themselves the Izquierda Democratica (ID), or Democratic Left (DL). The DL fought the Chamorro government with disruptive labor strikes and demonstrations, and renewed calls for the revolutionary reconstruction of Nicaraguan society. During the May 20\u201323, 1994, extraordinary congress, Ortega ran against a fellow National Directorate member, Henry Ruiz, for the position of party secretary-general. Ortega was elected with 287 to Ruiz's 147 votes, and the DL secured the most dominant role in the FSLN.\nOn September 9, 1994, Ortega gained more power after taking over Sergio Ramirez's seat in the Asamblea Sandinista (Sandinista Assembly). Ramirez had served as chief of the FSLN's parliamentary caucus since 1990, but Ortega came to oppose his actions in the National Assembly, setting the stage for Ramirez's removal. Historic leaders, such as Ernesto Cardenal, a former minister of culture in the Sandinista government, rejected Ortega's consolidation of power: \u201cMy resignation from the FSLN has been caused by the kidnapping of the party carried out by Daniel Ortega and the group he heads.\u201d The party formally split on January 8, 1995, when Ramirez and a number of prominent Sandinista officials quit.\nOrtega ran for election again, in October 1996 and November 2001, but lost on both occasions to Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n and Enrique Bola\u00f1os, respectively. In these elections, a key issue was the allegation of corruption. In Ortega's last days as president, through a series of legislative acts known as \"The Pi\u00f1ata\", estates that had been seized by the Sandinista government (some valued at millions and even billions of US dollars) became the private property of various FSLN officials, including Ortega himself.\nIn the 1996 campaign, Ortega faced the Liberal Alliance (Alianza Liberal), headed by Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo, a former mayor of Managua. The Sandinistas softened their anti-imperialist rhetoric, with Ortega calling the US \u201cour great neighbor,\u201d and vowing to cooperate \u201cwithin a framework of respect, equality, and justice.\u201d The image change failed, as Aleman's Liberal Alliance came first with 51.03% of the vote, while Ortega's FSLN secured 37.75%.\nOrtega's policies became more moderate during his time in opposition, and he gradually changed much of his former Marxist stance in favor of an agenda of democratic socialism. His Roman Catholic faith has become more public in recent years as well, leading Ortega to embrace a variety of socially conservative policies; in 2006 the FSLN endorsed a strict law banning all abortions in Nicaragua. In the run-up to the 2006 elections, Ortega displayed his ties to the Catholic Church by renewing his marriage vows before Cardinal Miguel Obanda y Bravo.\nOrtega was instrumental in creating the controversial strategic pact between the FSLN and the Constitutional Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Constitucionalista, PLC). The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising. After sealing the agreement in January 2000, the two parties controlled the three key institutions of the state: the Comptroller General of the Republic, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Electoral Council. \"El Pacto,\" as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Alem\u00e1n greatly, while constraining then-president Bola\u00f1os. One of the key accords of the pact was to lower the ratio necessary to win a presidential election in the first round from 45% to 35%, a change in electoral law that would become decisive in Ortega's favor in the 2006 elections.\nAt the Fourth Ordinary Congress of the FSLN, held March 17\u201318, 2002, Ortega eliminated the National Directorate (DN). Once the main collective leadership body of the party, with nine members, the DN no longer met routinely, and only three historic members remained. Instead, the body just supported decisions already made by the secretary-general. Ortega sidelined party officials and other members while empowering his own informal circle, known as the ring of iron.\n2001 presidential election.\nIn the November 2001 general elections, Ortega lost his third successive presidential election, this time to Enrique Bola\u00f1os of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party.\nUnder Ortega's direction, the FSLN formed the broad National Convergence (Convergencia Nacional) coalition in opposition to the PLC. Ortega abandoned the revolutionary tone of the past, and infused his campaign with religious imagery, giving thanks in speeches to \u201cGod and the Revolution\u201d for the post-1990 democracy, and claimed a Sandinista victory would enable the Nicaraguan people to \u201cpass through the sea and reach the Promised Land.\u201d The US opposed Ortega's candidacy from the beginning. The US ambassador even made an appearance with the PLC's Enrique Bolanos while distributing food aid. The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks doomed Ortega's chances, as the threat of a US invasion became an issue. Bolanos convinced many Nicaraguans that the renewed US hostility towards terrorism would endanger their country if the openly anti-US Ortega prevailed. Bolanos ended up with 56.3% of the vote, and Ortega won 42.3%.\n2006 presidential election.\nIn 2006, Daniel Ortega was elected president with 38% of the vote. This occurred despite the fact that the breakaway Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) continued to oppose the FSLN, running former Mayor of Managua Herty Lewites as its candidate for president. Ortega personally attacked Lewites\u2019 Jewish background, compared him to Judas, and warned he \u201ccould end up hanged.\u201d However, Lewites died several months before the elections.\nOrtega emphasized peace and reconciliation in his campaign, and selected a former Contra leader, Jaime Morales Corazo, as his running mate. The FSLN also won 38 seats in the congressional elections, becoming the party with the largest representation in parliament. The split in the Constitutionalist Liberal Party helped allow the FSLN to become the largest party in Congress; however, the Sandinista vote had a minuscule split between the FSLN and MRS, and that the liberal party combined is larger than the Frente Faction. In 2010, several liberal congressmen raised accusations about the FSLN presumably attempting to buy votes to pass constitutional reforms that would allow Ortega to run for office for the 6th time since 1984.\nSecond presidency (2007\u2013present).\nDuring his reign as president starting in 2007, Ortega has been described as taking \"full control of all four branches of government, state institutions, the military, and police\", and in the process dismantled \"Nicaragua\u2019s institutional democracy\" (journalist Tim Rogers); taking under his control \"every aspect of government ... the National Assembly, the Supreme Court, the armed forces, the judiciary, the police and the prosecutor\u2019s office\" (journalist, Frances Robles); \"aggressively dismantled all institutional checks on presidential power\" (Human Rights Watch).\nIn June 2008 the Nicaraguan Supreme Court disqualified the MRS and the Conservative Party from participation in municipal elections. In November 2008, the Supreme Electoral Council received national and international criticism following irregularities in municipal elections, but agreed to review results for Managua only, while the opposition demanded a nationwide review. For the first time since 1990, the Council decided not to allow national or international observers to witness the election. Instances of intimidation, violence, and harassment of opposition political party members and NGO representatives have been recorded. Official results show Sandinista candidates winning 94 of the 146 municipal mayoralties, compared to 46 for the main opposition Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC). The opposition claimed that marked ballots were dumped and destroyed, that party members were refused access to some of the vote counts and that tallies from many polling places were altered. As a result of the fraud allegations, the European Union suspended $70m of aid, and the US $64m.\nWith the late-2000s recession, Ortega in 2011 characterised capitalism as in its \"death throes\" and portrayed the Bolivarian Alternative for the People of Our America (ALBA) is the most advanced, most Christian and fairest project. He also said God was punishing the United States with the financial crisis for trying to impose its economic principles on poor countries. \"It's incredible that in the most powerful country in the world, which spends billions of dollars on brutal wars ... people do not have enough money to stay in their homes.\"\nBefore the National Sandinista Council held in September 2009, Lenin Cerna, the secretary of the party organization, called for diversifying its political strategies. He declared the FSLN's future depended on implementing new plans, \u201cso that the party can advance via new routes and in new ways, always under Ortega\u2019s leadership.\u201d Ortega gained power over the selection of candidates, allowing him to personally choose all candidates for public office.\nDuring an interview with David Frost for the Al Jazeera English programme \"Frost Over The World\" in March 2009, Ortega suggested that he would like to change the constitution to allow him to run again for president. In Judicial Decision 504, issued on October 19, 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua declared portions of Articles 147 and 178 of the Constitution of Nicaragua inapplicable; these provisions concerned the eligibility of candidates for president, vice-president, mayor, and vice-mayor\u2014a decision that had the effect of allowing Ortega to run for reelection in 2011.\nFor this decision, the Sandinista magistrates formed the required quorum by excluding the opposition magistrates and replacing them with Sandinista substitutes, violating the Nicaraguan constitution. Opposing parties, the church and human rights groups in Nicaragua denounced the decision. Throughout 2010, court rulings gave Ortega greater power over judicial and civil service appointments.\nWhile supporting abortion rights during his presidency during the 1980s, Ortega has since embraced the Catholic Church's position of strong opposition. While non-emergency abortions have long been illegal in Nicaragua, recently even abortions \"in the case where the pregnancy endangers the mother's life\", otherwise known as therapeutic abortions have been made illegal in the days before the 2006 election, with a six-year prison term in such cases, too\u2014a move supported by Ortega.\nOrtega was re-elected president with a vote on November 6 and confirmation on November 16, 2011. During the election, the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) blocked both domestic and international poll observers from multiple polling stations. According to the Supreme Electoral Council, Ortega defeated Fabio Gadea, with 63% of the vote.\nIn January 2014 the National Assembly, dominated by the FSLN, approved constitutional amendments that abolished term limits for the presidency and allowed a president to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms. Although billed as a measure to ensure stability, critics charged that the amendments threatened Nicaraguan democracy. The constitutional reforms also gave Ortega the sole power to appoint military and police commanders.\nAs of 2016, Ortega's family owns three of the nine free-to-air television channels in Nicaragua, and controls a fourth (the public Channel 6). Four of the remaining five are controlled by Mexican mogul \u00c1ngel Gonz\u00e1lez, and are generally considered to be aligned with Ortega's ruling FSLN party. There are no government restrictions on Internet use; the Ortega administration attempted to gain complete control over online media in 2015, but failed due to opposition from civil society, political parties, and private organizations.\nIn June 2016, the Nicaraguan supreme court ruled to oust Eduardo Montealegre, the leader of the main opposition party, leaving the main opposition coalition with no means of contesting the November 2016 national elections. In August 2016, Ortega chose his wife, Rosario Murillo, as his vice-presidential running-mate for re-election.\nAccording to the \"Washington Post\", figures announced on November 7, 2016 put Daniel Ortega in line for his third consecutive term as President, also being his fourth term overall. The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) reported Ortega and Murillo won 72.4% of the vote, with 68% turnout. The opposition coalition had called the election a \"farce\" and had called for the boycott of the election. International observers were not allowed to observe the vote. Nevertheless, according to the BBC, Ortega was the most popular candidate by far, possibly due to Nicaragua's stable economic growth and lack of violence compared to its neighbours El Salvador and Honduras in recent years.\nAccording to Tim Rogers, until the 2018 unrest, as president Ortega presided over \"the fastest-growing economy in Central America\" and was a \"poster child for foreign investment and citizen security in a region known for gangs and unrest\". During this time the Ortega government formed an alliance with the Superior Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP), Nicaragua's council of business chambers. However the same unpopular decree which \"unilaterally overhauling the social-security tax system\" (mentioned below) and precipitated the unrest in April 2018, also broke Ortega's arrangement with COSEP, and along with US sanctions, brought a sharp economic drop that as of mid-2020 is still \"crippling\" Nicaragua's economy.\nPresident Ortega's government has been the target of criticism for its lack of a response to the pandemic. \nAccording to CNN, as of mid-June 2020, Ortega has \"refused to impose strict, preventive quarantine measures seen in neighboring countries\" to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Public schools remain open, businesses continue to operate, festivals and cultural events are happening on an almost-weekly basis.\" The story states that from mid-March to mid-June six politicians have died, and according to witnesses, their remains disposed of at night in \"express burials\" (with police in attendance but \"no Mass, no wake and no funeral arrangements\", no photographs). The Ortega government has denied reports of \"express burials\" as \"false news.\" According to AP News \"the government has threatened to ban\" professional baseball players \"who refuse to play baseball ... And everyone is warned to keep quiet.\"\nIn hospitals \"ruling-party activists ensure no information leaks out\", and it quotes a doctor (anesthesiologist Mar\u00eda Nela Escoto) complaining that in the public hospital where she works \"everything is secret. They don\u2019t allow suggestions, and you can\u2019t question anything because they\u2019re watching. It\u2019s a very hostile environment.\u201d\n2018 unrest.\nIn April 2018, student protests over a nature reserve fire expanded to cover an unpopular decree that would have cut social security benefits and increased taxpayer contributions. The protesters were violently set upon by the state sponsored Sandinista Youth. Despite attempts by Ortega's government to hide the incident through censorship of all private-owned news outlets, photos and videos of the violence made their way to social media where they sparked outrage and urged more Nicaraguans to join in on the protests. Tensions escalated quickly, as police began using tear gas canisters and rubber bullets, and eventually live ammunition on unarmed protesters. Authorities were also seen arming Sandinista Youth members with weapons to serve as paramilitary forces. Dozens of student protesters were subsequently killed. Despite the withdrawal of the unpopular decree, the protests continue, with most protesters demanding Ortega's and his cabinet's resignations. As the protests continue, support for the Ortega-Murillo regime dwindles.\nOn May 30, 2018 Nicaragua's Mother's Day, over 300,000 people marched to honor the mothers of students killed in the preceding protests. Despite the attendance of children, mothers and retirees, and lack of any violence by marchers, marchers were attacked in an event dubbed the \"Mother's Day Massacre\". 16 were killed, and 88 injured, as \"police sprayed the crowd with bullets, government sharpshooters positioned on the roof of the national baseball stadium went headhunting with sniper rifles\".\nBy June 2018 Tim Rogers of The Atlantic magazine described the situation:Over the past seven weeks, Ortega\u2019s police and paramilitaries have killed more than 120 people, mostly students and other young protesters who are demanding the president\u2019s ouster and a return to democracy, according to a human-rights group [CENIDH, Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights]. Police hunt students like enemy combatants. Sandinista Youth paramilitaries, armed and paid by Ortega\u2019s party, drive around in pickup trucks attacking protesters. Gangs of masked men loot and burn shops with impunity. Cops wear civilian clothing, and some paramilitaries dress in police uniforms. \u201cThis is starting to look more like Syria than Caracas,\u201d one Nicaraguan business leader told me.\nBy December 322 people were dead and 565 imprisoned. Even professionals involved in the uprising (lawyers, engineering majors, radio broadcasters and merchants) had been reduced to lives of \"ever-changing safe houses, encrypted messaging apps and pseudonyms\", with the Ortega government allegedly \u201chunting us like deer,\u201d according to one dissident (Roberto Carlos Membre\u00f1o Brice\u00f1o). Human rights organization offices were raided, computers seized and observers expelled. Observers from the Organization of American States were expelled after releasing a critical investigative report of the government's response to the uprising. The report found the government had progressed from \"using tear gas to rubber bullets, then real bullets and finally military firepower like assault rifles and grenade launchers\", based on an analysis of videos posted on social media. At least 1,400 people involved in the uprising were hurt, although that the number was probably \"far higher because most people were too afraid to go to public hospitals, where doctors were fired for treating wounded protesters\". By July 2019 the international human rights organization Human Rights Watch called on the United States to impose sanctions on Ortega \"and other top\" Nicaraguan officials \"implicated\" in the crackdown on protests.\nForeign policy.\nSoon after the 2006 election, Ortega paid an official visit to Iran and met Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ortega told the press that the \"revolutions of Iran and Nicaragua are almost twin revolutions...since both revolutions are about justice, liberty, self-determination, and the struggle against imperialism.\" Since the start of his second presidency, various measures have been introduced to combat hunger and to improve access to healthcare, education, credit, and social security. In addition, other reforms have been carried out, including an enhancement of labour rights, the introduction of low-interest loans and training for female micro-entrepreneurs in rural areas, and the distribution of transport subsidies, scholarships, medicine, land titles, and housing materials throughout the population. Altogether, these policies have helped to reduce high levels of poverty and inequality in Nicaragua. Ortega placed the first lady, Rosario Murillo, in charge of the Citizens\u2019 Power Councils (CPCs), designed to implement his anti-poverty social policies. The CPCs also undermined municipal autonomy, as they effectively functioned as local governments by determining the distribution of public goods and services.\nOn March 6, 2008, following the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis, Ortega announced that Nicaragua was breaking diplomatic ties with Colombia \"in solidarity with the Ecuadorian people\". Ortega also stated, \"We are not breaking relations with the Colombian people. We are breaking relations with the terrorist policy practiced by \u00c1lvaro Uribe's government\". The relations were restored with the resolution at a Rio Group summit held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on March 7, 2008. At the summit Colombia's \u00c1lvaro Uribe, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Ortega publicly shook hands in a show of good-will. The handshakes, broadcast live throughout Latin America, appeared to signal that a week of military buildups and diplomatic repercussions was over. After the handshakes, Ortega said he would re-establish diplomatic ties with Colombia. Uribe then quipped that he would send him the bill for his ambassador's plane fare.\nOn May 25, 2008, Ortega, upon learning of the death of FARC guerrilla leader Manuel Marulanda in Colombia, expressed condolences to the family of Marulanda and solidarity with the FARC and called Marulanda an extraordinary fighter who battled against profound inequalities in Colombia. The declarations were protested by the Colombian government and criticized in the major Colombian media outlets.\nOn September 2, 2008, during ceremonies for the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Nicaraguan army, Ortega announced that \"Nicaragua recognizes the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and fully supports the Russian government's position\". Ortega's decision made Nicaragua the second country (after Russia) to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia. A day after Venezuela recognised the two Republics, Nicaragua established diplomatic relations with Abkhazia, and followed this by establishing diplomatic links with South Ossetia. Embassies have been mooted, but as of 2013 these had not opened.\nWhen seeking office, Ortega threatened to cut diplomatic recognition with the Republic of China (Taiwan, formerly Nationalist China) in order to restore relations with the Mainland-based People's Republic of China (as in the period from 1985 to 1990) as the legal government of China. But he did not do so. In 2007 Ortega stated that Nicaragua did not accept the One China Policy of the PRC government and that Nicaragua reserved the right to maintain official diplomatic relations with the ROC. He reassured President Chen Shui Bian in 2007 that Nicaragua would not break diplomatic relations with the ROC. He explained that during the Reagan administration the United States imposed sanctions on Nicaragua. But cutting ties with Taipei was a sad and painful decision because of the friendship between Nicaragua and Taiwan's people and government. Ortega met with the ROC President Ma Ying-jeou in 2009 and both agreed to improve the diplomatic ties between both countries. However, with a trade show from China (PRC) in Managua in 2010, he is attempting a two-track policy to get benefits from both sides. In 2016 Nicaragua and China (ROC) signed an air services agreement and Ortega stated that Nicaragua's free trade deal with the ROC had benefited both nations. The ROC increased its investment in Nicaragua. In 2017, Ortega reaffirmed Nicaragua's diplomatic relations with the Taipei government as the legal regime of China.\nIn September 2010, after a US report listed Nicaragua as a \"major\" drug-trafficking centre, with Costa Rica and Honduras, Ortega urged the US Congress and Obama administration to allocate more resources to assist the fight against drug trafficking.\nDuring the Libyan Civil War, Ortega was among the very few leaders who spoke out in clear defense of the embattled Muammar Gaddafi. During a telephone conversation between the two, Ortega told Gaddafi that he was \"waging a great battle to defend his nation\" and stated that \"it's at difficult times that loyalty and resolve are put to the test.\"\nOrtega has said that Assad's victory in the 2014 election is an important step to \"attain peace in Syria and a clear cut evidence that the Syrian people trust their president as a national leader and support his policies which aim at maintaining Syria's sovereignty and unity\".\nOrtega attended the swearing-in ceremony of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for his second term on January 10, 2019.\nIn an interview with Max Blumenthal in August 2019, Ortega stated that he was open to the idea of Bernie Sanders (who had visited him in 1985) winning the US presidency in 2020 and that Bernie's message \"goes in the right direction for the U.S. to become a pole of peace, development, and cooperation.\"\nEnvironmental policy.\nIn 2016, Daniel Ortega did not sign the Paris Agreement because he felt the deal did not do enough to protect the climate, although he later changed his mind. Moreover, Nicaragua rejected projects of mining of the Canadian group B2 Gold which could represent a threat to the environment. According to government estimates, Nicaragua has passed from 25% renewable electricity to 52% between 2007 and 2016.\nResponse to COVID-19.\nOn March 14th, 2020, Ortega's government called a massive demonstration called \"Love in the Time of COVID-19\" as a show of support to him and his government. This occurred in the middle of the COVID-19 Pandemic which had only recently been officially declared by the WHO. Although there were no known cases of the disease at the time, stunts like this and the government's general incompetence during the pandemic has received criticism from the opposition, denouncing Ortega and his allies as lacking any plan to address the pandemic.\nControversy.\nIn Nicaragua, reviews of Ortega's presidency have not always been glowing, with many considering him a dictator. Many Nicaraguans, including prominent former Sandinista leaders, such as Daniel Ortega's own brother Humberto Ortega, have accused him of forgetting where he came from and catering to his own capitalist interests, calling his government monopolistic and authoritarian and denouncing him as a \"Bloody Dictator\". The 2018 protests are symbolic of these tensions. As of 2018, the New York Times reports that the \"many Ortega adult children manage everything from gasoline distribution to television stations\" in Nicaragua.\nSexual abuse allegations.\nIn 1998, Daniel Ortega's adopted stepdaughter Zoilam\u00e9rica Narv\u00e1ez released a 48-page report describing how, she alleged, Ortega had systematically sexually abused her from 1979, when she was 12, until 1990. Ortega, his wife Murillo and their other children denied the allegations, as did many Sandinistas who believe it is politically motivated. The case could not proceed in Nicaraguan courts, which have been consistently allied with Ortega, because Ortega had immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament, and the five-year statute of limitations for sexual abuse and rape charges was judged to have been exceeded. Narv\u00e1ez took a complaint to the Inter American Human Rights Commission, which was ruled admissible on October 15, 2001. On March 4, 2002 the Nicaraguan government accepted the Commission's recommendation of a friendly settlement. \nOrtega continued to deny the allegations and Narv\u00e1ez withdrew the accusations in 2008, though she later renewed her complaints shortly after. Following the 2016 election, Narv\u00e1ez continued to make the accusations saying that she had become an outcast of her family."}
{"id": "8779", "revid": "187158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8779", "title": "Destroyer", "text": "In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers. They were originally developed in the late 19th century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats, and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these \"torpedo boat destroyers\" (TBDs) were \"large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats\". Although the term \"destroyer\" had been used interchangeably with \"TBD\" and \"torpedo boat destroyer\" by navies since 1892, the term \"torpedo boat destroyer\" had been generally shortened to simply \"destroyer\" by nearly all navies by the First World War.\nBefore World War II, destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together. After the war, the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers. This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation.\nAt the start of the 21st century, destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships, with only two nations (United States and Russia) officially operating the heavier class cruisers, with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining. Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era, and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. At long, a displacement of 9,200\u00a0tons, and with armament of more than 90 missiles, guided missile destroyers such as the are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers. The Chinese Type 055 destroyer has been described as a cruiser in some US Navy reports due to its size and armament.\nSome NATO navies, such as the Canadian, French, Spanish, Dutch and German, use the term \"frigate\" for their destroyers, which leads to some confusion.\nAfter the Second World War, destroyers grew in size. The Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer had a displacement of 2200 tons, while the Arleigh Burke class has a displacement of up to 9600 tons, thus growing in size almost 340%.\nOrigins.\nThe emergence and development of the destroyer was related to the invention of the self-propelled torpedo in the 1860s. A navy now had the potential to destroy a superior enemy battle fleet using steam launches to fire torpedoes. Cheap, fast boats armed with torpedoes called torpedo boats were built and became a threat to large capital ships near enemy coasts. The first seagoing vessel designed to launch the self-propelled Whitehead torpedo was the 33-ton in 1876. She was armed with two drop collars to launch these weapons, these were replaced in 1879 by a single torpedo tube in the bow. By the 1880s, the type had evolved into small ships of 50\u2013100 tons, fast enough to evade enemy picket boats.\nAt first, the threat of a torpedo boat attack to a battle fleet was considered to exist only when at anchor; but as faster and longer-range torpedo boats and torpedoes were developed, the threat extended to cruising at sea. In response to this new threat, more heavily gunned picket boats called \"catchers\" were built which were used to escort the battle fleet at sea. They needed significant seaworthiness and endurance to operate with the battle fleet, and as they necessarily became larger, they became officially designated \"torpedo boat destroyers\", and by the First World War were largely known as \"destroyers\" in English. The anti-torpedo boat origin of this type of ship is retained in its name in other languages, including French (), Italian (), Portuguese (), Czech (), Greek (, \"\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\"), Dutch () and, up until the Second World War, Polish (, now obsolete).\nOnce destroyers became more than just catchers guarding an anchorage, it was realized that they were also ideal to take over the offensive role of torpedo boats themselves, so they were also fitted with torpedo tubes in addition to their anti torpedo-boat guns. At that time, and even into World War I, the only function of destroyers was to protect their own battle fleet from enemy torpedo attacks and to make such attacks on the battleships of the enemy. The task of escorting merchant convoys was still in the future.\nEarly designs.\nAn important development came with the construction of HMS \"Swift\" in 1884, later redesignated TB 81. This was a large (137 ton) torpedo boat with four 47\u00a0mm quick-firing guns and three torpedo tubes. At , while still not fast enough to engage enemy torpedo boats reliably, the ship at least had the armament to deal with them.\nAnother forerunner of the torpedo boat destroyer was the Japanese torpedo boat (\"Falcon\"), built in 1885. Designed to Japanese specifications and ordered from the Isle of Dogs, London Yarrow shipyard in 1885, she was transported in parts to Japan, where she was assembled and launched in 1887. The long vessel was armed with four 1-pounder (37\u00a0mm) quick-firing guns and six torpedo tubes, reached , and at 203\u00a0tons, was the largest torpedo boat built to date. In her trials in 1889, \"Kotaka\" demonstrated that she could exceed the role of coastal defense, and was capable of accompanying larger warships on the high seas. The Yarrow shipyards, builder of the parts for \"Kotaka\", \"considered Japan to have effectively invented the destroyer\".\nThe German aviso , launched in 1886, was designed as a \"torpedoj\u00e4ger\" (torpedo hunter), intended to screen the fleet against attacks by torpedo boats. The ship was significantly larger than torpedo boats of the period, displacing some , with an armament of guns and Hotchkiss revolver cannon.\nTorpedo gunboat.\nThe first vessel designed for the explicit purpose of hunting and destroying torpedo boats was the torpedo gunboat. Essentially very small cruisers, torpedo gunboats were equipped with torpedo tubes and an adequate gun armament, intended for hunting down smaller enemy boats. By the end of the 1890s torpedo gunboats were made obsolete by their more successful contemporaries, the torpedo boat destroyers, which were much faster.\nThe first example of this was , designed by Nathaniel Barnaby in 1885, and commissioned in response to the Russian War scare. The gunboat was armed with torpedoes and designed for hunting and destroying smaller torpedo boats. Exactly long and in beam, she displaced 550 tons. Built of steel, \"Rattlesnake\" was un-armoured with the exception of a -inch protective deck. She was armed with a single 4-inch/25-pounder breech-loading gun, six 3-pounder QF guns and four torpedo tubes, arranged with two fixed tubes at the bow and a set of torpedo dropping carriages on either side. Four torpedo reloads were carried.\nA number of torpedo gunboat classes followed, including the \"Grasshopper\" class, the , the and the \u2013 all built for the Royal Navy during the 1880s and the 1890s.\nFernando Villaamil, second officer of the Ministry of the Navy of Spain, designed his own torpedo gunboat to combat the threat from the torpedo boat. He asked several British shipyards to submit proposals capable of fulfilling these specifications. In 1885 the Spanish Navy chose the design submitted by the shipyard of James and George Thomson of Clydebank. (\"Destroyer\" in Spanish) was laid down at the end of the year, launched in 1886, and commissioned in 1887. Some authors considered her as the first destroyer ever built.\nShe displaced 348 tons, and was the first warship equipped with twin triple-expansion engines generating , for a maximum speed of , which made her one of the faster ships in the world in 1888. She was armed with one Spanish-designed Hontoria breech-loading gun, four (6-pounder) Nordenfelt guns, two (3-pdr) Hotchkiss cannons and two Schwartzkopff torpedo tubes. The ship carried three torpedoes per tube. She was manned by a crew of 60.\nIn terms of gunnery, speed and dimensions, the specialised design to chase torpedo boats and her high seas capabilities, \"Destructor\" was an important precursor to the torpedo boat destroyer.\nDevelopment of the modern destroyer.\nThe first classes of ships to bear the formal designation \"torpedo boat destroyer\" (TBD) were the of two ships and of two ships of the Royal Navy.\nEarly torpedo gunboat designs lacked the range and speed to keep up with the fleet they were supposed to protect. In 1892, the Third Sea Lord, Rear Admiral John \"Jacky\" Fisher ordered the development of a new type of ships equipped with the then novel water-tube boilers and quick-firing small calibre guns. Six ships to the specifications circulated by the Admiralty were ordered initially, comprising three different designs each produced by a different shipbuilder: and from John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company, and from Yarrows, and and from Laird, Son &amp; Company.\nThese torpedo boat destroyers all featured a turtleback (i.e. rounded) forecastle that was characteristic of early British TBDs. and were both built by Thornycroft, displaced 260 tons (287.8 tons full load) and were 185 feet in length. They were armed with one 12-pounder gun and three 6-pounder guns, with one fixed 18-in torpedo tube in the bow plus two more torpedo tubes on a revolving mount abaft the two funnels. Later the bow torpedo tube was removed and two more 6-pounder guns added instead. They produced 4,200\u00a0hp from a pair of Thornycroft water-tube boilers, giving them a top speed of 27 knots, giving the range and speed to travel effectively with a battle fleet. In common with subsequent early Thornycroft boats, they had sloping sterns and double rudders.\nThe French navy, an extensive user of torpedo boats, built its first torpedo boat destroyer in 1899, with the 'torpilleur d'escadre'. The United States commissioned its first torpedo boat destroyer, , Destroyer No. 1, in 1902 and by 1906 there were 16 destroyers in service with the US Navy.\nSubsequent improvements.\nTorpedo boat destroyer designs continued to evolve around the turn of the 20th century in several key ways. The first was the introduction of the steam turbine. The spectacular unauthorized demonstration of the turbine powered \"Turbinia\" at the 1897 Spithead Navy Review, which, significantly, was of torpedo boat size, prompted the Royal Navy to order a prototype turbine powered destroyer, of 1899. This was the first turbine warship of any kind and achieved a remarkable on sea trials. By 1910 the turbine had been widely adopted by all navies for their faster ships.\nThe second development was the replacement of the torpedo-boat-style turtleback foredeck by a raised forecastle for the new s built in 1903, which provided better sea-keeping as well as more space below deck.\nThe first warship to use only fuel oil propulsion was the Royal Navy's torpedo boat destroyer , after experiments in 1904, although the obsolescence of coal as a fuel in British warships was delayed by its availability. Other navies also adopted oil, for instance the USN with the of 1909.\nIn spite of all this variety, destroyers adopted a largely similar pattern. The hull was long and narrow, with a relatively shallow draft. The bow was either raised in a forecastle or covered under a turtleback; underneath this were the crew spaces, extending to the way along the hull. Aft of the crew spaces was as much engine space as the technology of the time would allow: several boilers and engines or turbines. Above deck, one or more quick-firing guns were mounted in the bows, in front of the bridge; several more were mounted amidships and astern. Two tube mountings (later on, multiple mountings) were generally found amidships.\nBetween 1892 and 1914 destroyers became markedly larger: initially 275\u00a0tons with a length of for the Royal Navy's first of torpedo boat destroyers, up to the First World War with long destroyers displacing 1000\u00a0tons was not unusual. However, construction remained focused on putting the biggest possible engines into a small hull, resulting in a somewhat flimsy construction. Often hulls were built of high-tensile steel only 1/8\u00a0in thick.\nBy 1910 the steam-driven displacement (that is, not hydroplaning) torpedo boat had become redundant as a separate type. Germany nevertheless continued to build such boats until the end of World War I, although these were effectively small coastal destroyers. In fact Germany never distinguished between the two types, giving them pennant numbers in the same series and never giving names to destroyers. Ultimately the term \"torpedo boat\" came to be attached to a quite different vessel \u2013 the very fast hydroplaning motor driven MTB.\nEarly use and World War I.\nNavies originally built torpedo boat destroyers to protect against torpedo boats, but admirals soon appreciated the flexibility of the fast, multi-purpose vessels that resulted. Vice-Admiral Sir Baldwin Walker laid down destroyer duties for the Royal Navy:\nEarly destroyers were extremely cramped places to live, being \"without a doubt magnificent fighting vessels... but unable to stand bad weather\". During the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, the commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy torpedo boat destroyer \"Akatsuki\" described \"being in command of a destroyer for a long period, especially in wartime... is not very good for the health\". Stating that he had originally been strong and healthy, he continued, \"life on a destroyer in winter, with bad food, no comforts, would sap the powers of the strongest men in the long run. A \"destroyer\" is always more uncomfortable than the others, and rain, snow, and \"sea-water\" combine to make them damp; in fact, in bad weather there is not a dry spot where one can rest for a moment.\"\nThe Japanese destroyer-commander finished with, \"Yesterday I looked at myself in a mirror for a long time; I was disagreeably surprised to see my face thin, full of wrinkles, and as old as though I were fifty. My clothes (uniform) cover nothing but a skeleton, and my bones are full of rheumatism.\"\nIn 1898, the US Navy officially classified , a long all steel vessel displacing 165 tons, as a \"torpedo boat.\" However, her commander, LT. John C. Fremont, described her as \"...a compact mass of machinery not meant to keep the sea nor to live in... as five sevenths of the ship are taken up by machinery and fuel, whilst the remaining two sevenths, fore and aft, are the crew's quarters; officers forward and the men placed aft. And even in those spaces are placed anchor engines, steering engines, steam pipes, etc. rendering them unbearably hot in tropical regions.\"\nEarly combat.\nThe torpedo boat destroyer's first major use in combat came during the Japanese surprise attack on the Russian fleet anchored in Port Arthur at the opening of the Russo-Japanese War on 8 February 1904.\nThree destroyer divisions attacked the Russian fleet in port, firing a total of 18 torpedoes. However, only two Russian battleships, and , and a protected cruiser, , were seriously damaged due to the proper deployment of torpedo nets. \"Tsesarevich\", the Russian flagship, had her nets deployed, with at least four enemy torpedoes \"hung up\" in them, and other warships were similarly saved from further damage by their nets.\nWhile capital ship engagements were scarce in World War I, destroyer units engaged almost continually in raiding and patrol actions. The first shot of the war at sea was fired on 5 August 1914 by , one of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, in an engagement with the German auxiliary minelayer .\nDestroyers were involved in the skirmishes that prompted the Battle of Heligoland Bight, and filled a range of roles in the Battle of Gallipoli, acting as troop transports and as fire-support vessels, as well as their fleet-screening role. Over 80 British destroyers and 60 German torpedo-boats took part in the Battle of Jutland, which involved pitched small-boat actions between the main fleets, and several foolhardy attacks by unsupported destroyers on capital ships. Jutland also concluded with a messy night action between the German High Seas Fleet and part of the British destroyer screen.\nThe threat evolved by World War I with the development of the submarine, or U-boat. The submarine had the potential to hide from gunfire and close underwater to fire torpedoes. Early-war destroyers had the speed and armament to intercept submarines before they submerged, either by gunfire or by ramming. Destroyers also had a shallow enough draft that torpedoes would find it difficult to hit them.\nThe desire to attack submarines underwater led to rapid destroyer evolution during the war. They were quickly equipped with strengthened bows for ramming, and depth charges and hydrophones for identifying submarine targets. The first submarine casualty to a destroyer was the German , rammed by on 29 October 1914. While \"U-19\" was only damaged, the next month successfully sank . The first depth-charge sinking was on 4 December 1916, when was sunk by HMS \"Llewellyn\".\nThe submarine threat meant that many destroyers spent their time on anti-submarine patrol. Once Germany adopted unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917, destroyers were called on to escort merchant convoys. US Navy destroyers were among the first American units to be dispatched upon the American entry to the war, and a squadron of Japanese destroyers even joined Allied patrols in the Mediterranean. Patrol duty was far from safe; of the 67 British destroyers lost in the war, collisions accounted for 18, while 12 were wrecked.\nAt the end of the war, the state-of-the-art was represented by the British W class.\n1918\u20131945.\nThe trend during World War I had been towards larger destroyers with heavier armaments. A number of opportunities to fire at capital ships had been missed during the War, because destroyers had expended all their torpedoes in an initial salvo. The British V and W classes of the late war had sought to address this by mounting six torpedo tubes in two triple mounts, instead of the four or two on earlier models. The 'V' and 'W's set the standard of destroyer building well into the 1920s.\nThe two Romanian destroyers and , on the other hand, had the greatest firepower of all destroyers in the world throughout the first half of the 1920s. This was largely due to the fact that, between their commissioning in 1920 and 1926, they retained the armament that they had while serving in the Italian Navy as scout cruisers (\"esploratori\"). When initially ordered by Romania in 1913, the Romanian specifications envisioned three 120\u00a0mm guns, a caliber which would eventually be adopted as the standard for future Italian destroyers. Armed with three 152\u00a0mm and four 76\u00a0mm guns after being completed as scout cruisers, the two warships were officially re-rated as destroyers by the Romanian Navy. The two Romanian warships were thus the destroyers with the greatest firepower in the world throughout much of the interwar period. As of 1939, when the Second World War started, their artillery, although changed, was still close to cruiser standards, amounting to nine heavy naval guns (five of 120\u00a0mm and four of 76\u00a0mm). In addition, they retained their two twin 457\u00a0mm torpedo tubes as well as two machine guns, plus the capacity to carry up to 50 mines.\nThe next major innovation came with the Japanese or 'special type', designed in 1923 and delivered in 1928. The design was initially noted for its powerful armament of six five-inch (127\u00a0mm) guns and three triple torpedo mounts. The second batch of the class gave the guns high-angle turrets for anti-aircraft warfare, and the oxygen-fueled 'Long Lance' Type 93 torpedo. The later of 1931 further improved the torpedo armament by storing its reload torpedoes close at hand in the superstructure, allowing reloading within 15 minutes.\nMost other nations replied with similar larger ships. The US adopted twin five-inch (127\u00a0mm) guns, and the subsequent and es (the latter of 1934) increased the number of torpedo tubes to 12 and 16 respectively.\nIn the Mediterranean, the Italian Navy's building of very fast light cruisers of the prompted the French to produce exceptional destroyer designs. The French had long been keen on large destroyers, with their of 1922 displacing over 2,000\u00a0tons and carrying 130\u00a0mm guns; a further three similar classes were produced around 1930. The of 1935 carried five guns and nine torpedo tubes, but could achieve speeds of , which remains the record speed for a steamship and for any destroyer. The Italians' own destroyers were almost as swift, most Italian designs of the 1930s being rated at over , while carrying torpedoes and either four or six 120\u00a0mm guns.\nGermany started to build destroyers again during the 1930s as part of Hitler's rearmament program. The Germans were also fond of large destroyers, but while the initial Type 1934 displaced over 3,000\u00a0tons, their armament was equal to smaller vessels. This changed from the Type 1936 onwards, which mounted heavy guns. German destroyers also used innovative high-pressure steam machinery: while this should have helped their efficiency, it more often resulted in mechanical problems.\nOnce German and Japanese rearmament became clear, the British and American navies consciously focused on building destroyers that were smaller but more numerous than those used by other nations. The British built a series of destroyers (the to ) which were about 1,400\u00a0tons standard displacement, had four guns and eight torpedo tubes; the American of 1938 similar in size, but carried five guns and ten torpedo tubes. Realizing the need for heavier gun armament, the British built the of 1936 (sometimes called \"Afridi\" after one of two lead ships). These ships displaced 1,850\u00a0tons and were armed with eight guns in four twin turrets and four torpedo tubes. These were followed by the J-class and L-class destroyers, with six guns in twin turrets and eight torpedo tubes.\nAnti-submarine sensors included sonar (or ASDIC), although training in their use was indifferent. Anti-submarine weapons changed little, and ahead-throwing weapons, a need recognized in World War I, had made no progress.\nLater combat.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, destroyers were often deployed to areas of diplomatic tension or humanitarian disaster. British and American destroyers were common on the Chinese coast and rivers, even supplying landing parties to protect colonial interests.\nBy World War II the threat had evolved once again. Submarines were more effective, and aircraft had become important weapons of naval warfare; once again the early-war fleet destroyers were ill-equipped for combating these new targets. They were fitted with new light anti-aircraft guns, radar, and forward-launched ASW weapons, in addition to their existing dual-purpose guns, depth charges, and torpedoes. Increasing size allowed improved internal arrangement of propulsion machinery with compartmentation so ships were less likely to be sunk by a single hit. In most cases torpedo and/or dual-purpose gun armament was reduced to accommodate new anti-air and anti-submarine weapons. By this time the destroyers had become large, multi-purpose vessels, expensive targets in their own right. As a result, casualties on destroyers were among the highest.\nThe need for large numbers of anti-submarine ships led to the introduction of smaller and cheaper specialized anti-submarine warships called corvettes and frigates by the Royal Navy and destroyer escorts by the USN. A similar programme was belatedly started by the Japanese (see ). These ships had the size and displacement of the original torpedo boat destroyers that the contemporary destroyer had evolved from.\nPost-World War II.\nSome conventional destroyers were completed in the late 1940s and 1950s which built on wartime experience. These vessels were significantly larger than wartime ships and had fully automatic main guns, unit machinery, radar, sonar, and antisubmarine weapons such as the Squid mortar. Examples include the British , US , and the Soviet s.\nSome World War II\u2013vintage ships were modernized for anti-submarine warfare, and to extend their service lives, to avoid having to build (expensive) brand-new ships. Examples include the US FRAM I programme and the British Type 15 frigates converted from fleet destroyers.\nThe advent of surface-to-air missiles and surface-to-surface missiles, such as the Exocet, in the early 1960s changed naval warfare. Guided missile destroyers (DDG in the US Navy) were developed to carry these weapons and protect the fleet from air, submarine and surface threats. Examples include the Soviet , the British , and the US .\n21st century destroyers tend to display features such as large, slab sides without complicated corners and crevices to keep the radar cross-section small, vertical launch systems to carry a large number of missiles at high readiness to fire and helicopter flight decks and hangars.\nFuture development.\n is adding Type 052D destroyer and Type 055 destroyer class ships to its navy.\n is adding FREMM multipurpose frigates to their fleet.\n is currently building s. They are to replace the aging s. In addition, six multi-mission surface combat ships are planned under the name 'Mehrzweckkampfschiff 180' (MKS 180), which will have destroyer-size and corresponding capabilities (length: 163m, displacement: 10,400 tons)\n is constructing s, with first being commissioned in July 2021. It is an improved version of the \"Kolkata\"-class destroyers\n is currently adding s to its fleet. Iran is also building six s.\n is currently research development into their new DDX project to replace their \"Durand da le Penne\"-class destroyers.\n is currently developing plans for its 25DD destroyers and its DDR Destroyer Revolution Project. Japan is also planning the construction of four new AEGIS-equipped destroyers, whose class is yet to be named. Additionally, plans have been laid out for Japan's new 30FF anti-submarine destroyer. These ships are expected to enter service between 2018\u20132019.\n has begun development of its KDX-IIA destroyers. These ships are to be a subclass of South Korea's s. The first unit is expected to enter service in 2019. Additionally, s are being built.\n has begun development into its . The first unit is expected to enter service in 2023, with 11 more units to follow in the coming years. Additionally, Russia is also developing its s. \n is currently developing its TF2000-class destroyer as the largest part of the MILGEM project. A total of seven ships will be constructed and will specialise in anti-air warfare.\n is in the early stages of developing a Type 4X Destroyer (T4X) to replace its Type 45 Guided Missile Destroyers. Currently an Anti-Air Warfare variant of the upcoming Type 26 Frigate is being considered, which could see the Type 4X Destroyers entering service in the mid-2020's. \n, as of 2018, has 67 active \"Arleigh Burke\" destroyers and 15 planned or under construction. The new ships will be the upgraded \"flight III\" version.\nPreserved destroyers.\nA number of countries have destroyers preserved as museum ships. These include:"}

{"id": "8781", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8781", "title": "Dorothy Parker", "text": "Dorothy Parker (n\u00e9e Rothschild; August 22, 1893 \u2013 June 7, 1967) was an American poet, writer, critic, and satirist based in New York; she was best known for her wit, wisecracks, and eye for 20th-century urban foibles.\nFrom a conflicted and unhappy childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary works published in such magazines as \"The New Yorker\" and as a founding member of the Algonquin Round Table. Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting. Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in left-wing politics resulted in her being placed on the Hollywood blacklist.\nDismissive of her own talents, she deplored her reputation as a \"wisecracker.\" Nevertheless, both her literary output and reputation for sharp wit have endured. Some of her works have been set to music; adaptations notably include the operatic song cycle \"Hate Songs\" by composer Marcus Paus.\nEarly life and education.\nAlso known as Dot or Dottie, Parker was born Dorothy Rothschild in 1893 to Jacob Henry Rothschild and his wife Eliza Annie (n\u00e9e Marston) (1851\u20131898) at 732 Ocean Avenue in Long Branch, New Jersey. Her parents had a summer beach cottage there. Parker's mother was of Scottish descent. Her father was the son of Sampson Jacob Rothschild (1818\u20131899) and Mary Greissman (b. 1824), both Prussian-born Jews. Sampson Jacob Rothschild was a merchant who immigrated to the USA around 1846, settling in Monroe County, Alabama. Jacob Henry Rothschild was one of five known siblings. The others were: Simon (1854\u20131908); Samuel (b. 1857); Hannah (1860\u20131911), later Mrs. William Henry Theobald; and the youngest, Martin Rothschild, born in Manhattan on December 12, 1865, who perished in the sinking of the Titanic. Parker wrote in her essay, \"My Hometown,\" that her parents returned to their Manhattan apartment shortly after Labor Day so that she could be called a true New Yorker. Her mother died in Manhattan in July 1898, a month before Parker's fifth birthday.\nHer father remarried in 1900 to Eleanor Frances Lewis (1851\u20131903). Parker hated her father, who physically abused her, and her stepmother, whom she refused to call \"mother,\" \"stepmother,\" or \"Eleanor,\" instead referring to her as \"the housekeeper.\" However, her biographer, Marion Meade, refers to this account as \"largely false,\" stating that the atmosphere in which Parker was growing up was indulgent, affectionate, supportive and generous. Parker grew up on the Upper West Side and attended a Roman Catholic elementary school at the Convent of the Blessed Sacrament on West 79th Street with her sister, Helen, although their father was Jewish and her stepmother was Protestant. (Mercedes de Acosta was a classmate.) Parker once joked that she was asked to leave following her characterization of the Immaculate Conception as \"spontaneous combustion.\" Her stepmother died in 1903, when Parker was nine. Parker later attended Miss Dana's School, a finishing school in Morristown, New Jersey. She graduated from Miss Dana's School in 1911, at the age of 18, according to Authur, although Rhonda Pettit and Marion Meade state she never graduated from either school. Following her father's death in 1913, she played piano at a dancing school to earn a living while she worked on her poetry.\nShe sold her first poem to \"Vanity Fair\" magazine in 1914 and some months later was hired as an editorial assistant for \"Vogue\", another Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine. She moved to \"Vanity Fair\" as a staff writer after two years at \"Vogue.\"\nIn 1917, she met a Wall Street stockbroker, Edwin Pond Parker II\n(1893\u20131933) and they married before he left to serve in World War I with the U.S. Army 4th Division. Dorothy Parker filed for divorce in 1928. He later remarried, to Anne E. O\u2019Brien, formerly probation officer of the Juvenile Court, and died at 39, from an overdose of a sleeping powder for pain following a dental procedure. Dorothy Parker retained her married name, though she remarried the screenwriter and former actor Alan Campbell, and moved to Hollywood.\nAlgonquin Round Table years.\nParker's career took off in 1918 while she was writing theater criticism for \"Vanity Fair,\" filling in for the vacationing P. G. Wodehouse. At the magazine, she met Robert Benchley, who became a close friend, and Robert E. Sherwood. The trio began lunching at the Algonquin Hotel on a near-daily basis and became founding members of what became known as the Algonquin Round Table. The Round Table numbered among its members the newspaper columnists Franklin Pierce Adams and Alexander Woollcott. Through their publication of Parker's lunchtime remarks and short verses, particularly in Adams' column \"The Conning Tower\", Dorothy began developing a national reputation as a wit. When the group was informed that famously taciturn former president Calvin Coolidge had died, Parker remarked, \"How could they tell?\"\nParker's caustic wit as a critic initially proved popular, but she was eventually dismissed by \"Vanity Fair\" in 1920 after her criticisms too often offended powerful producers. In solidarity, Benchley resigned in protest. (Sherwood is sometimes reported to have done so as well, but in actuality he had been fired in December 1919.) She soon started working for \"Ainslee's Magazine\", which had a higher circulation. She also published pieces in \"Vanity Fair,\" which was happier to publish her than employ her, \"The Smart Set\", and \"The American Mercury\", but also in the popular \"Ladies\u2019 Home Journal\", \"Saturday Evening Post,\" and \"Life\".\nWhen Harold Ross founded \"The New Yorker\" in 1925, Parker and Benchley were part of a board of editors established by Ross to allay concerns of his investors. Parker's first piece for the magazine was published in its second issue. Parker became famous for her short, viciously humorous poems, many highlighting ludicrous aspects of her many (largely unsuccessful) romantic affairs and others wistfully considering the appeal of suicide.\nThe next 15 years were Parker's greatest period of productivity and success. In the 1920s alone she published some 300 poems and free verses in \"Vanity Fair,\" \"Vogue,\" \"The Conning Tower\" and \"The New Yorker\" as well as \"Life\", \"McCall's\" and \"The New Republic.\" Her poem, \"Song in a Minor Key\" was published during a candid interview with New York N.E.A. writer, Josephine Van de Grift.\nParker published her first volume of poetry, \"Enough Rope,\" in 1926. The collection sold 47,000 copies and garnered impressive reviews. \"The Nation\" described her verse as \"caked with a salty humor, rough with splinters of disillusion, and tarred with a bright black authenticity.\" Although some critics, notably \"The New York Times\" reviewer, dismissed her work as \"flapper verse,\" the volume helped affirm Parker's reputation for sparkling wit. Parker released two more volumes of verse, \"Sunset Gun\" (1928) and \"Death and Taxes\" (1931), along with the short story collections \"Laments for the Living\" (1930) and \"After Such Pleasures\" (1933). \"Not So Deep as a Well\" (1936) collected much of the material previously published in \"Rope,\" \"Gun,\" and \"Death\" and she re-released her fiction with a few new pieces in 1939 under the title \"Here Lies.\"\nShe collaborated with playwright Elmer Rice to create \"Close Harmony,\" which ran on Broadway in December 1924. The play was well received in out-of-town previews and was favorably reviewed in New York but it closed after a run of just 24 performances. It did become a successful touring production under the title \"The Lady Next Door,\"\nSome of Parker's most popular work was published in \"The New Yorker\" in the form of acerbic book reviews under the byline \"Constant Reader,\" Her response to the whimsy of A. A. Milne's \"The House at Pooh Corner\" was \"Tonstant Weader fwowed up\". Her reviews appeared semi-regularly from 1927 to 1933, were widely read, and were later published in a collection under the name \"Constant Reader\" in 1970.\nHer best-known short story, \"Big Blonde,\" published in \"The Bookman\" magazine, was awarded the O. Henry Award as the best short story of 1929. Her short stories, though often witty, were also spare and incisive, and more bittersweet than comic; her style is often described as sardonic.\nParker eventually separated from her husband, divorcing in 1928. She had a number of affairs, her lovers including reporter-turned-playwright Charles MacArthur and the publisher Seward Collins. Her relationship with MacArthur resulted in a pregnancy. Parker is alleged to have said, \"how like me, to put all my eggs into one bastard,\" She had an abortion, and fell into a depression that culminated in her first attempt at suicide.\nToward the end of this period, Parker began to become more politically aware and active. What would become a lifelong commitment to activism began in 1927 when she became concerned about the pending executions of Sacco and Vanzetti. Parker traveled to Boston to protest the proceedings. She and fellow Round Tabler Ruth Hale were arrested, and Parker eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of \"loitering and sauntering,\" paying a $5 fine.\nHollywood.\nIn 1932, Parker met Alan Campbell, an actor with aspirations to become a screenwriter. They married two years later in Raton, New Mexico. Campbell's mixed parentage was the reverse of Parker's: he had a German-Jewish mother and a Scottish father. She learned that he was bisexual and later proclaimed in public that he was \"queer as a billy goat\". The pair moved to Hollywood and signed ten-week contracts with Paramount Pictures, with Campbell (who was also expected to act) earning $250 per week and Parker earning $1,000 per week. They would eventually earn $2,000 and in some instances upwards of $5,000 per week as freelancers for various studios. She and Campbell worked on more than 15 films.\nIn 1935, Parker contributed lyrics for the song \"I Wished on the Moon,\" with music by Ralph Rainger. The song was introduced in \"The Big Broadcast of 1936\" by Bing Crosby.\nWith Campbell and Robert Carson, she wrote the script for the 1937 film \"A Star Is Born,\" for which they were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing\u2014Screenplay. She wrote additional dialogue for \"The Little Foxes\" in 1941. Together with Frank Cavett, she received a nomination for an Oscar for the screenplay of \"Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman\" (1947), starring Susan Hayward.\nAfter the United States entered the Second World War, Parker and Alexander Woollcott collaborated to produce an anthology of her work as part of a series published by Viking Press for servicemen stationed overseas. With an introduction by W. Somerset Maugham, the volume compiled over two dozen of Parker's short stories, along with selected poems from \"Enough Rope,\" \"Sunset Gun,\" and \"Death and Taxes,\" It was published in the United States in 1944 under the title \"The Portable Dorothy Parker.\" Hers is one of three \"Portable\" series, including volumes devoted to William Shakespeare and The Bible, that have remained in continuous print.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Parker became an increasingly vocal advocate of civil liberties and civil rights, and a frequent critic of authority figures. During the Great Depression, she was among numerous American intellectuals and artists who became involved in related social movements. She reported in 1937 on the Loyalist cause in Spain for the Communist magazine, 'The New Masses.' At the behest of Otto Katz, a covert Soviet Comintern agent and operative of German Communist Party agent Willi M\u00fcnzenberg, Parker helped to found the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in 1936, which the FBI suspected of being a Communist Party front. The Hollywood Anti-Nazi League's membership eventually grew to some 4,000 strong. According to David Caute, its often wealthy members were \"able to contribute as much to [Communist] Party funds as the whole American working class,\" although they may not have been intending to support the Party cause.\nParker also served as chair of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee's fundraising arm, \"Spanish Refugee Appeal\". She organized Project Rescue Ship to transport Loyalist veterans to Mexico, headed Spanish Children's Relief, and lent her name to many other left-wing causes and organizations. Her former Round Table friends saw less and less of her, and her relationship with Robert Benchley became particularly strained (although they would reconcile). Parker met S. J. Perelman at a party in 1932 and, despite a rocky start (Perelman called it \"a scarifying ordeal\"), they remained friends for the next 35 years. They became neighbors when the Perelmans helped Parker and Campbell buy a run-down farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, near New Hope, a popular summer destination among many writers and artists from New York.\nParker was listed as a Communist by the publication \"Red Channels\" in 1950. The FBI compiled a 1,000-page dossier on her because of her suspected involvement in Communism during the era when Senator Joseph McCarthy was raising alarms about communists in government and Hollywood. As a result, movie studio bosses placed her on the Hollywood blacklist. Her final screenplay was \"The Fan,\" a 1949 adaptation of Oscar Wilde's \"Lady Windermere's Fan\", directed by Otto Preminger.\nHer marriage to Campbell was tempestuous, with tensions exacerbated by Parker's increasing alcohol consumption and Campbell's long-term affair with a married woman in Europe during World War II. They divorced in 1947, remarried in 1950, then separated in 1952 when Parker moved back to New York. From 1957 to 1962, she lived at the Volney Residential Hotel on Manhattan's Upper East Side and wrote book reviews for \"Esquire magazine.\" Her writing became increasingly erratic due to her continued abuse of alcohol. She returned to Hollywood in 1961, reconciled with Campbell, and collaborated with him on a number of unproduced projects until Campbell died from a drug overdose in 1963.\nLater life and death.\nFollowing Campbell's death, Parker returned to New York City and the Volney Residential hotel. In her later years, she denigrated the Algonquin Round Table, although it had brought her such early notoriety:\nParker occasionally participated in radio programs, including \"Information Please\" (as a guest) and \"Author, Author\" (as a regular panelist). She wrote for the \"Columbia Workshop\", and both Ilka Chase and Tallulah Bankhead used her material for radio monologues.\nParker died on June 7, 1967, of a heart attack at the age of 73. In her will, she bequeathed her estate to Martin Luther King Jr., and upon King's death, to the NAACP.\nBurial.\nFollowing her cremation, Parker's ashes were unclaimed for several years. Finally, in 1973, the crematorium sent them to her lawyer's office; by then he had retired, and the ashes remained in the custody of his colleague Paul O'Dwyer's filing cabinet, for approximately 17 years. In 1988, O'Dwyer brought this situation to public attention, with the aid of celebrity columnist Liz Smith; after some discussion, the NAACP claimed Parker's remains and designed a memorial garden for them outside its Baltimore headquarters. The plaque read,\nIn early 2020, the NAACP moved its headquarters to downtown Baltimore and the question about what would happen to Parker's ashes became the topic of much speculation, especially after the NAACP formally announced it would later move to Washington, DC.\nThe NAACP restated that Parker's ashes will ultimately be where her family wishes her to be. \"It\u2019s important to us that we do this right,\u201d said the NAACP.\nRelatives called for the ashes to be moved back to the family's plot in Woodlawn Cemetery, in the Bronx, where a place had been reserved for Parker by her father. On August 18, 2020, Parker's urn was exhumed. \"Two executives from the N.A.A.C.P. spoke, and a rabbi who had attended her initial burial said Kaddish.\" On August 22, 2020, Parker was re-buried privately in Woodlawn, with the possibility of a more public ceremony later. \"Her legacy means a lot,\" added representatives from the NAACP.\nHonors.\nOn August 22, 1992, the 99th anniversary of Parker's birth, the United States Postal Service issued a 29\u00a2 U.S. commemorative postage stamp in the Literary Arts series. The Algonquin Round Table, as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged at the hotel, contributed to the Algonquin Hotel being designated in 1987 as a New York City Historic Landmark. In 1996, the hotel was designated as a National Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA, based on the contributions of Parker and other members of the Round Table. The organization's bronze plaque is attached to the front of the hotel. Parker's birthplace at the Jersey Shore was also designated a National Literary Landmark by Friends of Libraries USA in 2005 and a bronze plaque marks the former site of her family house.\nIn 2014, Parker was elected to the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\nIn popular culture.\nParker inspired a number of fictional characters in several plays of her day. These included \"Lily Malone\" in Philip Barry's \"Hotel Universe\" (1932), \"Mary Hilliard\" (played by Ruth Gordon) in George Oppenheimer's \"Here Today\" (1932), \"Paula Wharton\" in Gordon's 1944 play \"Over Twenty-one\" (directed by George S. Kaufman), and \"Julia Glenn\" in the Kaufman-Moss Hart collaboration \"Merrily We Roll Along\" (1934). Kaufman's representation of her in \"Merrily We Roll Along\" led Parker, once his Round Table compatriot, to despise him. She also was portrayed as \"Daisy Lester\" in Charles Brackett's 1934 novel \"Entirely Surrounded\". She is mentioned in the original introductory lyrics in Cole Porter's song \"Just One of Those Things\" from the 1935 Broadway musical \"Jubilee\", which have been retained in the standard interpretation of the song as part of the Great American Songbook.\nParker is featured as a character in the novel \"The Dorothy Parker Murder Case\" by George Baxt (1984), in a series of \"Algonquin Round Table Mysteries\" by J.J. Murphy (2011\u2013 ), and in Ellen Meister's novel \"Farewell, Dorothy Parker\" (2013). She is the main character in \"Love For Miss Dottie\", a short story by Larry N Mayer, which was selected by writer Mary Gaitskill for the collection \"Best New American Voices 2009\" (Harcourt).\nShe has been portrayed on film and television by Dolores Sutton in \"F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood\" (1976), Rosemary Murphy in \"Julia\" (1977), Bebe Neuwirth in \"Dash and Lilly\" (1999), and Jennifer Jason Leigh in \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle\" (1994). Neuwirth was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance, and Leigh received a number of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe nomination.\nTelevision creator Amy Sherman-Palladino named her production company 'Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions' in tribute to Parker.\nTucson actress Lesley Abrams wrote and performed the one-woman show \"Dorothy Parker's Last Call\" in 2009 in Tucson, Arizona at the Winding Road Theater Ensemble. She reprised the role at the Live Theatre Workshop in Tucson in 2014. The play was selected to be part of the Capital Fringe Festival in DC in 2010.\nIn 2018, American drag queen Miz Cracker played Parker in the celebrity-impersonation game show episode of the Season 10 of \"Rupaul's Drag Race\".\nIn the 2018 film \"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\" (based on the 2008 memoir of the same name), Melissa McCarthy plays Lee Israel, an author who for a time forged original letters in Dorothy Parker's name.\nAdaptations.\nIn the 2010s some of her poems from the early 20th century have been set to music by the composer Marcus Paus as the operatic song cycle \"Hate Songs for Mezzo-Soprano and Orchestra\" (2014); Paus' \"Hate Songs\" was included on Tora Augestad's and the Oslo Philharmonic's album \"Portraying Passion: Works by Weill/Paus/Ives\" (2018) with works by Paus, Kurt Weill and Charles Ives. It was described by musicologist Ralph P. Locke as \"one of the most engaging works\" in recent years; \"the cycle expresses Parker's favorite theme: how awful human beings are, especially the male of the species.\"\nIn 2014, lyrics taken from her book of poetry \"Not So Deep as a Well\" were, with the authorization of the NAACP, used by Canadian singer Myriam Gendron to create a folk album of the same name. Also in 2014, Chicago jazz bassist/singer/composer Katie Ernst issued her album \"Little Words\", consisting of her authorized settings of seven of Parker's poems."}
{"id": "8783", "revid": "5519174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8783", "title": "Dylan Thomas", "text": "Dylan Marlais Thomas (27 October 1914\u00a0\u2013 9 November 1953) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" and \"And death shall have no dominion\"; the \"play for voices\" \"Under Milk Wood\"; and stories and radio broadcasts such as \"A Child's Christmas in Wales\" and \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog\". He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a \"roistering, drunken and doomed poet\".\nThomas was born in Swansea, Wales, in 1914. In 1931, when he was 16, Thomas, an undistinguished pupil, left school to become a reporter for the \"South Wales Daily Post\", only to leave under pressure 18 months later. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager. In 1934, the publication of \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara. They married in 1937. In 1938, they settled in Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, and brought up their three children.\nThomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer was difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene.\nThomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in the United States cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to vinyl such works as \"A Child's Christmas in Wales\". During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma. He died on 9 November 1953 and his body was returned to Wales. On 25 November 1953, he was interred at St Martin's churchyard in Laugharne.\nAlthough Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.\nLife and career.\nEarly time.\nDylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in Swansea, the son of Florence Hannah (\"n\u00e9e\" Williams; 1882\u20131958), a seamstress, and David John Thomas (1876\u20131952), a teacher. His father had a first-class honours degree in English from University College, Aberystwyth and ambitions to rise above his position teaching English literature at the local grammar school. Thomas had one sibling, Nancy Marles (1906\u20131953), who was eight years his senior. The children spoke only English, though their parents were bilingual in English and Welsh, and David Thomas gave Welsh lessons at home. Thomas's father chose the name Dylan, which could be translated as \"son of the sea\", after Dylan ail Don, a character in \"The Mabinogion\". His middle name, Marlais, was given in honour of his great-uncle, William Thomas, a Unitarian minister and poet whose bardic name was Gwilym Marles. Dylan, pronounced [\u02c8d\u0259lan] (Dull-an) in Welsh, caused his mother to worry that he might be teased as the \"dull one\". When he broadcast on Welsh BBC, early in his career, he was introduced using this pronunciation. Thomas favoured the Anglicised pronunciation and gave instructions that it should be Dillan .\nThe red-brick semi-detached house at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive (in the respectable area of the Uplands), in which Thomas was born and lived until he was 23, had been bought by his parents a few months before his birth. His childhood featured regular summer trips to Llansteffan where his maternal relatives were the sixth generation to farm there. His mother's family, the Williamses, lived in such farms as Waunfwlchan, Llwyngwyn, Maesgwyn and Penycoed. The memory of Fernhill, a dairy farm owned by his maternal aunt, Ann Jones, is evoked in the 1945 lyrical poem \"Fern Hill\". Thomas had bronchitis and asthma in childhood and struggled with these throughout his life. Thomas was indulged by his mother and enjoyed being mollycoddled, a trait he carried into adulthood, and he was skilful in gaining attention and sympathy. Thomas' formal education began at Mrs Hole's dame school, a private school on Mirador Crescent, a few streets away from his home. He described his experience there in \"Quite Early One Morning\":\nNever was there such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons drifting down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums, or to repent a little crime\u00a0\u2013 the pulling of a girl's hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.\nIn October 1925, Thomas enrolled at Swansea Grammar School for boys, in Mount Pleasant, where his father taught English. He was an undistinguished pupil who shied away from school, preferring reading. In his first year one of his poems was published in the school's magazine, and before he left he became its editor. During his final school years he began writing poetry in notebooks; the first poem, dated 27 April (1930), is entitled \"Osiris, come to Isis\". In June 1928 Thomas won the school's mile race, held at St. Helen's Ground; he carried a newspaper photograph of his victory with him until his death. In 1931, when he was 16, Thomas left school to become a reporter for the \"South Wales Daily Post\", only to leave under pressure 18 months later. Thomas continued to work as a freelance journalist for several years, during which time he remained at Cwmdonkin Drive and continued to add to his notebooks, amassing 200 poems in four books between 1930 and 1934. Of the 90 poems he published, half were written during these years.\nIn his free time, he joined the amateur dramatic group at the Little Theatre in Mumbles, visited the cinema in Uplands, took walks along Swansea Bay, and frequented Swansea's pubs, especially the Antelope and the Mermaid Hotels in Mumbles. In the Kardomah Caf\u00e9, close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet Vernon Watkins. The group of writers, musicians and artists became known as \"The Kardomah Gang\". In 1933, Thomas visited London for probably the first time.\n1933\u20131939.\nThomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: \"And death shall have no dominion\", \"Before I Knocked\" and \"The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower\". \"And death shall have no dominion\" appeared in the \"New English Weekly\" in May 1933. When \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" appeared in \"The Listener\" in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, T. S. Eliot, Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender. They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, \"18 Poems\", was published in December 1934. \"18 Poems\" was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was \"the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years\". The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the \"Sunday Referee\", netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir. The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves. A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin. In September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas did not know how to do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him. Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him. In December 1935 Thomas contributed the poem \"The Hand That Signed the Paper\" to Issue 18 of the bi-monthly \"New Verse\". In 1936, his next collection \"Twenty-five Poems\", published by J. M. Dent, also received much critical praise. In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London. It was the time that Thomas's reputation for heavy drinking developed.\nIn early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913\u201394), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish and French descent. She had run away from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, and in the second half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.\nBy the late 1930s, Thomas was embraced as the \"poetic herald\" for a group of English poets, the New Apocalyptics. Thomas refused to align himself with them and declined to sign their manifesto. He later stated that he believed they were \"intellectual muckpots leaning on a theory\". Despite this, many of the group, including Henry Treece, modelled their work on Thomas's.\nDuring the politically charged atmosphere of the 1930s, Thomas's sympathies were very much with the radical left, to the point of holding close links with the communists, as well as decidedly pacifist and anti-fascist. He was a supporter of the left-wing No More War Movement and boasted about participating in demonstrations against the British Union of Fascists.\nWartime, 1939\u20131945.\nIn 1939, a collection of 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934, appeared as \"The Map of Love\". Ten stories in his next book, \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog\" (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than those in \"The Map of Love\" and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire \"The Death of the King's Canary\", though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.\nAt the outset of the Second World War, Thomas was worried about conscription, and referred to his ailment as \"an unreliable lung\". Coughing sometimes confined him to bed, and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus. After initially seeking employment in a reserved occupation, he managed to be classified Grade III, which meant that he would be among the last to be called up for service. Saddened to see his friends going on active service, he continued drinking and struggled to support his family. He wrote begging letters to random literary figures asking for support, a plan he hoped would provide a long-term regular income. Thomas supplemented his income by writing scripts for the BBC, which not only gave him additional earnings but also provided evidence that he was engaged in essential war work.\nIn February 1941, Swansea was bombed by the Luftwaffe in a \"three nights' blitz\". Castle Street was one of many streets that suffered badly; rows of shops, including the Kardomah Caf\u00e9, were destroyed. Thomas walked through the bombed-out shell of the town centre with his friend Bert Trick. Upset at the sight, he concluded: \"Our Swansea is dead\". Soon after the bombing raids, Thomas wrote a radio play, \"Return Journey Home\", which described the caf\u00e9 as being \"razed to the snow\". The play was first broadcast on 15 June 1947. The Kardomah Caf\u00e9 reopened on Portland Street after the war.\nIn five film projects, between 1942 and 1945, the Ministry of Information commissioned Thomas to script a series of documentaries about both urban planning and wartime patriotism, all in partnership with director John Eldridge: \"\", \"New Towns for Old\", \"Fuel for Battle\", \"Our Country\" and \"A City Reborn.\"\nIn May 1941, Thomas and Caitlin left their son with his grandmother at Blashford and moved to London. Thomas hoped to find employment in the film industry and wrote to the director of the films division of the Ministry of Information (MOI). After being rebuffed, he found work with Strand Films, providing him with his first regular income since the \"Daily Post\". Strand produced films for the MOI; Thomas scripted at least five films in 1942, \"This Is Colour\" (a history of the British dyeing industry) and \"New Towns For Old\" (on post-war reconstruction). \"These Are The Men\" (1943) was a more ambitious piece in which Thomas's verse accompanies Leni Riefenstahl's footage of an early Nuremberg Rally. \"Conquest of a Germ\" (1944) explored the use of early antibiotics in the fight against pneumonia and tuberculosis. \"Our Country\" (1945) was a romantic tour of Britain set to Thomas's poetry.\nIn early 1943, Thomas began a relationship with Pamela Glendower; one of several affairs he had during his marriage. The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity. In March 1943 Caitlin gave birth to a daughter, Aeronwy, in London. They lived in a run-down studio in Chelsea, made up of a single large room with a curtain to separate the kitchen.\nIn 1944, with the threat of German flying bombs on London, Thomas moved to the family cottage at Blaen Cwm near Llangain, where Thomas resumed writing poetry, completing \"Holy Spring\" and \"Vision and Prayer\". In September Thomas and Caitlin moved to New Quay in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), which inspired Thomas to pen the radio piece \"Quite Early One Morning\", a sketch for his later work, \"Under Milk Wood\". Of the poetry written at this time, of note is \"Fern Hill\", believed to have been started while living in New Quay, but completed at Blaen Cwm in mid-1945.\nBroadcasting years 1945\u20131949.\nAlthough Thomas had previously written for the BBC, it was a minor and intermittent source of income. In 1943 he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk entitled \"Reminiscences of Childhood\" for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944 he recorded \"Quite Early One Morning\" (produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies, again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down. On 31 August 1945 the BBC Home Service broadcast \"Quite Early One Morning\", and in the three years beginning October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation. Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.\nBy late September 1945, the Thomases had left Wales and were living with various friends in London. The publication of \"Deaths and Entrances\" in 1946 was a turning point for Thomas. Poet and critic Walter J. Turner commented in \"The Spectator\", \"This book alone, in my opinion, ranks him as a major poet\".\nIn the second half of 1945, Thomas began reading for the BBC Radio programme, \"Book of Verse\", broadcast weekly to the Far East. This provided Thomas with a regular income and brought him into contact with Louis MacNeice, a congenial drinking companion whose advice Thomas cherished. On 29 September 1946, the BBC began transmitting the \"Third Programme\", a high-culture network which provided opportunities for Thomas. He appeared in the play \"Comus\" for the Third Programme, the day after the network launched, and his rich, sonorous voice led to character parts, including the lead in Aeschylus' \"Agamemnon\" and Satan in an adaptation of \"Paradise Lost\". Thomas remained a popular guest on radio talk shows for the BBC, who regarded him as \"useful should a younger generation poet be needed\". He had an uneasy relationship with BBC management and a staff job was never an option, with drinking cited as the problem. Despite this, Thomas became a familiar radio voice and within Britain was \"in every sense a celebrity\".\nThomas visited the home of historian A. J. P. Taylor in Disley. Although Taylor disliked him intensely, he stayed for a month, drinking \"on a monumental scale\", up to 15 or 20 pints of beer a day. In late 1946 Thomas turned up at the Taylors' again, this time homeless and with Caitlin. Margaret Taylor let them take up residence in the garden summerhouse. After a three-month holiday in Italy, Thomas and family moved, in September 1947, into the Manor House in South Leigh, just west of Oxford. He continued with his work for the BBC, completed a number of film scripts and worked further on his ideas for \"Under Milk Wood\". In May 1949 Thomas and his family moved to his final home, the Boat House at Laugharne, purchased for him at a cost of \u00a32,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor. Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems. Just before moving into there, Thomas rented \"Pelican House\" opposite his regular drinking den, Brown's Hotel, for his parents who lived there from 1949 until 1953. It was there that his father died and the funeral was held.\nCaitlin gave birth to their third child, a boy named Colm Garan Hart, on 25 July 1949.\nAmerican tours, 1950\u20131953.\nAmerican poet John Brinnin invited Thomas to New York, where in 1950 they embarked on a lucrative three-month tour of arts centres and campuses. The tour, which began in front of an audience of a thousand at the Kaufmann Auditorium of the Poetry Centre in New York, took in about 40 venues. During the tour Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk \u2013 going out of his way to shock people \u2013 and was a difficult guest. Thomas drank before some of his readings, though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was. The writer Elizabeth Hardwick recalled how intoxicating a performer he was and how the tension would build before a performance: \"Would he arrive only to break down on the stage? Would some dismaying scene take place at the faculty party? Would he be offensive, violent, obscene?\" Caitlin said in her memoir, \"Nobody ever needed encouragement less, and he was drowned in it.\"\nOn returning to Britain Thomas began work on two further poems, \"In the white giant's thigh\", which he read on the \"Third Programme\" in September 1950, and the incomplete \"In country heaven\". 1950 is also believed to be the year that he began work on \"Under Milk Wood\", under the working title 'The Town That Was Mad'. The task of seeing this work through to production was assigned to the BBC's Douglas Cleverdon, who had been responsible for casting Thomas in 'Paradise Lost'. Despite Cleverdon's urges, the script slipped from Thomas's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to Iran to work on a film for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The film was never made, with Thomas returning to Wales in February, though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary entitled 'Persian Oil'. Early that year Thomas wrote two poems, which Thomas's principal biographer, Paul Ferris describes as \"unusually blunt\"; the ribald \"Lament\" and an ode, in the form of a villanelle, to his dying father \"Do not go gentle into that good night\".\nDespite a range of wealthy patrons, including Margaret Taylor, Princess Marguerite Caetani and Marged Howard-Stepney, Thomas was still in financial difficulty, and he wrote several begging letters to notable literary figures including the likes of T. S. Eliot. Taylor was not keen on Thomas taking another trip to the United States, and thought that if Thomas had a permanent address in London he would be able to gain steady work there. She bought a property, 54 Delancey Street, in Camden Town, and in late 1951 Thomas and Caitlin lived in the basement flat. Thomas would describe the flat as his \"London house of horror\" and did not return there after his 1952 tour of America.\nThomas undertook a second tour of the United States in 1952, this time with Caitlin \u2013 after she had discovered he had been unfaithful on his earlier trip. They drank heavily, and Thomas began to suffer with gout and lung problems. The second tour was the most intensive of the four, taking in 46 engagements. The trip also resulted in Thomas recording his first poetry to vinyl, which Caedmon Records released in America later that year. One of his works recorded during this time, \"A Child's Christmas in Wales\", became his most popular prose work in America. The original 1952 recording of \"A Child's Christmas in Wales\" was a 2008 selection for the United States National Recording Registry, stating that it is \"credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States\".\nIn April 1953 Thomas returned alone for a third tour of America. He performed a \"work in progress\" version of \"Under Milk Wood\", solo, for the first time at Harvard University on 3 May. A week later the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York. He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin's assistant, Liz Reitell, and was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance; its last lines were handed to the actors as they put on their makeup.\nDuring this penultimate tour Thomas met the composer Igor Stravinsky who had become an admirer after having been introduced to his poetry by W. H. Auden. They had discussions about collaborating on a \"musical theatrical work\" for which Thomas would provide the libretto on the theme of \"the rediscovery of love and language in what might be left after the world after the bomb.\" The shock of Thomas's death later in the year moved Stravinsky to compose his \"In Memoriam Dylan Thomas\" for tenor, string quartet, and four trombones. The first performance in Los Angeles in 1954 was introduced with a tribute to Thomas from Aldous Huxley.\nThomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell, with whom he had an affair. During this time Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk. Reitell's doctor, Milton Feltenstein, put his arm in plaster and treated him for gout and gastritis.\nAfter returning home, Thomas worked on \"Under Milk Wood\" in Wales before sending the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953. It was copied and returned to Thomas, who lost it in a pub in London and required a duplicate to take to America. Thomas flew to the States on 19 October 1953 for what would be his final tour. He died in New York before the BBC could record \"Under Milk Wood\". Richard Burton starred in the first broadcast in 1954, and was joined by Elizabeth Taylor in a subsequent film. In 1954 the play won the Prix Italia for literary or dramatic programmes.\nThomas's last collection \"Collected Poems, 1934\u20131952\", published when he was 38, won the Foyle poetry prize. Reviewing the volume, critic Philip Toynbee declared that \"Thomas is the greatest living poet in the English language\". Thomas's father died from pneumonia just before Christmas 1952. In the first few months of 1953 his sister died from liver cancer, one of his patrons took an overdose of sleeping pills, three friends died at an early age and Caitlin had an abortion.\nDeath.\nThomas arrived in New York on 20 October 1953 to undertake another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by John Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout while still in Britain, there is no record that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox vaccination certificate.\nPlans called for a first appearance at a rehearsal of \"Under Milk Wood\" at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who was director of the Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas for the first time since their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance, as he looked \"pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self\". Thomas told her he had had a terrible week, had missed her terribly and wanted to go to bed with her. Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of \"Under Milk Wood\". They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.\nThe next day Reitell invited him to her apartment, but he declined. They went sightseeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed for the rest of the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of phenobarbitone to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, Herb Hannum, a friend from an earlier trip, noticed how sick Thomas looked and suggested an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of \"Under Milk Wood\" that evening. Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances, but collapsed immediately afterwards. Reitell later said that Feltenstein was \"rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything\".\nOn the evening of 27 October Thomas attended his 39th birthday party but felt unwell and returned to his hotel after an hour. The next day he took part in \"Poetry and the Film\", a recorded symposium at Cinema 16, with panellists Amos Vogel, Arthur Miller, Maya Deren, Parker Tyler, and Willard Maas.\nA turning point came on 2 November. Air pollution in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By the end of the month over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog. On 3\u00a0November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel he went out again for a drink at 2\u00a0am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, \"I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!\" The barman and the owner of the pub who served him later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount. Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the cortisone secretant ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11\u00a0pm. At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue. An ambulance was summoned.\nThomas was admitted to the emergency ward at St Vincent's Hospital at 1:58\u00a0am. He was comatose, and his medical notes state that \"the impression upon admission was acute alcoholic encephalopathy damage to the brain by alcohol, for which the patient was treated without response\". Caitlin flew to America the following day and was taken to the hospital, by which time a tracheotomy had been performed. Her reported first words were, \"Is the bloody man dead yet?\" She was allowed to see Thomas only for 40 minutes in the morning but returned in the afternoon and, in a drunken rage, threatened to kill John Brinnin. When she became uncontrollable, she was put in a straitjacket and committed, by Feltenstein, to the River Crest private psychiatric detox clinic on Long Island.\nIt is also now believed, however, that Thomas had been suffering from bronchitis and pneumonia, as well as emphysema, immediately before his death. In their 2004 book \"Dylan Remembered 1935\u20131953, Volume 2\", David N. Thomas and Dr Simon Barton disclose that Thomas was found to have pneumonia when he was admitted to hospital in a coma. Doctors took three hours to restore his breathing, using artificial respiration and oxygen. Summarising their findings, they conclude: \"The medical notes indicate that, on admission, Dylan's bronchial disease was found to be very extensive, affecting upper, mid and lower lung fields, both left and right.\" Thomas died at noon on 9\u00a0November, having never recovered from his coma.\nAftermath.\nRumours circulated of a brain haemorrhage, followed by competing reports of a mugging or even that Thomas had drunk himself to death. Later, speculation arose about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death\u00a0\u2013 pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite the poet's heavy drinking, his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.\nThe publication of John Brinnin's 1955 biography \"Dylan Thomas in America\" cemented Thomas's legacy as the \"doomed poet\"; Brinnin focuses on Thomas's last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer. Later biographies have criticised Brinnin's view, especially his coverage of Thomas's death. David Thomas in \"Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas?\" claims that Brinnin, along with Reitell and Feltenstein, were culpable. FitzGibbon's 1965 biography ignores Thomas's heavy drinking and skims over his death, giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas's demise. Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas's heavy drinking, but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death. Many sources have criticised Feltenstein's role and actions, especially his incorrect diagnosis of delirium tremens and the high dose of morphine he administered. Dr C. G. de Gutierrez-Mahoney, the doctor who treated Thomas while at St. Vincents, concluded that Feltenstein's failure to see that Thomas was gravely ill and have him admitted to hospital sooner \"was even more culpable than his use of morphine\".\nCaitlin Thomas's autobiographies, \"Caitlin Thomas\u00a0\u2013 Leftover Life to Kill\" (1957) and \"My Life with Dylan Thomas: Double Drink Story\" (1997), describe the effects of alcohol on the poet and on their relationship. \"Ours was not only a love story, it was a drink story, because without alcohol it would never had got on its rocking feet\", she wrote, and \"The bar was our altar.\" Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the decline in Thomas's health to an alcoholic co-dependent relationship with his wife, who deeply resented his extramarital affairs. In contrast, Dylan biographers Andrew Sinclair and George Tremlett express the view that Thomas was not an alcoholic. Tremlett argues that many of Thomas's health issues stemmed from undiagnosed diabetes.\nThomas died intestate, with assets to the value of \u00a3100. His body was brought back to Wales for burial in the village churchyard at Laugharne. Thomas's funeral, which Brinnin did not attend, took place at St Martin's Church in Laugharne on 24 November. Six friends from the village carried Thomas's coffin. Caitlin, without her customary hat, walked behind the coffin, with his childhood friend Daniel Jones at her arm and her mother by her side. The procession to the church was filmed and the wake took place at Brown's Hotel. Thomas's fellow poet and long-time friend Vernon Watkins wrote \"The Times\" obituary.\nThomas's widow, Caitlin, died in 1994 and was buried alongside him. Thomas's father \"DJ\" died on 16 December 1952 and his mother Florence in August 1958. Thomas's elder son, Llewelyn, died in 2000, his daughter, Aeronwy in 2009 and his youngest son Colm in 2012.\nPoetry.\nPoetic style and influences.\nThomas's refusal to align with any literary group or movement has made him and his work difficult to categorise.\nAlthough influenced by the modern symbolism and surrealism movements he refused to follow such creeds. Instead, critics view Thomas as part of the modernism and romanticism movements,\nthough attempts to pigeon-hole him within a particular neo-romantic school have been unsuccessful. Elder Olson, in his 1954 critical study of Thomas's poetry, wrote of \"...\u00a0a further characteristic which distinguished Thomas's work from that of other poets. It was unclassifiable.\"\nOlson continued that in a postmodern age that continually attempted to demand that poetry have social reference, none could be found in Thomas's work, and that his work was so obscure that critics could not explicate it.\nThomas's verbal style played against strict verse forms, such as in the villanelle \"Do not go gentle into that good night\". His images appear carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, Welsh folklore, preaching, and Sigmund Freud. Explaining the source of his imagery, Thomas wrote in a letter to Glyn Jones: \"My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I'm afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy\".\nThomas's early poetry was noted for its verbal density, alliteration, sprung rhythm and internal rhyme, and some critics detected the influence of the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. This is attributed to Hopkins, who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse, bringing some features of Welsh poetic metre into his work. When Henry Treece wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas wrote back denying any such influence. Thomas greatly admired Thomas Hardy, who is regarded as an influence. When Thomas travelled in America, he recited some of Hardy's work in his readings.\nOther poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include James Joyce, Arthur Rimbaud and D. H. Lawrence. William York Tindall, in his 1962 study, \"A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas\", finds comparison between Thomas's and Joyce's wordplay, while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas. Although Thomas described himself as the \"Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive\", he stated that the phrase \"Swansea's Rimbaud\" was coined by poet Roy Campbell. Critics have explored the origins of Thomas's mythological pasts in his works such as \"The Orchards\", which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the \"Mabinogion\".\nThomas's poetry is notable for its musicality, most clear in \"Fern Hill\", \"In Country Sleep\", \"Ballad of the Long-legged Bait\" and \"In the White Giant's Thigh\" from \"Under Milk Wood\".\nThomas once confided that the poems which had most influenced him were \"Mother Goose\" rhymes which his parents taught him when he was a child:\nI should say I wanted to write poetry in the beginning because I had fallen in love with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance\u00a0... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.\nThomas became an accomplished writer of prose poetry, with collections such as \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog\" (1940) and \"Quite Early One Morning\" (1954) showing he was capable of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work, \"After the Fair\", appeared in \"The New English Weekly\" on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that one can classify Thomas's fiction work into two main bodies: vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives.\nKorg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.\nWelsh poet.\nThomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry. When he wrote to Stephen Spender in 1952, thanking him for a review of his \"Collected Poems\", he added \"Oh, &amp; I forgot. I'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can't read Welsh.\" Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that \"His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background\". Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked \"in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings. The groove of direct hereditary descent in the land of his birth, which he never in thought, and hardly in body, moved out of.\"\nHead of Programmes Wales at the BBC, Aneirin Talfan Davies, who commissioned several of Thomas's early radio talks, believed that the poet's \"whole attitude is that of the medieval bards.\" Kenneth O. Morgan counter-argues that it is a 'difficult enterprise' to find traces of \"cynghanedd\" (consonant harmony) or \"cerdd dafod\" (tongue-craft) in Thomas's poetry. Instead he believes his work, especially his earlier more autobiographical poems, are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the Anglicisation of the new industrial nation: \"rural and urban, chapel-going and profane, Welsh and English, Unforgiving and deeply compassionate.\" Fellow poet and critic Glyn Jones believed that any traces of \"cynghanedd\" in Thomas's work were accidental, although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics; that of counting syllables per line instead of feet. Constantine Fitzgibbon,who was his first in-depth biographer, wrote \"No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan\".\nAlthough Thomas had a deep connection with Wales, he disliked Welsh nationalism. He once wrote, \"Land of my fathers, and my fathers can keep it\". While often attributed to Thomas himself, this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan-Vaughan, in the screenplay Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama \"The Three Weird Sisters\". Robert Pocock, a friend from the BBC, recalled \"I only once heard Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism. He used three words. Two of them were Welsh Nationalism.\" Although not expressed as strongly, Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas's friendship cooled in the later years as he had not 'rejected enough' of the elements that Thomas disliked\u00a0\u2013 \"Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality\". Apologetically, in a letter to Keidrych Rhys, editor of the literary magazine \"Wales\", Thomas's father wrote that he was \"afraid Dylan isn't much of a Welshman\". Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas's negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father's hostility towards the Welsh language.\nCritical reception.\nThomas's work and stature as a poet have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death. Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas's personality and mythology, especially his drunken persona and death in New York. When Seamus Heaney gave an Oxford lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly, \"Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry\", querying how 'Thomas the Poet' is one of his forgotten attributes. David Holbrook, who has written three books about Thomas, stated in his 1962 publication \"Llareggub Revisited\", \"the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas's notoriety\u2014not that he is bogus, but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige, effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry, but also destroyed his true voice and, at last, him.\" The Poetry Archive notes that \"Dylan Thomas's detractors accuse him of being drunk on language as well as whiskey, but whilst there's no doubt that the sound of language is central to his style, he was also a disciplined writer who re-drafted obsessively\".\nMany critics have argued that Thomas's work is too narrow and that he suffers from verbal extravagance. Those that have championed his work have found the criticism baffling. Robert Lowell wrote in 1947, \"Nothing could be more wrongheaded than the English disputes about Dylan Thomas's greatness\u00a0... He is a dazzling obscure writer who can be enjoyed without understanding.\" Kenneth Rexroth said, on reading \"Eighteen Poems\", \"The reeling excitement of a poetry-intoxicated schoolboy smote the Philistine as hard a blow with one small book as Swinburne had with \"Poems and Ballads\".\" Philip Larkin in a letter to Kingsley Amis in 1948, wrote that \"no one can 'stick words into us like pins'...\u00a0like he [Thomas] can\", but followed that by stating that he \"doesn't use his words to any advantage\". Amis was far harsher, finding little of merit in his work, and claiming that he was 'frothing at the mouth with piss.' In 1956, the publication of the anthology \"New Lines\" featuring works by the British collective The Movement, which included Amis and Larkin amongst its number, set out a vision of modern poetry that was damning towards the poets of the 1940s. Thomas's work in particular was criticised. David Lodge, writing about The Movement in 1981 stated \"Dylan Thomas was made to stand for everything they detest, verbal obscurity, metaphysical pretentiousness, and romantic rhapsodizing\".\nDespite criticism by sections of academia, Thomas's work has been embraced by readers more so than many of his contemporaries, and is one of the few modern poets whose name is recognised by the general public. In 2009, over 18,000 votes were cast in a BBC poll to find the UK's favourite poet; Thomas was placed 10th. Several of his poems have passed into the cultural mainstream, and his work has been used by authors, musicians and film and television writers. The BBC Radio programme, \"Desert Island Discs\", in which guests usually choose their favourite songs, has heard 50 participants select a Dylan Thomas recording. John Goodby states that this popularity with the reading public allows Thomas's work to be classed as vulgar and common. He also cites that despite a brief period during the 1960s when Thomas was considered a cultural icon, that the poet has been marginalized in critical circles due to his exuberance, in both life and work, and his refusal to know his place. Goodby believes that Thomas has been mainly snubbed since the 1970s and has become \"...\u00a0an embarrassment to twentieth-century poetry criticism\", his work failing to fit standard narratives and thus being ignored rather than studied.\nMemorials.\nIn Swansea's maritime quarter are the Dylan Thomas Theatre, home of the Swansea Little Theatre of which Thomas was once a member, and the former Guildhall built in 1825 and now occupied by the Dylan Thomas Centre, a literature centre, where exhibitions and lectures are held and setting for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival. Outside the centre stands a bronze statue of Thomas, by John Doubleday. Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park, one of his favourite childhood haunts, close to his birthplace. The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park cut by and inscribed by the late sculptor Ronald Cour with the closing lines from Fern Hill.\n&lt;poem&gt;\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThomas's home in Laugharne, the Boathouse, is a museum run by Carmarthenshire County Council. Thomas's writing shed is also preserved. In 2004, the Dylan Thomas Prize was created in his honour, awarded to the best published writer in English under the age of 30. In 2005, the Dylan Thomas Screenplay Award was established. The prize, administered by the Dylan Thomas Centre, is awarded at the annual Swansea Bay Film Festival. In 1982 a plaque was unveiled in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey. The plaque is also inscribed with the last two lines of Fern Hill.\nIn 2014, to celebrate the centenary of Thomas's birth, the British Council Wales undertook a year-long programme of cultural and educational works. Highlights included a touring replica of Thomas's work shed, Sir Peter Blake's exhibition of illustrations based on \"Under Milk Wood\" and a 36-hour marathon of readings, which included Michael Sheen and Sir Ian McKellen performing Thomas's work. The Royal Patron of The Dylan Thomas 100 Festival was Charles, Prince of Wales, who made a recording of \"Fern Hill\" for the event."}
{"id": "8785", "revid": "37379628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8785", "title": "Fern Hill", "text": "Fern Hill (1945) is a poem by the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, first published in the October, 1945, Horizon magazine, with its first book publication as the last poem in \"Deaths and Entrances\".\nThe house Fernhill is just outside Llangain in Carmarthenshire, Wales. Thomas had extended stays here in the 1920s with his aunt Annie and her husband, Jim Jones, and wrote about the house in his short story, \"The Peaches\". His holidays here have been recalled in interviews with his schoolboy friends, and both the house and the Thomas family network in the area are detailed in the same book. A further account describes both Thomas\u2019 childhood and later years on the family farms between Llangain and Llansteffan, as well as questioning whether the poem Fern Hill was inspired by the house Fernhill. \nLinguistic considerations.\nThe poem starts as a straightforward evocation of his childhood visits to his Aunt Annie's farm:\nIn the middle section, the idyllic scene is expanded upon, reinforced by the lilting rhythm of the poem, the dreamlike, pastoral metaphors and allusion to Eden. \nBy the end, the poet's older voice has taken over, mourning his lost youth with echoes of the opening:\nThe poem uses internal half rhyme and full rhyme as well as end rhyme. Thomas was very conscious of the effect of spoken or intoned verse and explored the potentialities of sound and rhythm, in a manner reminiscent of Gerard Manley Hopkins. He always denied having conscious knowledge of Welsh, but \"his lines chime with internal consonantal correspondence, or \"cynghanedd\", a prescribed feature of Welsh versification\".\nLegacy.\n\"Fern Hill\" has been set to music by the American composer John Corigliano, for SATB chorus with orchestral accompaniment.\nSamples of the \"Fern Hill\" poem read by Dylan Thomas himself are used in the track \"Apple Towns\" by the one-man act \"Reflection Nebula\".\n\"Happy as the Grass Was Green\" became the title of a 1973 drama film."}
{"id": "8786", "revid": "28066471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8786", "title": "David Bowie", "text": "David Robert Jones (8 January 194710 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie ( ), was an English singer-songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100\u00a0million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. \"Rolling Stone\" placed him among its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and named him the \"Greatest Rock Star Ever\" following his death in 2016.\nBorn in Brixton, South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single \"Starman\" and album \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\", which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album \"Young Americans\". In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\", directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released \"Station to Station\". In 1977, he further confounded expectations with the electronic-inflected album \"Low\", the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\". \"Heroes\" (1977) and \"Lodger\" (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its album \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\", and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with \"Let's Dance\"; its title track topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\" (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in \"Labyrinth\" (1986), Pontius Pilate in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988), and Nikola Tesla in \"The Prestige\" (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with \"The Next Day.\" He remained musically active until his death of liver cancer at his home in New York City, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, \"Blackstar\" (2016). \"Blackstar\" won British Album of the Year at the 2017 Brit Awards and five Grammy Awards at the 2017 Grammy Awards.\nEarly life.\nDavid Robert Jones was born on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary \"Peggy\" (n\u00e9e Burns; 2 October 1913 \u2013 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \"John\" Jones (21 November 1912 \u2013 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, Yorkshire and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child\u2014and a defiant brawler.\nFrom 1953 Bowie moved with his family to Bickley and then Bromley Common, before settling in Sundridge Park in 1955 where he attended Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \"adequate\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \"vividly artistic\" and his poise \"astonishing\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley (who shared Bowie's birthday), and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \"Tutti Frutti\", Bowie would later say that he had \"heard God\".\nBowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin Kristina dance to \"Hound Dog\" soon after it was released in 1956. According to Kristina, she and David \"danced like possessed elves\" to records of various artists. By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry\u2014complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists\u2014to his local Wolf Cub group was described as \"mesmerizing\u00a0... like someone from another planet\". Having encouraged his son to follow his dreams of being an entertainer since he was a toddler, in the late 1950s David's father took him to meet singers and other performers preparing for the Royal Variety Performance, introducing him to Alma Cogan and Tommy Steele. After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School.\nIt was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:\nBowie's maternal half-brother, Terry Burns, was a substantial influence on his early life. Burns, who was ten years older than Bowie, had schizophrenia and seizures, and lived alternately at home and in psychiatric wards; while living with Bowie, he introduced the younger man to many of his lifelong influences, such as modern jazz, Buddhism, Beat poetry, and the occult. In addition to Burns, a significant proportion of Bowie's extended family members had schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including an aunt who was institutionalised and another who underwent lobotomy; this has been labelled as an influence on his early work.\nBowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting. After Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a Grafton saxophone in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross. He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and anisocoria (a permanently dilated pupil), which gave a false impression of a change in the iris's colour, erroneously suggesting he had heterochromia iridum (one iris a different colour to the other); the eye later became one of Bowie's most recognisable features. Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.\nMusic career.\n1962\u20131967: Early career to debut album.\nBowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them. When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to \"do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles\u2014and make another million.\" Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to Dick James's partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.\nConn quickly began to promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, \"Liza Jane\", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul\u2014\"I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger\", Bowie was to recall. Their cover of Bobby Bland's \"I Pity the Fool\" was no more successful than \"Liza Jane\", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by The Who. \"You've Got a Habit of Leaving\" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world \"to study mime at Sadler's Wells\", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, \"Do Anything You Say\". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the Riot Squad; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by The Velvet Underground, went unreleased. Kenneth Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.\nDissatisfied with his stage name as Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Bowie renamed himself after the 19th-century American pioneer James Bowie and the knife he had popularised. His April 1967 solo single, \"The Laughing Gnome\", using speeded-up thus high-pitched vocals, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, \"David Bowie\", an amalgam of pop, psychedelia, and music hall, met the same fate. It was his last release for two years.\n1968\u20131971: \"Space Oddity\" to \"Hunky Dory\".\nStudying the dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, the Bowie composition \"Over the Wall We Go\" became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie song, \"Silly Boy Blue\", was released by Billy Fury the following year. Playing acoustic guitar, Hermione Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry, and mime.\nAfter the break-up with Farthingale, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger. In February and March 1969, he undertook a short tour with Marc Bolan's duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, as third on the bill, performing a mime act. On 11 July 1969, \"Space Oddity\" was released five days ahead of the Apollo 11 launch, and reached the top five in the UK. Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham High Street. The club was influenced by the Arts Lab movement, developing into the Beckenham Arts Lab and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, the subject of his song \"Memory of a Free Festival\".\nBowie's second album followed in November; originally issued in the UK as \"David Bowie\", it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the early US release was instead titled \"Man of Words/Man of Music\"; it was reissued internationally in 1972 by RCA Records as \"Space Oddity\". Featuring philosophical post-hippie lyrics on peace, love, and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release.\nBowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving manager Ken Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating. Having established himself as a solo artist with \"Space Oddity\", Bowie began to sense a lacking: \"a full-time band for gigs and recording\u2014people he could relate to personally\". The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with Marc Bolan, who was at the time acting as his session guitarist. The band Bowie assembled comprised John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, Tony Visconti on bass and Mick Ronson on electric guitar. Known as Hype, the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders from Mars. After a disastrous opening gig at the London Roundhouse, they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist. Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter's drumming style. Matters came to a head when an enraged Bowie accused the drummer of the disturbance, exclaiming \"You're fucking up my album.\" Cambridge left and was replaced by Mick Woodmansey. Not long after, the singer fired his manager and replaced him with Tony Defries. This resulted in years of litigation that concluded with Bowie having to pay Pitt compensation.\nThe studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie's third album, \"The Man Who Sold the World\" (1970), which contained references to schizophrenia, paranoia, and delusion. Characterised by the heavy rock sound of his new backing band, it was a marked departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by \"Space Oddity\". To promote it in the US, Mercury Records financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour across America in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by radio stations and the media. Exploiting his androgynous appearance, the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted the singer wearing a dress: taking the garment with him, he wore it during interviews\u2014to the approval of critics, including \"Rolling Stone\"s John Mendelsohn who described him as \"ravishing, almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall\"\u00a0\u2013 and in the street, to mixed reaction including laughter and, in the case of one male pedestrian, producing a gun and telling Bowie to \"kiss my ass\".\nDuring the tour, Bowie's observation of two seminal American proto-punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing \"the ultimate pop idol\". A girlfriend recalled his \"scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy\", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character \"who looks like he's landed from Mars\". The \"Stardust\" surname was a tribute to the \"Legendary Stardust Cowboy\", whose record he was given during the tour. Bowie would later cover \"I Took a Trip on a Gemini Space Ship\" on 2002's \"Heathen\".\n\"Hunky Dory\" (1971) found Visconti, Bowie's producer and bassist, supplanted in both roles by Ken Scott and Trevor Bolder respectively. The album saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of \"Space Oddity\", with light fare such as \"Kooks\", a song written for his son, Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones, born on 30 May. (His parents chose \"his kooky name\"\u2014he was known as Zowie for the next 12 years\u2014after the Greek word \"zoe\", life.) Elsewhere, the album explored more serious subjects, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with \"Song for Bob Dylan\", \"Andy Warhol\", and \"Queen Bitch\", the latter a Velvet Underground pastiche. It was not a significant commercial success at the time.\n1972\u20131974: \"Ziggy Stardust\".\nDressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars\u2014Ronson, Bolder, and Woodmansey\u2014at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth in Kingston upon Thames on 10 February 1972. The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a \"cult of Bowie\" that was \"unique\u2014its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom.\" \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\" (1972), combining the hard rock elements of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" with the lighter experimental rock and pop of \"Hunky Dory\", was released in June. \"Starman\", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July \"Top of the Pops\" performance of the song. The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the 6-month-old \"Hunky Dory\". At the same time the non-album single \"John, I'm Only Dancing\", and \"All the Young Dudes\", a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople, were successful in the UK. The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States.\nBowie contributed backing vocals, keyboards, and guitar to Reed's 1972 solo breakthrough \"Transformer\", co-producing the album with Mick Ronson. The following year, Bowie co-produced and mixed The Stooges album \"Raw Power\" alongside Iggy Pop. His own \"Aladdin Sane\" (1973) topped the UK chart, his first number-one album. Described by Bowie as \"Ziggy goes to America\", it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album. \"Aladdin Sane\" spawned the UK top five singles \"The Jean Genie\" and \"Drive-In Saturday\".\nBowie's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. \"Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David.\" With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust\u2014and later, the Thin White Duke\u2014from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, \"wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour\u00a0... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity.\" His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both \"Ziggy Stardust\" and \"Aladdin Sane\", were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage \"retirement\" at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film \"Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\".\nAfter breaking up the Spiders from Mars, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona. His back catalogue was now highly sought after: \"The Man Who Sold the World\" had been re-released in 1972 along with \"Space Oddity\". \"Life on Mars?\", from \"Hunky Dory\", was released in June 1973 and peaked at No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Entering the same chart in September, Bowie's novelty record from 1967, \"The Laughing Gnome\", reached No. 6. \"Pin Ups\", a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK No. 3 hit in his version of the McCoys's \"Sorrow\" and itself peaking at number one, making David Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.\n1974\u20131976: \"Plastic soul\" and the Thin White Duke.\nBowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. \"Diamond Dogs\" (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's \"1984\" to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Diamond Dogs\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, \"Cracked Actor\", featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, \"David Live\", ought to have been titled \"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\". \"David Live\" nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \"Knock on Wood\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.\nThe fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was \"Young Americans\" (1975). Biographer Christopher Sandford writes, \"Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now.\" The album's sound, which the singer identified as \"plastic soul\", constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. \"Young Americans\" yielded Bowie's first US number one, \"Fame\", co-written with John Lennon, who contributed backing vocals, and Carlos Alomar. Lennon called Bowie's work \"great, but it's just rock'n'roll with lipstick on\". Earning the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the US variety show \"Soul Train\", Bowie mimed \"Fame\", as well as \"Golden Years\", his November single, which was originally offered to Elvis Presley, who declined it. \"Young Americans\" was a commercial success in both the US and the UK, and a re-issue of the 1969 single \"Space Oddity\" became Bowie's first number-one hit in the UK a few months after \"Fame\" achieved the same in the US. Despite his by now well established superstardom, Bowie, in the words of Sandford, \"for all his record sales (over a million copies of \"Ziggy Stardust\" alone), existed essentially on loose change.\" In 1975, in a move echoing Ken Pitt's acrimonious dismissal five years earlier, Bowie fired his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, \"millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered\" in what were \"uniquely generous terms for Defries\", then \"shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door.\" Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year.\n\"Station to Station\" (1976), produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin, introduced a new Bowie persona, \"The Thin White Duke\" of its title-track. Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" the same year. Developing the funk and soul of \"Young Americans\", \"Station to Station\"'s synthesizer-heavy arrangements prefigured the krautrock-influenced music of his next releases. The extent to which drug addiction was now affecting Bowie was made public when Russell Harty interviewed the singer for his London Weekend Television talk show in anticipation of the album's supporting tour. Shortly before the satellite-linked interview was scheduled to commence, the death of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco was announced. Bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking, to allow the Spanish Government to put out a live newsfeed. This he refused to do, and his interview went ahead. In the ensuing lengthy conversation with Harty, Bowie was incoherent and looked \"disconnected\". His sanity\u2014by his own later admission\u2014had become twisted from cocaine; he overdosed several times during the year, and was withering physically to an alarming degree.\n\"Station to Station\"s January 1976 release was followed in February by a 3-month-long concert tour of Europe and North America. Featuring a starkly lit set, the Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour with its colour newsprint Isolar concert program, highlighted songs from the album, including the dramatic and lengthy title track, the ballads \"Wild Is the Wind\" and \"Word on a Wing\", and the funkier \"TVC 15\" and \"Stay\". The core band that coalesced to record this album and tour\u2014rhythm guitarist Carlos Alomar, bassist George Murray, and drummer Dennis Davis\u2014continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s. The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy. Bowie was quoted in Stockholm as saying that \"Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader\", and was detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing Nazi paraphernalia.\nMatters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \"Victoria Station incident\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in \"NME\". Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology\u00a0... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism\u00a0... I'd discovered King Arthur\". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in \"The Times\", \"he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs.\" Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had motivated these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with \"NME\", Bowie explained that Los Angeles was \"where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is.\"\nAfter recovering from addiction, Bowie apologised for these statements, and throughout the 1980s and '90s criticised racism in European politics and the American music industry. Nevertheless, Bowie's comments on fascism, as well as Eric Clapton's alcohol-fuelled denunciations of Pakistani immigrants in 1976, led to the establishment of Rock Against Racism.\n1976\u20131979: Berlin era.\nBefore the end of 1976, Bowie's interest in the burgeoning German music scene, as well as his drug addiction, prompted him to move to West Berlin to clean up and revitalise his career. There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on Hauptstra\u00dfe in Sch\u00f6neberg and Hansa Tonstudio, the recording studio he used, located on K\u00f6thener Stra\u00dfe in Kreuzberg, near the Berlin Wall. While working with Brian Eno and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with Tony Visconti, that became known as his Berlin Trilogy. During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut \"The Idiot\" and its follow-up \"Lust for Life\", touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.\nThe album \"Low\" (1977), partly influenced by the Krautrock sound of Kraftwerk and Neu!, evinced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional. Although he completed the album in November 1976, it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it. It received considerable negative criticism upon its release\u2014a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's former manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent. Despite these forebodings, \"Low\" yielded the UK No. 3 single \"Sound and Vision\", and its own performance surpassed that of \"Station to Station\" in the UK chart, where it reached No. 2. Contemporary composer Philip Glass described \"Low\" as \"a work of genius\" in 1992, when he used it as the basis for his \"Symphony No. 1 \"Low\"\"; subsequently, Glass used Bowie's next album as the basis for his 1996 \"Symphony No. 4 \"Heroes\"\". Glass has praised Bowie's gift for creating \"fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces\". Also in 1977, London released \"Starting Point\", a ten-song LP containing releases from Bowie's Deram period (1966\u201467).\nEchoing \"Low\"s minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, \"Heroes\" (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by guitarist Robert Fripp. Like \"Low\", \"Heroes\" evinced the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city of Berlin. Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and koto, the album was another hit, reaching No. 3 in the UK. Its title-track, though only reaching No. 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French. Towards the end of the year, Bowie performed the song for Marc Bolan's television show \"Marc\", and again two days later for Bing Crosby's final CBS television Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in \"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\", a version of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" with a new, contrapuntal verse. Five years later, the duet proved a worldwide seasonal hit, charting in the UK at No. 3 on Christmas Day, 1982.\nAfter completing \"Low\" and \"Heroes\", Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was \"Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage.\u00a0... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends.\" Recordings from the tour made up the live album \"Stage\", released the same year. Bowie also recorded narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev's classical composition \"Peter and the Wolf\", which was released as an album in May 1978.\nThe final piece in what Bowie called his \"triptych\", \"Lodger\" (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music, in places incorporating Hijaz non-Western scales. Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards: \"Boys Keep Swinging\" entailed band members swapping instruments, \"Move On\" used the chords from Bowie's early composition \"All the Young Dudes\" played backwards, and \"Red Money\" took backing tracks from \"Sister Midnight\", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop. The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, \"It would be fair to call it Bowie's \"Sergeant Pepper\"\u00a0... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology.\" As described by biographer Christopher Sandford, \"The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end\u2014for fifteen years\u2014of Bowie's partnership with Eno.\" \"Lodger\" reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles \"Boys Keep Swinging\" and \"DJ\". Towards the end of the year, Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.\n1980\u20131988: New Romantic and pop era.\n\"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\" (1980) produced the number-one hit \"Ashes to Ashes\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \"Space Oddity\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \"Blitz\"\u2014the main New Romantic hangout\u2014to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While \"Scary Monsters\" used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \"Ashes to Ashes\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a five-month run on Broadway on 29 July, starring as John Merrick in \"The Elephant Man\".\nBowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \"Under Pressure\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play \"Baal\". Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as \"David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal\". In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film \"Cat People\" came out, Bowie's title song, \"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.\nBowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with \"Let's Dance\". Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \"Modern Love\" and \"China Girl\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \"absorbing\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \"activated key archetypes in the pop world. 'Let's Dance', with its little narrative surrounding the young Aborigine couple, targeted 'youth', and 'China Girl', with its bare-bummed (and later partially censored) beach lovemaking scene (a homage to the film \"From Here to Eternity\"), was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV\". Stevie Ray Vaughan was guest guitarist playing solo on \"Let's Dance\", although the video depicts Bowie miming this part. By 1983, Bowie had emerged as one of the most important video artists of the day. \"Let's Dance\" was followed by the Serious Moonlight Tour, during which Bowie was accompanied by guitarist Earl Slick and backing vocalists Frank and George Simms. The world tour lasted six months and was extremely popular.\" At the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards Bowie received two awards including the inaugural Video Vanguard Award.\n\"Tonight\" (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \"God Only Knows\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \"Blue Jean\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, \"Jazzin' for Blue Jean\". Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \"Dancing in the Street\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \"This Is Not America\" for the soundtrack of \"The Falcon and the Snowman\". Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.\nBowie was given a role in the 1986 film \"Absolute Beginners\". It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \"Absolute Beginners\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film \"Labyrinth\", for which he worked with composer Trevor Jones and wrote five original songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's \"Never Let Me Down\", where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \"Day-In, Day-Out\" (his 60th single), \"Time Will Crawl\", and \"Never Let Me Down\". Bowie later described it as his \"nadir\", calling it \"an awful album\". Supporting \"Never Let Me Down\", and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although in later years critics acknowledged the tour's strengths and influence on concert tours by other artists, such as Britney Spears, Madonna, and U2.\n1989\u20131991: Tin Machine.\nBowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album \"Lust for Life\".\nAlthough he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, \"Tin Machine\" (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV\u00a0... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\" EMI complained of \"lyrics that preach\" as well as \"repetitive tunes\" and \"minimalist or no production\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.\nTin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance\u2014among fans and critics alike\u2014to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.\nIn October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, \"I was naming the children the night we met\u00a0... it was absolutely immediate.\" They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. \"Tin Machine II\"s arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, Victory, deemed the depiction of four ancient nude Kouroi statues, judged by Bowie to be \"in exquisite taste\", to be \"a show of wrong, obscene images\", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless. Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album \"\" failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.\n1992\u20131998: Electronic period.\nOn 20 April 1992, Bowie appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen singer's death the previous year. As well as performing \"Heroes\" and \"All the Young Dudes\", he was joined on \"Under Pressure\" by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury's vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie knelt and recited the Lord's Prayer at Wembley Stadium. Four days later, Bowie and Iman were married in Switzerland. Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived. They settled in New York instead.\nIn 1993, Bowie released his first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure, the soul, jazz, and hip-hop influenced \"Black Tie White Noise\". Making prominent use of electronic instruments, the album, which reunited Bowie with \"Let's Dance\" producer Nile Rodgers, confirmed Bowie's return to popularity, hitting the number-one spot on the UK charts and spawning three Top 40 hits, including the Top 10 single \"Jump They Say\". Bowie explored new directions on \"The Buddha of Suburbia\" (1993), ostensibly a soundtrack album of his music composed for the BBC television adaptation of Hanif Kureishi's novel. Only the title track had been used in the television adaptation, although some of his themes for it were also present on the album. It contained some of the new elements introduced in \"Black Tie White Noise\", and also signalled a move towards alternative rock. The album was a critical success but received a low-key release and only made No. 87 in the UK charts.\nReuniting Bowie with Eno, the quasi-industrial \"Outside\" (1995) was originally conceived as the first volume in a non-linear narrative of art and murder. Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie, the album achieved UK and US chart success, and yielded three Top 40 UK singles. In a move that provoked mixed reaction from both fans and critics, Bowie chose Nine Inch Nails as his tour partner for the Outside Tour. Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February 1996, the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie's guitarist. On 7 January 1997, Bowie celebrated his half century with a 50th birthday concert at Madison Square Garden, New York, at which he was joined in playing his songs and those of his guests, Lou Reed, Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, Robert Smith of the Cure, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Black Francis of the Pixies, and Sonic Youth.\nBowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 17 January 1996. Incorporating experiments in British jungle and drum 'n' bass, \"Earthling\" (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album \u2013 \"Little Wonder\" and \"Dead Man Walking\" \u2013 became UK Top 40 hits. Bowie's song \"I'm Afraid of Americans\" from the Paul Verhoeven film \"Showgirls\" was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by Trent Reznor for a single release. The heavy rotation of the accompanying video, also featuring Trent Reznor, contributed to the song's 16-week stay in the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Reznor also executive produced the \"Lost Highway\" soundtrack (1997) which begins and ends with different mixes of Bowie's \"Outside\" song \"I'm Deranged\". Bowie received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 12 February 1997. The Earthling Tour took in Europe and North America between June and November 1997. In November 1997, Bowie performed on the BBC's Children in Need charity single \"Perfect Day\", which reached number one in the UK. Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record \"(Safe in This) Sky Life\" for \"The Rugrats Movie\". Although the track was edited out of the final cut, it was later re-recorded and released as \"Safe\" on the B-side of Bowie's 2002 single \"Everyone Says 'Hi'. The reunion led to other collaborations including a limited-edition single release version of Placebo's track \"Without You I'm Nothing\", co-produced by Visconti, with Bowie's harmonised vocal added to the original recording.\n1999\u20132012: Neoclassicist era.\nBowie, with Reeves Gabrels, created the soundtrack for \"\", a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also voiced characters based on their likenesses. Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from \"Omikron\", his album \"Hours\" featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his \"Cyber Song Contest\" Internet competition, Alex Grant. Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica. Sessions for the planned album \"Toy\", intended to feature new versions of some of Bowie's earliest pieces as well as three new songs, commenced in 2000, but the album was never released. Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album \"Heathen\".\nOn 25 June 2000, Bowie made his second appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in England, playing 30 years after his first. The performance was released as a posthumous live album in November 2018. On 27 June, Bowie performed a concert at BBC Radio Theatre in London, which was released in the compilation album \"Bowie at the Beeb\", which also featured BBC recording sessions from 1968 to 1972. Bowie and Iman's daughter was born on 15 August. His interest in Buddhism led him to support the Tibetan cause by performing at the February 2001 and February 2003 concerts to support Tibet House US at Carnegie Hall in New York.\nIn October 2001, Bowie opened the Concert for New York City, a charity event to benefit the victims of the September 11 attacks, with a minimalist performance of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's \"America\", followed by a full band performance of \"Heroes\". 2002 saw the release of \"Heathen\", and, during the second half of the year, the Heathen Tour. Taking place in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London's annual \"Meltdown\" festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director. Among the acts he selected for the festival were Philip Glass, Television, and the Dandy Warhols. As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie's \"Low\" era. \"Reality\" (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the A Reality Tour, with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004. On 13 June, Bowie headlined the last night of the Isle of Wight Festival 2004, his final live show in the UK. On 25 June, he suffered chest pain while performing at the Hurricane Festival in Schee\u00dfel, Germany. Originally thought to be a pinched nerve in his shoulder, the pain was later diagnosed as an acutely blocked coronary artery, requiring an emergency angioplasty in Hamburg. The remaining 14 dates of the tour were cancelled.\nIn the years following his recuperation from the heart attack, Bowie reduced his musical output, making only one-off appearances on stage and in the studio. He sang in a duet of his 1971 song \"Changes\" with Butterfly Boucher for the 2004 animated film \"Shrek 2\". During a relatively quiet 2005, he recorded the vocals for the song \"(She Can) Do That\", co-written with Brian Transeau, for the film \"Stealth\". He returned to the stage on 8 September 2005, appearing with Arcade Fire for the US nationally televised event Fashion Rocks, and performed with the Canadian band for the second time a week later during the CMJ Music Marathon. He contributed backing vocals on TV on the Radio's song \"Province\" for their album \"Return to Cookie Mountain\", and joined with Lou Reed on Danish alt-rockers Kashmir's 2005 album \"No Balance Palace\".\nBowie was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 February 2006. In April, he announced, \"I'm taking a year off\u2014no touring, no albums.\" He made a surprise guest appearance at David Gilmour's 29 May concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The event was recorded, and a selection of songs on which he had contributed joint vocals were subsequently released. He performed again in November, alongside Alicia Keys, at the Black Ball, a benefit event for Keep a Child Alive at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York. The performance marked the last time Bowie performed his music on stage.\nBowie was chosen to curate the 2007 High Line Festival, selecting musicians and artists for the Manhattan event, including electronic pop duo AIR, surrealist photographer Claude Cahun, and English comedian Ricky Gervais. Bowie performed on Scarlett Johansson's 2008 album of Tom Waits covers, \"Anywhere I Lay My Head\". In June 2008 a live album was released of a Ziggy Stardust-era concert from 1972. On the 40th anniversary of the July 1969 moon landing\u2014and Bowie's accompanying commercial breakthrough with \"Space Oddity\"\u2014EMI released the individual tracks from the original eight-track studio recording of the song, in a 2009 contest inviting members of the public to create a remix. \"A Reality Tour\", a double album of live material from the 2003 concert tour, was released in January 2010.\nIn late March 2011, \"Toy\", Bowie's previously unreleased album from 2001, was leaked onto the internet, containing material used for \"Heathen\" and most of its single B-sides, as well as unheard new versions of his early back catalogue.\n2013\u20132016: Final years.\nOn 8 January 2013, his 66th birthday, his website announced a new album, to be titled \"The Next Day\" and scheduled for release 8 March for Australia, 12 March for the United States, and 11 March for the rest of the world. Bowie's first studio album in a decade, \"The Next Day\" contains 14 songs plus 3 bonus tracks. His website acknowledged the length of his hiatus. Record producer Tony Visconti said 29 tracks were recorded for the album, some of which could appear on Bowie's next record, which he might start work on later in 2013. The announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of a single, \"Where Are We Now?\", written and recorded by Bowie in New York and produced by longtime collaborator Visconti.\nA music video for \"Where Are We Now?\" was released onto Vimeo the same day, directed by New York artist Tony Oursler. The single topped the UK iTunes Chart within hours of its release, and debuted in the UK Singles Chart at No. 6, his first single to enter the Top 10 for two decades (since \"Jump They Say\" in 1993). A second video, \"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\", was released 25 February. Directed by Floria Sigismondi, it stars Bowie and Tilda Swinton as a married couple. On 1 March, the album was made available to stream for free through iTunes. \"The Next Day\" debuted at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, was his first album to achieve that position since \"Black Tie White Noise\" (1993), and was the fastest-selling album of 2013 at the time. The music video for the song \"The Next Day\" created some controversy, initially being removed from YouTube for terms-of-service violation, then restored with a warning recommending viewing only by those 18 or over.\nAccording to \"The Times\", Bowie ruled out ever giving an interview again. Later in 2013, Bowie was featured in a cameo vocal in the Arcade Fire song \"Reflektor\". A poll carried out by BBC History Magazine, in October 2013, named Bowie as the best-dressed Briton in history. In mid-2014, Bowie was diagnosed with liver cancer, a diagnosis he kept private. New information was released in September 2014 regarding his next compilation album, \"Nothing Has Changed\", which was released in November. The album featured rare tracks and old material from his catalogue in addition to a new song titled \"Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)\". In May 2015, \"Let's Dance\" was announced to be reissued as a yellow vinyl single on 16 July 2015 in conjunction with the \"David Bowie Is\" exhibition at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, Australia.\nIn August 2015, it was announced that Bowie was writing songs for a Broadway musical based on the \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" cartoon series. Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series \"The Last Panthers\", which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for \"The Last Panthers\" was also the title track for his January 2016 release \"Blackstar\" which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock-influenced work. According to \"The Times\": \"\"Blackstar\" may be the oddest work yet from Bowie\". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical \"Lazarus\" debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.\n\"Blackstar\" was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a \"parting gift\" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-\"Blackstar\" album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day. On 15 January, \"Blackstar\" debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart. \"Blackstar\" also debuted at number one on album charts around the world, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the US \"Billboard\" 200.\n2016\u2013present: Posthumous releases.\nIn September 2016 a box set was released covering Bowie's mid-70s soul period, including \"The Gouster\", a previously unreleased 1974 album. An EP, \"No Plan\", was released on 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday. Apart from \"Lazarus\", the EP includes three songs that Bowie recorded during the \"Blackstar\" sessions, but were left off the album and appeared on the soundtrack album for the \"Lazarus\" musical in October 2016. A music video for the title track was also released. 2017 and 2018 also saw the release of a series of posthumous live albums, covering the Diamond Dogs tour of 1974, the Isolar tour of 1976 and the Isolar II tour of 1978. In the two years following his death, Bowie sold 5\u00a0million records in the UK alone. In their top 10 list for the Global Recording Artist of the Year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry named Bowie the second-bestselling artist worldwide in 2016, behind Drake.\nAt the 59th Annual Grammy Awards on 12 February 2017, Bowie won all five nominated awards: Best Rock Performance; Best Alternative Music Album; Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; Best Recording Package; and Best Rock Song. They were Bowie's first Grammy wins in musical categories. On 8 January 2020, on what would have been Bowie's 73rd birthday, a previously unreleased version of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was released and two releases were announced: a streaming-only EP, \"Is It Any Wonder?,\" and an album, \"CHANGESNOWBOWIE\", released in November 2020 for Record Store Day. In August 2020, another series of live shows were released, including sets from Dallas in 1995 and Paris in 1999. These and other shows, part of a series of live concerts spanning his tours from 1995 to 1999, was released in late 2020 and early 2021 as part of the box set \"Brilliant Live Adventures\".\nActing career.\nWhile always primarily a musician, Bowie took acting roles throughout his career, appearing in over 30 movies, television shows and theatrical productions. Bowie's acting career was \"productively selective,\" largely eschewing starring roles for cameos and supporting parts. Many critics have observed that, had Bowie not chosen to pursue music, he could have found great success as an actor. Other critics have noted that, while his screen presence was singular, his best contributions to film were the use of his songs in movies like \"Lost Highway\", \"A Knight's Tale\", \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" and \"Inglourious Basterds\".\n1960s and 1970s.\nThe beginnings of Bowie's acting career predate his commercial breakthrough as a musician. Studying avant-garde theatre and mime under Lindsay Kemp, he was given the role of Cloud in Kemp's 1967 theatrical production \"Pierrot in Turquoise\" (later made into the 1970 television film \"The Looking Glass Murders\"). Bowie filmed a walk-on role for the BBC drama series \"Theater 625\" that aired in May 1968. In the black-and-white short \"The Image\" (1969), he played a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him. The same year, the film of Leslie Thomas's 1966 comic novel \"The Virgin Soldiers\" saw Bowie make a brief appearance as an extra.\nIn 1976, Bowie earned acclaim for his first major film role, portraying Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet, in \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\", directed by Nicolas Roeg. He later admitted that his severe cocaine use during the film's production left him in such a fragile state of mind that he barely understood the movie. \"Just a Gigolo\" (1979), an Anglo-German co-production directed by David Hemmings, saw Bowie in the lead role as Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, is discovered by a Baroness (Marlene Dietrich) and put into her gigolo stable. The movie was a critical and commercial bomb, and Bowie later expressed embarrassment at his role in it.\n1980s.\nBowie played Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre production \"The Elephant Man\", which he undertook wearing no stage make-up, and which earned high praise for his expressive performance. He played the part 157 times between 1980 and 1981. \"Christiane F. \u2013 We Children from Bahnhof Zoo\", a 1981 biographical film focusing on a young girl's drug addiction in West Berlin, featured Bowie in a cameo appearance as himself at a concert in Germany. Its soundtrack album, \"Christiane F.\" (1981), featured much material from his Berlin Trilogy albums. In 1982, he starred in the titular role in a BBC adaptation of the Bertolt Brecht play \"Baal\". Bowie portrayed a vampire in Tony Scott's erotic horror film \"The Hunger\" (1983), with Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. In Nagisa Oshima's film the same year, \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\", based on Laurens van der Post's novel \"The Seed and the Sower\", Bowie played Major Jack Celliers, a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp. Bowie had a cameo in \"Yellowbeard\", a 1983 pirate comedy created by Monty Python members and directed by Mel Damski.\nTo promote the single \"Blue Jean\" Bowie filmed the 21 minute short film \"Jazzin' for Blue Jean\" (1984) with director Julien Temple, and played the dual roles of romantic protagonist Vic and arrogant rock star Screaming Lord Byron. The short won Bowie his only non-posthumous Grammy award. Bowie had a supporting role as hitman Colin in the 1985 John Landis film \"Into the Night\". He declined to play the villain Max Zorin in the James Bond film \"A View to a Kill\" (1985). Bowie reteamed with Temple for \"Absolute Beginners\" (1986), a rock musical film adapted from Colin MacInnes's book of the same name about life in late 1950s London, in a supporting role as ad man Vendice Partners. The same year, Jim Henson's dark musical fantasy \"Labyrinth\" cast him as Jareth, the villainous Goblin King. Despite initial poor box office, the movie grew in popularity and became a cult film. Two years later, he played Pontius Pilate in Martin Scorsese's critically acclaimed biblical epic \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988).\n1990s.\nIn 1991, Bowie reteamed with director John Landis for an episode of the HBO sitcom \"Dream On\" and played a disgruntled restaurant employee opposite Rosanna Arquette in \"The Linguini Incident\". Bowie portrayed the mysterious FBI agent Phillip Jeffries in David Lynch's ' (1992). The prequel to the television series was poorly received at the time of its release, but has since been critically reevaluated. He took a small but pivotal role as his friend Andy Warhol in \"Basquiat\", artist/director Julian Schnabel's 1996 biopic of Jean-Michel Basquiat, another artist he considered a friend and colleague. Bowie co-starred in Giovanni Veronesi's Spaghetti Western \"Il Mio West\" (1998, released as \"Gunslinger's Revenge\" in the US in 2005) as the most feared gunfighter in the region. He played the aging gangster Bernie in Andrew Goth's \"Everybody Loves Sunshine\" (1999, released in the U.S. as \"B.U.S.T.E.D.\"), and appeared as the host in the second season of the television horror anthology series \"The Hunger\". Despite having several episodes which focus on vampires and Bowie's involvement, the show had no plot connection to the 1983 film of the same name. In 1999, Bowie voiced two characters in the Sega Dreamcast game ', his only appearance in a video game.\n2000s and posthumous notes.\nIn \"Mr. Rice's Secret\" (2000), Bowie played the title role as the neighbour of a terminally ill 12-year-old. Bowie appeared as himself in the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy \"Zoolander\", judging a \"walk-off\" between rival male models, and in Eric Idle's 2002 mockumentary \"\". In 2005, he filmed a commercial with Snoop Dogg for XM Satellite Radio. Bowie portrayed a fictionalized version of physicist and inventor Nikola Tesla in Christopher Nolan's film \"The Prestige\" (2006), which was about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century. Nolan later claimed that Bowie was his only preference to play Tesla, and that he personally appealed to Bowie to take the role after he initially passed. In the same year, he voice-acted in Luc Besson's animated film \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" as the powerful villain Maltazard, and appeared as himself in an episode of the Ricky Gervais television series \"Extras\". In 2007, he lent his voice to the character Lord Royal Highness in the \"SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis\" television film. In the 2008 film \"August\", directed by Austin Chick, he played a supporting role as Ogilvie, a \"ruthless venture capitalist.\" Bowie's final film appearance was a cameo as himself in the 2009 teen comedy \"Bandslam\".\nIn a 2017 interview with \"Consequence of Sound\", director Denis Villeneuve revealed his intention to cast Bowie in \"Blade Runner 2049\" as the lead villain, Niander Wallace, but when news broke of Bowie's death in January of the same year, Villeneuve was forced to look for talent with similar \"rock star\" qualities. He eventually cast actor and lead singer of Thirty Seconds to Mars, Jared Leto. Talking about the casting process, Villeneuve said: \"Our first thought [for the character] had been David Bowie, who had influenced \"Blade Runner\" in many ways. When we learned the sad news, we looked around for someone like that. He [Bowie] embodied the Blade Runner spirit.\". David Lynch also hoped to have Bowie reprise his \"Fire Walk With Me\" character for \"Twin Peaks: The Return\" but Bowie's illness prevented this. His character was portrayed via archival footage. At Bowie's request, Lynch overdubbed Bowie's original dialogue with a different actor's voice, as Bowie was unhappy with his Cajun accent in the original movie.\nOther works.\nPainter and art collector.\nBowie was also a painter and artist. He moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills to the north of Lake Geneva. In the new environment, his cocaine use decreased and he found time for other pursuits outside his musical career. He devoted more time to his painting, and produced a number of post-modernist pieces. When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference. Visiting galleries in Geneva and the Br\u00fccke Museum in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, \"a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art.\u00a0... Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art: locked in Clos des M\u00e9sanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography.\"\nOne of Bowie's paintings sold at auction in late 1990 for $500, and the cover for his 1995 album \"Outside\" is a close-up of a self-portrait (from a series of five) he painted that same year. His first solo show was at The Gallery, Cork Street in 1995, entitled 'New Afro/Pagan and Work: 1975\u20131995'. He was invited to join the editorial board of the journal \"Modern Painters\" in 1998, and participated in the art hoax later that year.\nIn 1998, during an interview with Michael Kimmelman for \"The New York Times\", he said \"Art was, seriously, the only thing I'd ever wanted to own.\" Subsequently, in a 1999 interview for the BBC, he said \"The only thing I buy obsessively and addictively is art\". His art collection, which included works by Damien Hirst, Derek Boshier, Frank Auerbach, Henry Moore, and Jean-Michel Basquiat among others, was valued at over \u00a310m in mid-2016.\nAfter his death, his family decided to sell most of the collection because they \"didn't have the space\" to store it. On 10 and 11 November, three auctions were held at Sotheby's in London, first with 47 lots and second with 208 paintings, drawings, and sculptures, third with 100 design lots. The items on sale represented about 65 percent of the collection. Exhibition of the works in the auction attracted 51,470 visitors, the auction itself was attended by 1,750 bidders, with over 1,000 more bidding online. The auctions has overall sale total \u00a332.9\u00a0million (app. $41.5\u00a0million), while the highest-selling item, Jean-Michel Basquiat's graffiti-inspired painting \"Air Power\", sold for \u00a37.09\u00a0million.\nBowie Bonds.\n\"Bowie Bonds\", the first modern example of celebrity bonds, were asset-backed securities of current and future revenues of the 25 albums (287 songs) that Bowie recorded before 1990. Issued in 1997, the bonds were bought for US$55\u00a0million by the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Royalties from the 25 albums generated the cash flow that secured the bonds' interest payments. By forfeiting ten years worth of royalties, Bowie received a payment of US$55\u00a0million up front. Bowie used this income to buy songs owned by his former manager, Tony Defries. The bonds liquidated in 2007 and the rights to the income from the songs reverted to Bowie.\nBowieNet.\nIn September 1998, Bowie launched an Internet service provider, BowieNet, developed in conjunction with Robert Goodale and Ron Roy. Subscribers to the dial-up service were offered exclusive content, as well as a BowieNet email address and Internet access. The service was closed by 2006.\nLegacy and influence.\nBowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Marc Bolan and Bowie with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement. When punk musicians were \"noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance\", biographer David Buckley wrote that \"Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation.\" Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, \"There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie\".\nMusicologist James Perone credited Bowie with having \"brought sophistication to rock music\", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The Human League founder Martyn Ware remarked that he had lived his life \"as though he were an art installation.\" The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was \"an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions\". U2 lead singer Bono commented, \"I like Bowie when he\u2019s evenly pulled in the direction of being a pop star and Picasso, where he's right down the middle. That\u2019s usually my favorite, when the songwriting is disciplined but the recording is not. I love when he's pulled equally in the directions of art and populism.\"\nBroadcaster John Peel contrasted Bowie with his progressive rock contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was \"an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things\". Peel said he \"liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change\". Buckley called the era \"bloated, self-important, leather-clad, self-satisfied\"; then Bowie \"subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star\".\nBuckley called Bowie \"both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced\u00a0... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\u00a0... His influence has been unique in popular culture\u2014he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\"\nThrough continual reinvention, his influence broadened and extended. Biographer Thomas Forget added, \"Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie.\" In 2000, Bowie was voted by other music stars as the \"most influential artist of all time\" in a poll by \"NME\". Alexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\" wrote that Bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be \"the most important and influential artist since the Beatles\". Neil McCormick of \"The Daily Telegraph\" stated that Bowie had \"one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century\" and \"he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with\". The BBC's Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for \"the creative powerhouse that Britain has become\" by challenging future generations \"to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks\". Easton concluded that Bowie had \"changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself\". In 2006, Bowie was voted the fourth greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC's \"Culture Show\". Annie Zaleski of \"Alternative Press\" wrote, \"Every band or solo artist who's decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie\". In 2016, he was dubbed \"The Greatest Rock Star Ever\" by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine.\nNumerous figures from the music industry whose careers Bowie had influenced paid tribute to him following his death; panegyrics on Twitter (tweets about him peaked at 20,000 a minute an hour after the announcement of his death) also came from outside the entertainment industry and pop culture, such as those from the Vatican, namely Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, who quoted \"Space Oddity\", and the Federal Foreign Office, which thanked Bowie for his part in the fall of the Berlin Wall and referenced \"Heroes\".\nBelgian amateur astronomers at the MIRA Public Observatory in conjunction with Studio Brussel created a \"Bowie asterism\" in homage to Bowie in January 2016; it depicts the lightning bolt of \"Aladdin Sane\" using the stars Sigma Librae, Spica, Zeta Centauri, SAO\u00a0204132, Sigma Octantis, SAO\u00a0241641 and Beta Trianguli Australis which were near Mars at the time of Bowie's death.\nOn 7 January 2017, the BBC broadcast the 90-minute documentary \"David Bowie: The Last Five Years\", taking a detailed look at Bowie's last albums, \"The Next Day\" and \"Blackstar\", and his play \"Lazarus\". On 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, a charity concert in his birthplace of Brixton was hosted by the actor Gary Oldman, a close friend. A David Bowie walking tour through Brixton was also launched, and other events marking his birthday weekend included concerts in New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, and Tokyo.\nOn 6 February 2018, the maiden flight of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket carried Elon Musk's personal Tesla Roadster and a mannequin affectionately named Starman into space. \"Space Oddity\" and \"Life on Mars?\" were looping on the car's sound system during the launch.\n\"David Bowie Is\".\nAn exhibition of Bowie artefacts, called \"David Bowie Is\", was organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and shown there in 2013. The London exhibit was visited by over 300,000 people, making it one of the most successful exhibitions ever staged at the museum. Later that year the exhibition began a world tour which started in Toronto and included stops in Chicago, Paris, Melbourne, Groningen and Brooklyn, New York where the exhibit ended in 2018 at the Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition hosted around 2,000,000 visitors over the entire course of its run.\n\"Stardust\" biopic.\nA biopic, \"Stardust\", was announced on 31 January 2019, with musician and actor Johnny Flynn as Bowie, Jena Malone as his wife Angie, and Marc Maron as his publicist. The film follows Bowie on his first trip to the United States in 1971. The film was written by Christopher Bell and directed by Gabriel Range. Bowie's son Duncan Jones spoke out against the film, saying he was not consulted and that the film would not have permission to use Bowie's music. The film was set to premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival, but the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMusicianship.\nFrom the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, \"David Bowie\" (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.\nMusicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, \"Space Oddity\", and later in the song \"Heroes\", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that \"in the lowest part of his vocal register\u00a0... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.\"\nVoice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as \"particularly deliberate and distinctive\". Schinder and Schwartz call him \"a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect.\" Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, the singer's role playing is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics \"arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them\u00a0... His voice changes dramatically from section to section.\" In a 2014 analysis of 77 \"top\" singers' vocal ranges, Bowie was 8th, just behind Christina Aguilera and just ahead of Paul McCartney. In addition to the guitar, Bowie also played a variety of keyboards, including piano, Mellotron, Chamberlin, and synthesizers; harmonica; alto and baritone saxophones; stylophone; viola; cello; koto (in the \"Heroes\" track \"Moss Garden\"); thumb piano; drums (on the \"Heathen\" track \"Cactus\"), and various percussion instruments.\nPersonal life.\nEarly relationships.\nBowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the London Dance Centre. He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image \"really blossomed\". \"He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus.\" In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play, \"The Pistol Shot\", in the Theatre 625 series, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale; the pair began dating, and moved into a London flat together. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film, \"Song of Norway\"; this affected him, and several songs, such as \"Letter to Hermione\" and \"Life on Mars?\" reference her, and for the video accompanying \"Where Are We Now?\", he wore a T-shirt with the words \"m/s Song of Norway\". They were last together in January 1969 for the filming of \"Love You till Tuesday\", a 30-minute film that was not released until 1984: intended as a promotional vehicle, it featured performances from Bowie's repertoire, including \"Space Oddity\", which had not been released when the film was made.\nFamily.\nBowie married his first wife, Mary Angela Barnett, on 19 March 1970 at Bromley Register Office in Bromley, London. They had an open marriage. Angela described their union as a marriage of convenience. \"We got married so that I could [get a permit to] work. I didn't think it would last and David said, before we got married, 'I'm not really in love with you' and I thought that's probably a good thing,\" she said. Bowie said about Angela that \"living with her is like living with a blow torch.\" Their son Duncan, born on 30 May 1971, was at first known as Zowie. Bowie and Angela divorced on 8 February 1980 in Switzerland. Bowie received custody of their son. After the gag order that was part of their divorce agreement ended, Angela wrote, \"Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side with David Bowie\", a memoir of their turbulent marriage.\nOn 24 April 1992, Bowie married Somali-American model Iman in a private ceremony in Lausanne. The wedding was later solemnised on 6 June in Florence. They had one daughter, Alexandria \"Lexi\" Zahra Jones, born in August 2000. The couple resided primarily in New York City and London, as well as owning an apartment in Sydney's Elizabeth Bay and Britannia Bay House on the island of Mustique.\nSexuality.\nBowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of \"Melody Maker\", coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, \"If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.\" In a September 1976 interview with \"Playboy\", Bowie said, \"It's true\u2014I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\" His first wife, Angie, supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.\nIn a 1983 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was \"the biggest mistake I ever made\" and \"I was always a closet heterosexual.\" On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.\n\"Blender\" asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, \"I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people.\" Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in \"puritanical\" America, \"I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.\"\nBuckley wrote that Bowie \"mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock\", and was probably \"never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual\", instead experimenting \"out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'.\" Biographer Christopher Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan\u2014with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969\u2014the singer and his first wife Angie \"created their bisexual fantasy\". Sandford wrote that Bowie \"made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke'\u00a0... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women.\" The BBC's Mark Easton wrote in 2016 that Britain was \"far more tolerant of difference\", and that gay rights (such as same-sex marriage) and gender equality would not have \"enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie's androgynous challenge all those years ago\".\nSpirituality and religion.\nOver the years, Bowie made numerous references to religions and to his evolving spirituality. Beginning in 1967 from the influence of his brother, he became interested in Buddhism and considered becoming a Buddhist monk. After a few months' study at Tibet House in London, he was told by a Lama, \"You don't want to be Buddhist... You should follow music.\" By 1975, Bowie admitted, \"I felt totally, absolutely alone. And I probably was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God.\" In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali \"in accordance with the Buddhist rituals\".\nAfter Bowie married Iman in a private ceremony in 1992, he said they knew that their \"real marriage, sanctified by God, had to happen in a church in Florence\". Earlier that year, he knelt on stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lord's Prayer before a television audience. In 1993, Bowie said he had an \"undying\" belief in the \"unquestionable\" existence of God. In a separate 1993 interview, while describing the genesis of the music for his album \"Black Tie White Noise\", he said \" \u2026 it was important for me to find something [musically] that also had no sort of representation of institutionalized and organized religion, of which I'm not a believer, I must make that clear.\" Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists \"is not a question that can be answered... I'm not quite an atheist and it worries me. There's that little bit that holds on: 'Well, I'm \"almost\" an atheist. Give me a couple of months... I've nearly got it right. He had a tattoo of the Serenity Prayer in Japanese on his left calf.\n\"Questioning [his] spiritual life [was] always\u00a0... germane\" to Bowie's songwriting. The song \"Station to Station\" is \"very much concerned with the Stations of the Cross\"; the song also specifically references Kabbalah. Bowie called the album \"extremely dark... the nearest album to a magick treatise that I've written\". \"Earthling\" showed \"the abiding need in me to vacillate between atheism or a kind of gnosticism... What I need is to find a balance, spiritually, with the way I live and my demise.\" Released shortly before his death, \"Lazarus\"\u2014from his final album, \"Blackstar\"\u2014began with the words, \"Look up here, I'm in Heaven\" while the rest of the album deals with other matters of mysticism and mortality.\nPolitics.\nIn 1976, speaking as The Thin White Duke, Bowie's persona at the time, and \"at least partially tongue-in-cheek\", he made statements that expressed support for fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with \"Playboy\", \"NME\", and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: \"Britain is ready for a fascist leader\u00a0... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership.\" He was also quoted as saying: \"Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars\" and \"You've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up.\" Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with \"Melody Maker\" in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: \"I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed.\" In the same interview, Bowie described himself as \"apolitical\", stating \"The more I travel and the less sure I am about exactly which political philosophies are commendable. The more government systems I see, the less enticed I am to give my allegiance to any set of people, so it would be disastrous for me to adopt a definitive point of view, or to adopt a party of people and say 'these are my people'.\"\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Bowie's public statements shifted sharply towards anti-racism and anti-fascism. In an interview with MTV anchor Mark Goodman in 1983, Bowie criticised the channel for not providing enough coverage of black musicians, becoming visibly uncomfortable when the host suggested concerns among midwestern viewers was a reason. The music videos for \"China Girl\" and \"Let's Dance\" were described by Bowie as a \"very simple, very direct\" statement against racism. The album \"Tin Machine\" took a more direct stance against fascism and Neo-Nazism, and was criticised for being too preachy.\nAt the 2014 Brit Awards on 19 February, Bowie became the oldest recipient of a Brit Award in the ceremony's history when he won the award for British Male Solo Artist, which was collected on his behalf by Kate Moss. His speech read: \"I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male \u2013 but I am, aren't I Kate? Yes. I think it's a great way to end the day. Thank you very, very much and Scotland stay with us.\" Bowie's reference to the forthcoming September 2014 Scottish independence referendum garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on social media.\nIn 2016, filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said he had wanted to use \"Panic in Detroit\" for his 1998 documentary \"The Big One\". Denied at first, Moore was given the rights after calling Bowie personally, recalling: \"I've read stuff since his death saying that he wasn't that political and he stayed away from politics. But that wasn't the conversation that I had with him.\"\nDeath.\nOn 10 January 2016, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of the album \"Blackstar\", Bowie died of liver cancer in his New York City apartment. He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier but had not made his condition public. The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, who had worked with the singer on his off-Broadway musical \"Lazarus\", explained that Bowie was unable to attend rehearsals due to the progression of the disease. He noted that Bowie had kept working during the illness.\nBowie's producer Tony Visconti wrote:\nFollowing Bowie's death, fans gathered at impromptu street shrines. At the mural of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton, south London, which shows him in his \"Aladdin Sane\" character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. Other memorial sites included Berlin, Los Angeles, and outside his apartment in New York. After news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. Bowie had insisted that he did not want a funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January. As he wished in his will, his ashes were scattered in a Buddhist ceremony in Bali, Indonesia.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nAwards and achievements.\nBowie's 1969 commercial breakthrough, the song \"Space Oddity\", won him an Ivor Novello Special Award For Originality. For his performance in the 1976 science fiction film \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\", he won a Saturn Award for Best Actor. In the ensuing decades he was honoured with numerous awards for his music and its accompanying videos, receiving, among others, six Grammy Awards and four Brit Awards\u2014winning Best British Male Artist twice; the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1996; and the Brits Icon award for his \"lasting impact on British culture\", given posthumously in 2016.\nIn 1999, Bowie was made a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government. He received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music the same year. He declined the royal honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000, and turned down a knighthood in 2003. Bowie later stated \"I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don't know what it's for. It's not what I spent my life working for.\"\nBowie has sold over 100\u00a0million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists. In the United Kingdom, he was awarded 9 platinum, 11 gold, and 8 silver albums, and in the United States, 5 platinum and 9 gold.\nFive of Bowie's albums appear on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Four of Bowie's songs appear on the \"Rolling Stone\" list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Additionally, four of his songs are included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. According to Acclaimed Music, he is the fourth most celebrated artist in popular music history.\nIn the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, he was ranked 29. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him 39th on their list of the 100 Greatest Rock Artists of All Time. Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. He was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2016, \"Rolling Stone\" proclaimed Bowie \"the greatest rock star ever\".\nIn 2008, the spider \"Heteropoda davidbowie\" was named in Bowie's honour. On 5 January 2015, a main-belt asteroid was named 342843 Davidbowie. On 13 January 2016, Belgian amateur astronomers at MIRA Public Observatory created a \"Bowie asterism\" of seven stars which had been in the vicinity of Mars at the time of Bowie's death; the \"constellation\" forms the lightning bolt on Bowie's face from the cover of his \"Aladdin Sane\" album.\nOn 25 March 2018, a statue of Bowie was unveiled in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, the town where he debuted Ziggy Stardust. The statue features a likeness of Bowie in 2002 accompanied with various characters and looks from over his career, with Ziggy at the front."}

{"id": "8791", "revid": "1012943909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8791", "title": "Dennis Hopper", "text": "Dennis Lee Hopper (May 17, 1936 \u2013 May 29, 2010) was an American actor and filmmaker. He attended the Actors Studio, made his first television appearance in 1954, and soon after appeared alongside James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955), and \"Giant\" (1956). In the next ten years he made a name in television, and by the end of the 1960s had appeared in several films, notably \"Cool Hand Luke\" (1967) and \"Hang 'Em High\" (1968). Hopper also began a prolific and acclaimed photography career in the 1960s.\nHopper made his directorial film debut with \"Easy Rider\" (1969), which he and co-star Peter Fonda wrote with Terry Southern. The film earned Hopper a Cannes Film Festival Award for \"Best First Work\" and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (shared with Fonda and Southern). Journalist Ann Hornaday wrote: \"With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, \"Easy Rider\" became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion\". Film critic Matthew Hays wrote \"no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper\".\nFollowing the critical and commercial failure of his second film as director, \"The Last Movie\" (1971), he worked on various independent and foreign projects \u2013 in which he was frequently typecast as mentally disturbed outsiders in such films as \"Mad Dog Morgan\" (1976) and \"The American Friend\" (1977) \u2013 until he found new fame for his role as an American photojournalist in \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979). He went on to helm his third directorial work \"Out of the Blue\" (1980), for which he was again honored at Cannes, and appeared in \"Rumble Fish\" (1983) and \"The Osterman Weekend\" (1983). He saw a career resurgence in 1986 when he was widely acclaimed for his performances in \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Hoosiers\", the latter of which saw him nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His fourth directorial outing came about through \"Colors\" (1988), followed by an Emmy-nominated lead performance in \"Paris Trout\" (1991). In 1990, Dennis Hopper directed \"The Hot Spot,\" which was not a box-office hit. Hopper found greater fame for portraying the villains of the films \"Super Mario Bros.\" (1993), \"Speed\" (1994) and \"Waterworld\" (1995).\nHopper's later work included a leading role in the short-lived television series \"Crash\" (2008\u20132009), inspired by the film of the same name. He appeared in three films released posthumously: \"Alpha and Omega\" (2010), \"The Last Film Festival\" (2016) and the long-delayed \"The Other Side of the Wind\" (2018), which had been filmed in the early 1970s.\nEarly life.\nHopper was born on May 17, 1936, in Dodge City, Kansas, the son of Marjorie Mae (n\u00e9e Davis; July 12, 1917 \u2013 January 12, 2007) and James Millard Hopper (June 23, 1916 \u2013 August 7, 1982). He had Scottish ancestors. Hopper had two brothers, Marvin and David.\nAfter World War II, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where the young Hopper attended Saturday art classes at the Kansas City Art Institute. When he was 13, Hopper and his family moved to San Diego, where his mother worked as a lifeguard instructor and his father was a post office manager, having previously served in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, in World War II. Hopper was voted most likely to succeed at Helix High School, where he was active in the drama club, speech and choir. It was there that he developed an interest in acting, studying at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, and the Actors Studio in New York City (he studied with Lee Strasberg for five years). Hopper struck up a friendship with actor Vincent Price, whose passion for art influenced Hopper's interest in art. He was especially fond of the plays of William Shakespeare.\nCareer.\nFilm.\nHopper was reported to have an uncredited role in \"Johnny Guitar\" in 1954 but he has stated that he was not in Hollywood when this film was made. Hopper made his debut on film in two roles with James Dean (whom he admired immensely) in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955) and \"Giant\" (1956). Dean's death in a car accident in September 1955 affected the young Hopper deeply and it was shortly afterward that he got into a confrontation with veteran director Henry Hathaway on the film \"From Hell to Texas\" (1958). Hopper forced Hathaway to shoot more than 80 takes of a scene over several days before he acquiesced to Hathaway's direction. After filming was finally completed, Hathaway allegedly told Hopper that his career in Hollywood was finished.\nIn his book \"Last Train to Memphis\", American popular music historian Peter Guralnick says that in 1956, when Elvis Presley was making his first film in Hollywood, Hopper was roommates with fellow actor Nick Adams and the three became friends and socialized together. In 1959 Hopper moved to New York to study Method acting under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. In 1961, Hopper played his first lead role in \"Night Tide\", an atmospheric supernatural thriller involving a mermaid in an amusement park.\nIn a December 1994 interview on the \"Charlie Rose Show\", Hopper credited John Wayne with saving his career, as Hopper acknowledged that because of his insolent behavior, he could not find work in Hollywood for seven years. Hopper stated that because he was the son-in-law of actress Margaret Sullavan, a friend of John Wayne, Wayne hired Hopper for a role in \"The Sons of Katie Elder\" (1965), also directed by Hathaway, which enabled Hopper to restart his film career. Hopper acted in another John Wayne film, \"True Grit\" (1969), and during its production, he became well acquainted with Wayne. In both of the films with Wayne, Hopper's character is killed in the presence of Wayne's character, to whom he utters his dying words.\nHopper had a supporting role as the bet-taker, \"Babalugats\", in \"Cool Hand Luke\" (1967). In 1968, Hopper teamed with Peter Fonda, Terry Southern and Jack Nicholson to make \"Easy Rider\", which premiered in July 1969. With the release of \"True Grit\" a month earlier, Hopper had starring roles in two major box office films that summer. Hopper won wide acclaim as the director for his improvisational methods and innovative editing for \"Easy Rider\". The production was plagued by creative differences and personal acrimony between Fonda and Hopper, the dissolution of Hopper's marriage to Hayward, his unwillingness to leave the editor's desk and his accelerating abuse of drugs and alcohol. Hopper said of \"Easy Rider\": \"The cocaine problem in the United States is really because of me. There was no cocaine before Easy Rider on the street. After Easy Rider, it was everywhere\".\nBesides showing drug use on film, it was one of the first films to portray the hippie lifestyle. Hopper became a stereotype for some male youths who rejected traditional jobs and traditional American culture, partly exemplified by Fonda's long sideburns and Hopper wearing shoulder-length hair and a long mustache. They were denied rooms in motels and proper service in restaurants as a result of their radical looks. Their long hair became a point of contention in various scenes during the film.\nHopper was unable to capitalize on his \"Easy Rider\" success for several years. In 1970 he filmed \"The Last Movie\", cowritten by Stewart Stern and photographed by Laszlo Kovacs in Peru, and completed production in 1971. It won the prestigious CIDALC Award at that year's Venice Film Festival, but Universal Studios leaders expected a blockbuster like \"Easy Rider\", and did not like the film or give it an enthusiastic release, while American film audiences found it confounding \u2013 as convoluted as an abstract painting. On viewing the first release print, fresh from the lab, in his screening room at Universal, MCA founder Jules Stein rose from his chair and said, \"I just don't understand this younger generation.\" During the tumultuous editing process, Hopper ensconced himself at the Mabel Dodge Luhan House in Taos, New Mexico, which he had purchased in 1970, for almost an entire year. In between contesting Fonda's rights to the majority of the residual profits from \"Easy Rider\", he married singer Michelle Phillips of The Mamas and the Papas on Halloween of 1970. The marriage lasted eight days.\nHopper was able to sustain his lifestyle and a measure of celebrity by acting in numerous low budget and European films throughout the 1970s as the archetypal \"tormented maniac\", including \"Mad Dog Morgan\" (1976), \"Tracks\" (1976), and \"The American Friend\" (1977). With Francis Ford Coppola's blockbuster \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979), Hopper returned to prominence as a hyper-manic Vietnam-era photojournalist. Stepping in for an overwhelmed director, Hopper won praise in 1980 for his directing and acting in \"Out of the Blue\". Immediately thereafter, Hopper starred as an addled short-order cook \"Cracker\" in the Neil Young/Dean Stockwell low-budget collaboration \"Human Highway\". Production was reportedly often delayed by his unreliable behavior. Peter Biskind states in the New Hollywood history \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\" that Hopper's cocaine intake had reached three grams a day by this time, complemented by 30 beers, and some marijuana and Cuba libres.\nAfter staging a \"suicide attempt\" (really more of a daredevil act) in a coffin using 17 sticks of dynamite during an \"art happening\" at the Rice University Media Center (filmed by professor and documentary filmmaker Brian Huberman), and later disappearing into the Mexican desert during a particularly extravagant bender, Hopper entered a drug rehabilitation program in 1983.\nThough Hopper gave critically acclaimed performances in Coppola's \"Rumble Fish\" (1983) and Sam Peckinpah's \"The Osterman Weekend\" (1983), it was not until he portrayed the gas-huffing, obscenity-screaming villain Frank Booth in David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) that his career truly revived. On reading the script Hopper said to Lynch: \"You have to let me play Frank Booth. Because I am Frank Booth!\" He won critical acclaim and several awards for this role, and in the same year received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an alcoholic assistant basketball coach in \"Hoosiers\". Also in 1986, Hopper portrayed Lt. Enright in the comedy horror \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\". In 1988, he directed \"Colors\", a critically acclaimed police procedural about gang violence in Los Angeles starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall.\nHopper kind of plays himself as an aging hippie prankster in the 1990 comedy \"Flashback\", fleeing in a \"Furthur\"-like old bus to the tune of Steppenwolf's Born to Be Wild. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for the 1991 HBO film \"Paris Trout\". Shortly thereafter, he played drug smuggler and DEA informant Barry Seal in the HBO film \"Doublecrossed\". He starred as King Koopa in \"Super Mario Bros.\", a 1993 critical and commercial failure loosely based on the video game of the same name. In 1993, he played Clifford Worley in \"True Romance\". He co-starred in the 1994 blockbuster \"Speed\" with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, and as magic-phobic H.P. Lovecraft in the TV movie \"Witch Hunt\".\nIn 1995, Hopper played a greedy TV self-help guru, Dr. Luther Waxling in \"Search and Destroy\". The same year, he starred as Deacon, the one-eyed nemesis of Kevin Costner in \"Waterworld\". And in 1996 he starred in the science fiction comedy \"Space Truckers\" directed by Stuart Gordon. In 1999, he starred in The Prophet's Game (a dark thriller), Directed by David Worth and also starring Stephanie Zimbalist, Robert Yocum, Sandra Locke, Joe Penny and Tracey Birdsall. In 2003, Hopper was in the running for the dual lead in the indie horror drama \"Firecracker\", but was ousted at the last minute in favor of Mike Patton. In 2005, Hopper played Paul Kaufman in George A. Romero's \"Land of the Dead\". In 2008, Hopper starred in \"An American Carol\". In 2008 he also played The Death in Wim Wenders' \"Palermo Shooting\". His last major feature film appearance was in the 2008 film \"Elegy\" with Ben Kingsley, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Debbie Harry. For his last performance, he was the voice of Tony, the alpha-male of the Eastern wolf pack inside the 2010 3D computer animated film \"Alpha and Omega\". He died before the movie was released. This brought the directors to dedicate the film to his memory at the beginning of the movie credits.\nHopper filmed scenes for \"The Other Side of the Wind\" in 1971, appearing as himself; after decades of legal, financial and technical delays, the film was finally released on Netflix in 2018.\nTelevision.\nHopper debuted in an episode of the Richard Boone television series \"Medic\" in 1955, portraying a young epileptic.\nHe appeared as an arrogant young gunfighter, the Utah Kid, in the 1956 episode \"Quicksand\" of the first hour-long western television series \"Cheyenne\", starring Clint Walker. In the storyline, the Kid gave Cheyenne Bodie no choice but to kill him in a gunfight. In 1957 Hopper played thief Abe Larson in another \"Cheyenne\" episode titled \"The Iron Trail.\" In 1957, he played Billy the Kid on the episode \"Brannigan's Boots\" of \"Sugarfoot\" with Will Hutchins.\nHe appeared in the very first episode of the popular TV series, \"The Rifleman\" (1958\u20131963) as protagonist Vernon Tippet. The series starred Chuck Connors and the premiere episode \"The Sharpshooter\" was written by Sam Peckinpah.\nHe subsequently appeared in over 140 episodes of television shows such as \"Gunsmoke\", \"Bonanza\", \"Petticoat Junction\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"The Barbara Stanwyck Show\", \"The Defenders\", \"The Investigators\", \"The Legend of Jesse James\", \"Entourage\", \"The Big Valley\", \"The Time Tunnel\", and \"Combat!\".\nOn 30 September 1970, Hopper appeared on the season 2-second episode of \"The Johnny Cash Show\" where he sang a duet with Cash entitled \"Goin' Up Goin' Down\". Cash said the song was written by Kris Kristofferson about Hopper. Hopper added that Kristofferson had written some songs for his Peruvian-shot movie \"The Last Movie\", in which Kristofferson appeared in his debut role with Julie Adams. j Hopper also recited Rudyard Kipling's famous poem If\u2014 during his appearance.\nHopper teamed with Nike in the early 1990s to make a series of television commercials. He appeared as a \"crazed referee\" in those ads. He portrayed villain Victor Drazen in the first season of the popular action drama \"24\".\nHopper appeared on the final two episodes of the cult 1991 television show \"Fishing with John\" with host \"John Lurie\".\nHopper starred as a U.S. Army colonel in the 2005 television series \"E-Ring\", a drama set at The Pentagon, but the series was canceled after 14 episodes aired. Hopper appeared in all 22 episodes that were filmed. He also played the part of record producer Ben Cendars in the Starz television series \"Crash\", which lasted two seasons (26 episodes).\nPhotography and art.\nHopper had several artistic pursuits beyond film. He was a prolific photographer, painter, and sculptor.\nHopper's fascination with art began with painting lessons at the Nelson-Atkins Museum while still a child in Kansas City, Missouri. Early in his career, he painted and wrote poetry, though many of his works were destroyed in the 1961 Bel Air fire, which burned hundreds of homes, including his and his wife's, on Stone Canyon Road in Bel Air. His painting style ranges from abstract impressionism to photorealism and often includes references to his cinematic work and to other artists.\nOstracized by the Hollywood film studios due to his reputation for being a \"difficult\" actor, Hopper turned to photography in 1961 with a camera bought for him by his first wife Brooke Hayward. During this period he created the cover art for the Ike &amp; Tina Turner album \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\" (released in 1966). He became a prolific photographer, and noted writer Terry Southern profiled Hopper in \"Better Homes and Gardens\" as an up-and-coming photographer \"to watch\" in the mid-1960s. Hopper's early photography is known for portraits from the 1960s, and he began shooting portraits for \"Vogue\" and other magazines. His photographs of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 1963 March on Washington and the 1965 civil-rights march in Selma, Alabama, were published. His intimate and unguarded images of Andy Warhol, Jane Fonda, The Byrds, Paul Newman, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, James Brown, Peter Fonda, Ed Ruscha, the Grateful Dead, Michael McClure, and Timothy Leary, among others, became the subject of gallery and museum shows and were collected in several books, including \"1712 North Crescent Heights.\" The book, whose title refers to the house where he lived with Hayward in the Hollywood Hills in the 1960s, was edited by his daughter Marin Hopper. In 1960\u201367, before the making of \"Easy Rider\", Hopper created 18,000 images that chronicled the remarkable artists, musicians, actors places, happenings, demonstrations, and concerts of that period. \"Dennis Hopper: Photographs 1961\u20131967\" was published in February 2011, by Taschen. German film director Wim Wenders said of Hopper that if \u201che\u2019d only been a photographer, he\u2019d be one of the great photographers of the twentieth century.\u201d In The New Yorker, Hopper, as photographer, was described as\n\"a compelling, important, and weirdly omnipresent chronicler of his times.\"\nHopper began working as a painter and a poet as well as a collector of art in the 1960s as well, particularly Pop Art. Over his lifetime he amassed a formidable array of 20th- and 21st-century art, including many of Julian Schnabel's works (such as a shattered-plate portrait of Hopper); numerous works from his early cohorts, such as Ed Ruscha, Edward Kienholz, Roy Lichtenstein (\"Sinking Sun\", 1964), and Warhol (\"Double Mona Lisa\", 1963); and pieces by contemporary artists such as Damien Hirst and Robin Rhode. He was involved in L.A.'s Ferus and Virginia Dwan galleries in the 1960s, and he was a longtime friend and supporter to New York dealer Tony Shafrazi. One of the first art works Hopper owned was an early print of Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans bought for US$75. Hopper also once owned Warhol's \"Mao\", which he shot one evening in a fit of paranoia, the two bullet holes possibly adding to the print's value. The print sold at Christie's, New York, for US$302,500 in January 2011. The proceeds of the two-day sale of some 300 pieces from Hopper's collection at Christie's went to his four children.\nDuring his lifetime, Hopper's own work as well as his collection was shown in monographic and group exhibitions around the world including the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg; MAK Vienna: Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art, Vienna; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, Paris, and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne. In March 2010, it was announced that Hopper was on the \"short list\" for Jeffrey Deitch's inaugural show at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). In April 2010, Deitch confirmed that Hopper's work, curated by Julian Schnabel, will indeed be the focus of his debut at MOCA. The title of the exhibition, \"Double Standard\", was taken from Hopper's iconic 1961 photograph of the two Standard Oil signs seen through an automobile windshield at the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard, Melrose Avenue, and North Doheny Drive on historic Route 66 in Los Angeles. The image was reproduced on the invitation for Ed Ruscha's second solo exhibition at Ferus Gallery in 1964.\nIn 2011, Barricade Books published film historian Peter L. Winkler's biography, \"Dennis Hopper: The Wild Ride of a Hollywood Rebel\". In 2013, Harper Collins published \"Hopper: A Journey into the American Dream\", a biography by American writer Tom Folsom.\nOn the Gorillaz album \"Demon Days\", Hopper narrates the song \"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\".\nIn the late 1980s, Hopper purchased a trio of nearly identical two-story, loft-style condominiums at 330 Indiana Avenue in Venice Beach, California \u2013 one made of concrete, one of plywood, and one of green roofing shingles \u2013 built by Frank Gehry and two artist friends of Hopper's, Chuck Arnoldi and Laddie John Dill, in 1981. In 1987, he commissioned an industrial-style main residence, with a corrugated metal exterior designed by Brian Murphy, as a place to display his artwork.\nPersonal life.\nAccording to \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Hopper was \"one of Hollywood's most notorious drug addicts\" for 20 years. He spent much of the 1970s and early 1980s living as an \"outcast\" in Taos, New Mexico after the success of \"Easy Rider\". Hopper was also \"notorious for his troubled relationships with women\", including Michelle Phillips, who divorced him after eight days of marriage. Hopper was married five times:\nHopper has been widely reported to be the godfather of actress Amber Tamblyn; in a 2009 interview with \"Parade\", Tamblyn explained that \"godfather\" was \"just a loose term\" for Hopper, Dean Stockwell and Neil Young, three famous friends of her father's, who were always around the house when she was growing up, and who were big influences on her life.\nIn 1994, Rip Torn filed a defamation lawsuit against Hopper over a story Hopper told on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\". Hopper claimed that Torn pulled a knife on him during pre-production of the film \"Easy Rider\". According to Hopper, Torn was originally cast in the film but was replaced with Jack Nicholson after the incident. According to Torn's suit, it was actually Hopper who pulled the knife on him. A judge ruled in Torn's favor and Hopper was ordered to pay US$475,000 in damages. Hopper then appealed but the judge again ruled in Torn's favor and Hopper was required to pay another US$475,000 in punitive damages.\nAccording to Newsmeat, Hopper donated US$2,000 to the Republican National Committee in 2004 and an equal amount in 2005.\nHopper was honored with the rank of commander of France's National Order of Arts and Letters, at a ceremony in Paris.\nDespite being a Republican, Hopper supported Barack Obama in the 2008 US Presidential election. Hopper confirmed this in an election day appearance on the ABC daytime show \"The View\". He said his reason for not voting Republican was the selection of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice presidential candidate.\nDivorce from Victoria Duffy.\nOn January 14, 2010, Hopper filed for divorce from his fifth wife Victoria Duffy. After citing her \"outrageous conduct\" and stating she was \"insane\", \"inhuman\" and \"volatile\", Hopper was granted a restraining order against her on February 11, 2010, and as a result, she was forbidden to come within of him or contact him. On March 9, 2010, Duffy refused to move out of the Hopper home, despite the court's order that she do so by March 15.\nOn March 23, 2010, he filed papers in court alleging Duffy had absconded with US$1.5\u00a0million of his art, refused his requests to return it, and then had \"left town\".\nOn April 5, 2010, a court ruled that Duffy could continue living on Hopper's property, and that he must pay US$12,000 per month spousal and child support for their daughter Galen. Hopper did not attend the hearing. On May 12, 2010, a hearing was held before Judge Amy Pellman in downtown Los Angeles Superior Court. Though Hopper died two weeks later, Duffy insisted at the hearing that he was well enough to be deposed. The hearing also dealt with whom to designate on Hopper's life insurance policy, which listed his wife as a beneficiary. A very ill Hopper did not appear in court though his estranged wife did. Despite Duffy's bid to be named the sole beneficiary of Hopper's million-dollar policy, the judge ruled against her and limited her claim to one-quarter of the policy. The remaining US$750,000 was to go to his estate.\nOn November 14, 2010, it was revealed that, despite Duffy's earlier assertion in her court papers of February 2010 that Hopper was mentally incompetent, and that his children had rewritten his estate plan in order to leave Duffy and her daughter, Hopper's youngest child Galen, destitute, Galen would in fact receive the proceeds of 40% of his estate.\nIllness and death.\nOn September 28, 2009, Hopper, then 73, was reportedly brought by ambulance to an unidentified Manhattan hospital wearing an oxygen mask and \"with numerous tubes visible\". On October 2, he was discharged, after receiving treatment for dehydration.\nOn October 29, Hopper's manager Sam Maydew reported that he had been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. In January 2010, it was reported that Hopper's cancer had metastasized to his bones.\nOn March 18, 2010, he was honored with the 2,403rd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of Grauman's Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Surrounded by friends including Jack Nicholson, Viggo Mortensen, David Lynch, Michael Madsen, family and fans, he attended its addition to the sidewalk six days later.\nBy March 2010, Hopper reportedly weighed only and was unable to carry on long conversations. According to papers filed in his divorce court case, Hopper was terminally ill and was unable to undergo chemotherapy to treat his prostate cancer.\nHopper died at his home in the coastal Venice district of Los Angeles, aged 74, on the morning of May 29, 2010. His funeral took place on June 3, 2010, at San Francisco de Asis Mission Church in Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico. His body was buried at the Jesus Nazareno Cemetery in Ranchos de Taos.\nThe film \"Alpha and Omega\", which was among his last film roles, was dedicated to him as was the 2011 film \"Restless\", which starred his son Henry Hopper.\nArchive.\nThe moving image collection of Dennis Hopper is held at the Academy Film Archive. The Dennis Hopper Trust Collection represents Hopper's directorial efforts."}

The Red Wings compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division, and are one of the Original Six teams of the league. Founded in 1926, the team was known as the Detroit Cougars until 1930. For the 1930\u201331 and 1931\u201332 seasons the team was called the Detroit Falcons, and in 1932 changed their name to the Red Wings.\n, the Red Wings have won the most Stanley Cup championships of any NHL franchise based in the United States (11) and are third overall in total Stanley Cup championships, behind the Montreal Canadiens (24) and Toronto Maple Leafs (13). The Wings played their home games at Joe Louis Arena from 1979 until 2017, after playing for 52 years in Olympia Stadium. They moved into the new Little Caesars Arena beginning with the 2017\u201318 season.\nThe Red Wings are one of the most popular and successful franchises in the NHL; fans and sports commentators refer to the Detroit area as \"Hockeytown\", which has been a registered trademark owned by the franchise since 1996.\nBetween the 1931\u201332 and 1965\u201366 seasons, the Red Wings missed the playoffs only four times. Between the 1966\u201367 and 1982\u201383 seasons, the Red Wings made the playoffs only two times. However, thereafter, from 1983\u201384 to 2015\u201316, they made the playoffs 30 times in 32 seasons, including 25-straight from 1990\u201391 to 2015\u201316 (not counting the cancelled 2004\u201305 season), in 2006 this became the longest active streak of postseason appearances in all of North American professional sports and finished tied for the third longest streak in NHL history. Since 1983\u201384, the Red Wings have tallied six regular season first-place finishes and have won the Stanley Cup four times (1997, 1998, 2002, and 2008), all within an eleven year span.\nFranchise history.\nEarly years (1926\u20131949).\nFollowing the 1926 Stanley Cup playoffs, during which the Western Hockey League (WHL) was widely reported to be on the verge of folding, the NHL held a meeting on April 17 to consider applications for expansion franchises, at which it was reported that five different groups sought a team for Detroit. During a subsequent meeting on May 15, the league approved a franchise to the Townsend-Seyburn group of Detroit and named Charles A. Hughes as governor. Frank and Lester Patrick, the owners of the WHL, made a deal to sell the league's players to the NHL and cease league operations. The new Detroit franchise purchased the players of the WHL's Victoria Cougars, who had won the Stanley Cup in 1925 and had made the Finals the previous winter, to play for the team. The new Detroit franchise also adopted the Cougars' nickname in honor of the folded franchise.\nSince no arena in Detroit was ready at the time, the Cougars played their first season at the Border Cities Arena in Windsor, Ontario. For the 1927\u201328 season, the Cougars moved into the new Detroit Olympia, which would be their home rink until December 15, 1979. This was also the first season behind the bench for Jack Adams, who would be the face of the franchise for the next 36 years as either coach or general manager.\nThe Cougars made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in 1929 with Carson Cooper leading the team in scoring. The Cougars were outscored 7\u20132 in the two-game series with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 1930, the Cougars were renamed the Falcons, but their woes continued, as they usually finished near the bottom of the standings, even though they made the playoffs again in 1932.\nIn 1932, the NHL let grain merchant James E. Norris, who had made two previous unsuccessful bids to buy an NHL team, purchase the Falcons. Norris' first act was to choose a new name for the team\u2014the Red Wings. Earlier in the century, Norris had been a member of the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association (MAAA), a multi-sport club whose winged-wheel emblem derived from its cycling roots, and whose hockey team won the first Stanley Cup in 1893. Norris decided that a red version of the MAAA \"Winged Wheelers\" logo was perfect for a team playing in the \"Motor City\" and on October 5, 1932, the club was renamed the Red Wings. Norris also placed coach Jack Adams on a one-year probation for the 1932\u201333 NHL season. Adams managed to pass his probationary period by leading the renamed franchise to its first-ever playoff series victory, over the Montreal Maroons. The team then lost in the semi-finals to the New York Rangers.\nIn 1934, the Red Wings made the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time, with John Sorrell scoring 21 goals over 47 games and Larry Aurie leading the team in scoring. However, the Chicago Black Hawks defeated the Red Wings in the Finals, winning the best-of-five series in four games to claim their first title. Two seasons later, the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 1936, defeating Toronto in four games. Detroit repeated as Stanley Cup champions in 1937, winning over the Rangers in the full five games. In 1938, the Montreal Canadiens and the Red Wings became the first NHL teams to play in Europe, playing in Paris and London. The Wings played nine games against the Canadiens and went 3\u20135\u20131. They did not play in Europe again until the pre-season and start of the 2009\u201310 NHL season, in Sweden, against the St. Louis Blues.\nThe Red Wings made the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive years during the early 1940s. In 1941, they were swept by the Boston Bruins, and in 1942, they lost a seven-game series to Toronto after winning the first three games. However, in 1943, with Mud Bruneteau and Syd Howe scoring 23 and 20 goals, respectively, Detroit won their third Stanley Cup by sweeping the Bruins. Through the rest of the decade, the team made the playoffs every year, and reached the Finals three more times.\nIn 1946, one of the greatest players in hockey history came into the NHL with the Red Wings. Gordie Howe, a right winger from Floral, Saskatchewan, only scored seven goals and 15 assists in his first season and would not reach his prime for a few more years. It was also the last season as head coach for Adams, who stepped down after the season to concentrate on his duties as general manager. He was succeeded by minor league coach Tommy Ivan. By his second season, Howe was paired with Sid Abel and Ted Lindsay to form what would become one of the great lines in NHL history: the \"Production Line\". Lindsay's 33 goals propelled the Red Wings to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were swept by the Maple Leafs. Detroit reached the Finals again the following season, only to be swept again by Toronto.\nGordie Howe era (1950\u20131966).\nDuring the 1950 Stanley Cup semi-finals, Leo Reise Jr. scored the winning goal in overtime, which prevented the Maple Leafs from winning four straight championships. In the Finals, the Red Wings defeated the New York Rangers in seven games. In Game 7, Pete Babando scored the game winner in double overtime. After the game, Lindsay skated around the Olympia ice with the Stanley Cup.\nAfter being upset by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1951 semi-finals, Detroit won its fifth Stanley Cup, in 1952, sweeping both the Maple Leafs and the Canadiens, with the Production Line of Howe, Abel and Lindsay joined by second-year goaltender Terry Sawchuk. Detroit became the first team in 17 years to go undefeated in the playoffs. They also scored 24 playoff goals, compared to Toronto and Montreal's combined total of 5. Abel left the Red Wings for Chicago during the off-season, and his spot on the roster was replaced by Alex Delvecchio. In December 1952, James E. Norris died. He was succeeded as team president by his daughter, Marguerite, which made her the first woman to head an NHL franchise.\nFollowing another playoff upset in 1953 at the hands of the Bruins, the Red Wings won back-to-back Stanley Cups, beating the rival powerhouse Montreal Canadiens. Both of the Stanley Cup Finals played between the two teams were decided in seven games. The seventh game during the 1954 Stanley Cup Finals was won with one of the oddest cup winning goals ever, when the 5'7\" left winger Tony Leswick, known more for his relentless checking than scoring prowess, shot a puck towards the Montreal goal from the middle of the ice. Habs defenseman Doug Harvey tried to gain control of the wobbly puck with his glove, but instead redirected it past Montreal goalie Gerry McNeil. The repeat of the series the season after was closely contested, as all of the games were won by the home team, with Detroit taking the seventh game. Montreal was sorely lacking its all-star Maurice Richard, who was suspended after hitting a linesman during the regular season, and the Red Wings' stars carried their team, as Lindsay scored four goals in a single game and Howe scored 20 points during the playoffs, 12 of which during the Finals, all new records in the league.\nThe 1954\u201355 season ended a run of seven straight regular season titles, an NHL record. During the 1955 offseason, Marguerite Norris lost an intra-family power struggle, and was forced to turn over the Red Wings to her younger brother Bruce. Detroit and Montreal once again met, in the 1956 Stanley Cup Finals, but this time the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup, their first of five in a row. In 1957, Lindsay, who had scored 30 goals and led the league in assists with 55, teamed up with Harvey to help start the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA). As a result, he and goaltender Glenn Hall were promptly traded to Chicago.\nIn 1959, the Red Wings missed the playoffs for the first time in 21 years. However, within a couple of years, the franchise was able to rejuvenate itself. The Red Wings made the Finals in four of the next six years between 1961 and 1966. However, they came away empty-handed.\n\"Dead Wings\" era (1967\u20131982).\nOnly a year after making the Finals, the Red Wings finished a distant fifth, 24 points out of the playoffs. It was the beginning of a slump that they would not emerge from in almost 20 years. This period is derisively known as the \"Dead Wings\" era.\nOne factor in the Red Wings' decline was the end of the old development system. Another factor was Ned Harkness, who was hired as coach in 1970 and was promoted to general manager midway through the season. A successful college hockey coach, Harkness tried to force his two-way style of play on a veteran Red Wings team resistant to change. They chafed under his rule in which he demanded short hair and no smoking, and put other rules in place regarding drinking and phone calls. Harkness was forced to resign in 1974, ending the period colloquially referred to as \"Darkness with Harkness\".\nIn the expansion season of 1967\u201368, the Red Wings acquired longtime star left-winger Frank Mahovlich from the defending Cup champions in Toronto. Mahovlich would go on a line with Howe and Delvecchio, and in 1968\u201369, he scored a career-high 49 goals and had two All-Star seasons in Detroit. However, Mahovlich was traded to Montreal in 1971, while Howe announced his retirement in the same year. Throughout the decade, the Red Wings were hampered due to a number of factors.\nDuring the 1979\u201380 season, the Red Wings left the Olympia for Joe Louis Arena. In 1982, after 50 years of family ownership, Bruce Norris sold the Red Wings to Mike Ilitch, founder of Little Caesars.\nSteve Yzerman era (1983\u20132006).\nIn 1983, the Red Wings drafted Steve Yzerman, a center from the Peterborough Petes, with their first-round pick. He led the team in scoring in his rookie year. That season, with John Ogrodnick, Ivan Boldirev, Ron Duguay, and Brad Park, Detroit made the playoffs for the first time in six years. Park ended up winning the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. Park was later asked to coach the Red Wings, only to be sacked after just 45 games in 1985\u201386. They ended up in last place with a 17\u201357\u20136 record for only 40 points. This was the same year that the Red Wings added enforcer Bob Probert, one of the most familiar faces of the team in the 1980s and 1990s.\nIn the 1986\u201387 season, with Yzerman, now the captain following the departure of Danny Gare, joined by Petr Klima, Adam Oates, Gerard Gallant, defenseman Darren Veitch and new head coach Jacques Demers, the Red Wings won a playoff series for only the second time in the modern era. They made it all the way to the conference finals against the powerful Edmonton Oilers, but lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champions in five games. In 1988, they won their first division title in 23 years. They did so, however, in a relatively weak division, as no other team in the Norris finished above .500. As was the case in the previous season, they made it to the conference finals only to lose again to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Oilers in five games.\nIn 1989, Yzerman scored a career-best 65 goals, but Detroit was upset in the first round by the Chicago Blackhawks. The following season, Yzerman scored 62 goals, but the team missed the playoffs.\nAfter the season, Demers was fired and was replaced by Bryan Murray as the new head coach. Murray was unable to get them back over .500, but they returned to the playoffs. Yzerman was joined by Sergei Fedorov, who would be an award-winner and frequent all-star for the team in the 1990s. In 1991, the team signed free agent Ray Sheppard, who would score a career-best 52 goals three years later. In 1993, the Red Wings acquired top defenseman Paul Coffey. Also joining the Red Wings around this time were draft picks Vladimir Konstantinov, Nicklas Lidstrom, Vyacheslav Kozlov, Darren McCarty and Chris Osgood.\nThe Russian Five and back-to-back Stanley Cups (1994\u20131998).\nIn 1993, former Montreal Canadiens coach Scotty Bowman was hired as the new head coach. In his second season, the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 NHL season, Bowman guided Detroit to its first Finals appearance in 29 years, only to be swept by the New Jersey Devils.\nDuring the 1995\u201396 season, they won an NHL record 62 games. After defeating the St. Louis Blues in seven games, the Red Wings would fall in the Western Conference finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche.\nThe following season, the Red Wings acquired Brendan Shanahan and Larry Murphy. In the playoffs, they would defeat the St. Louis Blues, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Avalanche in the first three rounds. In the Finals, the Red Wings swept the Philadelphia Flyers. It was their first Stanley Cup since 1955, breaking the longest drought (42 years long) in the league at that time. Mike Vernon was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nMisfortune befell the Red Wings six days after their championship; defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, one of the members of the \"Russian Five\", suffered a brain injury in a limousine accident, and his career came to an abrupt end. As a result, the team dedicated the 1997\u201398 season to him. The Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in four games, this time over the Washington Capitals, and Konstantinov was brought onto the ice in his wheelchair so he could touch it.\nSuperstar acquisitions and more success (1999\u20132006).\nThe following season, the Red Wings appeared to be poised to win a third consecutive Stanley Cup when they acquired three-time top blueliner Chris Chelios from his hometown Chicago Blackhawks in March 1999. Also acquired at the trade deadline were defenseman Ulf Samuelsson, winger Wendel Clark, and goaltender Bill Ranford. Despite high aspirations, however, Detroit would end up losing in the Western Conference semi-finals to Colorado in six games. In 2000, the Red Wings would finish second in the Central Division. Just like the previous season, however, they would lose to the Avalanche in the Western Conference semi-finals.\nIn 2001, Detroit, the NHL's second-best team in the regular season, were upset in the playoffs by the Los Angeles Kings. During the ensuing offseason, the team acquired goaltender Dominik Hasek (the defending Vezina Trophy winner) and forwards Luc Robitaille and Brett Hull. Russian prospect Pavel Datsyuk also joined the team. Strengthened by the additions, the Red Wings posted the league's best record in the 2001\u201302 regular season and defeated Colorado in seven games in the Western Conference finals after beating the Vancouver Canucks and St. Louis Blues in rounds one and two. The Red Wings then went on to capture another Stanley Cup, in five games, over the Carolina Hurricanes, with Nicklas Lidstrom winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs' MVP. Bowman and Hasek both retired after the season.\nThe off-season saw the Red Wings promote associate coach Dave Lewis to the head coach position after Bowman's retirement. In the market for a new starting goaltender after Hasek's retirement, they signed Curtis Joseph from the Toronto Maple Leafs to a three-year, $24\u00a0million deal. Also new to the lineup was highly-touted Swedish prospect Henrik Zetterberg. The Red Wings finished the season second in the Western Conference, which pitted them in the 2003 playoffs against the seventh-seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Mighty Ducks shocked the hockey world when they swept the Red Wings in four games en route to a Finals appearance.\nIn the offseason, long time Red Wing Fedorov signed with the Mighty Ducks as a free agent. Additionally, Hasek opted to come out of retirement and join the Red Wings for the 2003\u201304 season. Joseph, despite being one of the highest-paid players in the NHL, spent part of the season in the minor leagues. Hasek himself would be sidelined with a groin injury. Notwithstanding, the Red Wings would finish atop of the Central Division and the NHL standings. The Red Wings eliminated the Nashville Predators in six games in the first round of the 2004 playoffs, which led to a second round match-up with the Calgary Flames. The teams split the first four games, and headed to Detroit for a pivotal Game 5, which the Red Wings lost 1\u20130. They were then eliminated two nights later in Calgary by the same score in overtime. The Red Wings did not play in the 2004\u201305 season due to the lockout, which cancelled the entire NHL season.\nOn July 15, 2005, Mike Babcock, former head coach in Anaheim, became the new head coach for the Red Wings. On November 21, 2005, defenseman Jiri Fischer went into cardiac arrest and collapsed on the bench during a game against the Nashville Predators. The game was cancelled because of his injury and was made up on January 23, 2006. This was the first time in NHL history a game had been postponed due to an injury. While the game was played for the full 60 minutes, the Predators were allowed to maintain their 1\u20130 lead from the original game and won 3\u20132. The Red Wings won the Presidents' Trophy with a 58\u201316\u20138 record, earning them 124 points and secured home ice advantage for the entire playoffs. They opened the 2006 playoffs against the Edmonton Oilers with a 3\u20132 overtime victory at Joe Louis Arena, but the Oilers won four of the next five games to take the series.\nContinuing the shakeup of the Red Wings roster, the offseason saw the departure of Brendan Shanahan, the return of Dominik Hasek and the retirement of Steve Yzerman. Yzerman retired with the additional distinction of having been the longest-serving team captain in NHL history.\nNicklas Lidstrom and the \"Euro-Twins\" era (2006\u20132012).\nThe Red Wings opened the 2006\u201307 season with Nicklas Lidstrom as the new captain. The team retired Yzerman's jersey number 19 on January 2, 2007. The Red Wings finished first in the Western Conference and tied for first in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres, but the Sabres were awarded the Presidents' Trophy because they had more wins. Detroit advanced to the third round of the 2007 playoffs after defeating Calgary and the San Jose Sharks both in six games, coming back to win three-straight after the Sharks had a 2\u20131 series lead. The Red Wings would then lose to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Anaheim Ducks in the Western Conference finals in six games.\nTo start the 2007\u201308 campaign, Zetterberg recorded at least a point in each of Detroit's first 17 games, setting a club record. The Wings cruised to the playoffs, where they faced the Nashville Predators. After goaltender Dominik Hasek played poorly in Games 3 and 4 of the series, both losses, head coach Mike Babcock replaced him with Chris Osgood. Osgood never left the net for the remainder of the playoffs, as the Red Wings came back in that series on their way to winning their 11th Stanley Cup. The final victory came in Game 6 on June 4, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, 3\u20132. This was the Red Wings' fourth Stanley Cup in 11 years. Zetterberg scored the winning goal in the decisive game, and was also named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs. It was the first time a team captained by a non-North American player (Lidstrom) won the Stanley Cup.\nOn July 2, 2008, the Red Wings announced the signing of Marian Hossa. On January 1, 2009, the Red Wings played the Chicago Blackhawks in the second NHL Winter Classic at Chicago's Wrigley Field, defeating them 6\u20134. Although they finished second in the conference to the San Jose Sharks, the Wings became the first team in NHL history to top 100 points in nine straight seasons. In the playoffs, the Red Wings swept the Columbus Blue Jackets, then defeated the eighth-seeded Anaheim Ducks in a hard-fought seven game series. They took on the vastly improved Chicago Blackhawks in the conference finals, winning in five games. The Red Wings would face the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Finals for a second consecutive year, but this series would feature a different outcome as the Penguins defeated the Red Wings in seven games. The Red Wings became only the second NHL team to lose the Stanley Cup at home in Game 7.\nThe Red Wings began the 2009\u201310 NHL season in Stockholm, losing both games to the St. Louis Blues 4\u20133 and 5\u20133, respectively. They were plagued by injuries throughout the season and lost the second most man games to injury, with only the last place Edmonton Oilers losing more. The beginning of the season was a struggle for the Red Wings, with key players out of the lineup, including Zetterberg, Tomas Holmstrom, Johan Franzen, Valtteri Filppula and Niklas Kronwall. After the Olympic break, Detroit posted a record of 13\u20133\u20132 and earned 28 points, the most by any team in the NHL. This run helped them secure the fifth playoff seed in the Western Conference. Detroit won their first-round playoff series over the Phoenix Coyotes in seven games. In the second round, they would be defeated by the San Jose Sharks in five games.\nA healthier Red Wings team finished the 2010\u201311 NHL season with a 47\u201325\u201310 record and 104 points to win the Central Division title. They once again faced the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round of the playoffs, this time sweeping them 4\u20130. The Red Wings then went go to face the Sharks in round two. After losing the first three games of the series, the Red Wings won three consecutive games to force a Game 7, becoming just the eighth team in NHL history to accomplish the feat. The Red Wings lost Game 7 to the Sharks by a score of 3\u20132 and were eliminated.\nDuring the 2011 off-season, Red Wings defenseman Brian Rafalski retired. Detroit soon signed free agent defenseman Ian White to take his place. Long-time Red Wings Chris Osgood and Kris Draper also announced their retirement from hockey, with both soon taking positions within the club. Detroit signed goaltender Ty Conklin for his second stint with the team. Tragedy struck the organization and the rest of the NHL upon the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash, which killed former Red Wings assistant coach Brad McCrimmon and defenseman Ruslan Salei, who had joined the KHL team during the summer. Stefan Liv, a former Red Wings goaltending prospect, was also among the fatalities. The Red Wings then added a patch to the left arm of their uniforms with the trio's initials.\nDuring the season, the Red Wings won an NHL-record 23 consecutive home games. The Red Wings also made the NHL playoffs, extending their streak of 21-straight playoff appearances, as the fifth seed. They were defeated in five games by their opening round opponent, the Nashville Predators. On May 31, 2012, Nicklas Lidstrom retired.\nThe final seasons at Joe Louis Arena (2012\u20132017).\nZetterberg was named successor to Lidstrom as team captain. On July 1, 2012, the first day of the NHL free agency period, the Red Wings signed Swiss forward Damien Brunner to a one-year, entry-level contract; forward Jordin Tootoo to a three-year, $5.7\u00a0million contract; and goaltender Jonas Gustavsson to a two-year, $3\u00a0million deal.\nThe team won their final four games of the 2012\u201313 season to earn the seventh seed of the playoffs. The Red Wings' 3\u20130 victory over the Dallas Stars on April 27, 2013 preserved their streak of 22 consecutive playoff appearances. As the seventh seed in the 2013 playoffs, the Red Wings faced the second-seeded Anaheim Ducks. They survived a fierce battle that included four overtime games, winning the series 4\u20133 after a 3\u20132 Game 7 victory in Anaheim. The next round pitted the Red Wings against the top-seeded Chicago Blackhawks. Despite jumping out to a 3\u20131 series lead, the Red Wings would ultimately lose to the eventual Stanley Cup champions in seven games.\nOn July 5, 2013, the Red Wings signed long time Ottawa Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson to a one-year contract and long time Florida Panther Stephen Weiss to a five-year contract. In the 2013\u201314 season, the Red Wings moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference as part of the NHL's realignment. The move to the Eastern Conference allowed them to play a majority of their games against teams in the Eastern Time Zone. On April 9, 2014, the Red Wings clinched their 23rd consecutive playoff appearance. They would be eliminated in the first round by the Boston Bruins.\nOn April 9, 2015, the Red Wings clinched their 24th consecutive playoff appearance, thus extending their streak. The team was eliminated in the first round by the Tampa Bay Lightning. Petr Mrazek had earned the starting goaltender role from Jimmy Howard, and Kronwall was suspended for Game 7 as Tampa Bay erased a 3\u20132 deficit to win the series. Mike Babcock, concluding the final year of his contract, left the Red Wings to become the new head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Jeff Blashill, head coach of the Red Wings' top minor league affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, was named his successor on June 9.\nOn April 9, 2016, despite the Red Wings losing 3\u20132 to the New York Rangers, the Ottawa Senators defeated the Boston Bruins 6\u20131 as the Red Wings narrowly made the playoffs and extended their streak to a 25th season. They would lose in the first round to the Lightning in five games.\nOn February 10, 2017, club owner Mike Ilitch died. The loss of Pavel Datsyuk finally proved too much to handle, as the Red Wings' playoff appearance streak ended after 25 seasons in the 2016\u201317 season. The Red Wings won their last game at Joe Louis Arena 4\u20131 on April 9, 2017, against the New Jersey Devils.\nThe opening of Little Caesars Arena and rebuilding (2017\u2013present).\nThe Red Wings played their first regular season game at Little Caesars Arena on October 5, 2017, winning 4\u20132 over the Minnesota Wild. The Red Wings finished the 2017\u201318 season with a 30\u201339\u201313 record. They missed the playoffs for the second season in a row, marking the first time since the early 1980s the team missed the playoffs in consecutive years. The Red Wings finished the 2018\u201319 season with a 32\u201340\u201310 record, missing the playoffs for a third consecutive season.\nOn April 19, 2019, the Red Wings announced that Steve Yzerman would rejoin the team as general manager and executive vice president. On February 21, 2020, the Red Wings became the first team to be eliminated from playoff contention before the trade deadline since the Pittsburgh Penguins did so in the 2003\u201304 season. On March 10, 2020, the Red Wings clinched the worst overall record in NHL for the first time since the 1985\u201386 season. On March 12, 2020, the 2019\u201320 season was suspended by the NHL due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 26, 2020, the NHL announced that the rest of the season was over for the seven teams that did not qualify for the 24-team Stanley Cup Playoffs, which included the Red Wings. With a record of 17\u201349\u20135, this was the first time since the 1985\u201386 season that the Red Wings finished with fewer than 20 wins. The Red Wings also became the second team since the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, and the subsequent start of the salary cap era, to finish with a sub-.300 points percentage, along with the 2016\u201317 Colorado Avalanche. Their .275 points percentage was the worst for an NHL team since the 1999\u20132000 Atlanta Thrashers.\nDylan Larkin was named the 37th Red Wings captain on January 13, 2021.\nTeam information.\nLogo and uniforms.\nThe Red Wings' jerseys (traditionally known in hockey as \"sweaters\") have been more or less the same since the 1930s \u2013 a white or red base with red or white piping. The only significant changes have been the replacement of the word \"Detroit\" with the \"winged wheel\" logo in 1932, and vertical arch lettering for the players' names and block letters in 1983. The Red Wings only wear the vertical arched letters in the regular season and playoffs, while using straight serifed nameplates during the preseason.\n\"The Hockey News\" voted the Red Wings' \"winged wheel\" logo the second best in the league in 2008. The Red Wings, like all NHL teams, updated their jerseys to the new standard for the 2007\u201308 NHL season. The Red Wings kept their design as close to original as possible, the exceptions being: On the road (white) jersey, there was more red on the sleeves as the color panel began closer to the shoulder, and the letters of the captain and alternate captains were moved to the right shoulder.\nWhen Adidas became the uniform outfitter starting with the 2017\u201318 season, the Red Wings kept the same basic look.\nThe Red Wings have rarely used any alternate logos or uniforms since the trend became popular in the 1990s, the sole exceptions were select games of the 1991\u201392 season commemorating the league's 75th anniversary, and for a commemorative game on January 27, 1994 at Chicago Stadium. Those jerseys were based on the uniforms worn by the team (then the Detroit Cougars) in 1927\u201328. The throwbacks are primarily white with five red horizontal stripes on the body, the broadest middle stripe bearing \"Detroit\" in bold letters, and three red stripes on the sleeves. This jersey served as the basis for the uniforms worn by Wayne Gretzky's team of NHLPA All-Stars, nicknamed the \"99ers\", for their exhibition tour in Europe during the 1994\u201395 NHL lockout.\nThe Red Wings wore alternative \"retro\" jerseys for the 2009 NHL Winter Classic in Chicago. The jerseys were based on the uniforms worn by the Detroit Cougars during their inaugural season of 1926\u201327. These jerseys were white, with a single bold red stripe on the sleeves and chest, and a uniquely styled white Old English \"D\" centered on the chest stripe. These jerseys were also worn for their final 2009 regular season home game, again against the Chicago Blackhawks. The Red Wings again used an alternate jersey mimicking throwback jerseys for the 2014 NHL Winter Classic against the Toronto Maple Leafs at Michigan Stadium.\nThe Red Wings wore a specially designed one-time only jersey for their Stadium Series game in Denver against the Colorado Avalanche on February 27, 2016. The majority of this jersey was the traditional red, decorated with a thick diagonal white stripe running from the player's right shoulder across the front towards the left hip. The bottom of each sleeve featured a thick white stripe from wrist to elbow. The crest on the front of the jersey was a stylized red \"D\". The words \"Red Wings\" were printed in all capital letters on the left side of the collar, and the phrase \"EST. 1926\" was printed inside the back of the collar. These jerseys featured the current Red Wings logo on the left shoulder cap. The names and numbers were printed larger than traditional NHL jerseys to increase visibility and player identification for fans watching the game at Coors Field, a stadium traditionally used for Major League Baseball.\nThe Red Wings unveiled a uniform patch on September 27, 2016 to honor Gordie Howe, who died on June 10, 2016. The patch was a depiction of Howe's jersey number 9, and was worn by the team above the logo on the front of the jersey on the left side of the chest for all 82 regular season games during the 2016\u201317 season.\nThe Red Wings wore a specially designed one-time only jersey for the Centennial Classic in Toronto against the Toronto Maple Leafs on January 1, 2017. It was a white jersey that had four stripes on the arms. Three of the stripes were red, while the fourth was silver. On the silver stripes were the years the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup. The logo and numbers were outlined in silver.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Red Wings would wear special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate jerseys designed by Adidas. The uniform featured a white base and white sleeves, which were inspired by the Red Wings' road uniforms of the Original Six era. Silver stripes replaced red stripes in commemoration of the team's 11 Stanley Cup championships and the 2017 Centennial Classic.\nThe Red Wings' logo received significant media attention in August 2017 when it was discovered that a white supremacist group used a modified version of it, in which the wheel's spokes consisted of the occult SS symbol Black Sun; it was the aegis of their shields during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. As a result, the Red Wings condemned the group for the usage of the logo and threatened legal action.\nFan traditions.\nThe \"Legend of the Octopus\" is a sports tradition during Detroit Red Wings playoff games, in which an octopus is thrown onto the ice surface for good luck. During the playoffs, Joe Louis Arena was generally adorned with a giant octopus with red eyes, nicknamed \"Al\" after head ice manager Al Sobotka.\nThe 1952 playoffs featured the start of the octopus throw. The owner of a local fish market, Peter Cusimano, threw one from the stands onto the ice. The eight legs are symbolic of the eight wins it took to win the Stanley Cup at the time. The Red Wings went on to sweep both of their opponents that year en route to a Stanley Cup championship. The NHL has, at various times, tried to eliminate this tradition but it continues to this day.\nSobotka is the man responsible for removing the thrown creatures from the ice. When the Red Wings played at Joe Louis Arena, he was known for swinging the tossed octopuses above his head when walking off the ice. On April 19, 2008, the NHL sent a memo to the Red Wings that forbade this; they said that violating the mandate would result in a $10,000 fine. Instead, it was to up to the linesmen to remove the octopuses. In an email to the \"Detroit Free Press\", NHL spokesman Frank Brown justified the ban because matter flew off the octopus and got on the ice when Sobotka swung it above his head. This ban was later loosened to allow for the octopus twirling to take place at the Zamboni entrance.\nTypically during the last minute or two of games that the Red Wings are winning, especially around the end of the season and during the playoffs, fans are known to start singing along to Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'.\" The song is played over the PA system and continues until it is muted while the crowd sings the words \"Born and raised in South Detroit\", then the song resumes over the speakers in the arena.\nBroadcasters.\nThe Red Wings' flagship radio stations are Detroit sister stations WXYT-AM 1270 and WXYT-FM 97.1. Games are carried on both stations unless there is a conflict with Detroit Tigers baseball. There are several affiliate stations throughout Michigan and Southwestern Ontario.\nThe Red Wings' exclusive local television rights are held by Fox Sports Detroit.\nAnnouncers:\nHonored broadcasters.\nFour members of the Red Wings organization have received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award:\nLynch called the first locally televised game at Olympia for the original WWJ-TV in 1949. He remained with the organization for 63 years, serving as director of publicity from 1975 to 1982, and was the public address announcer from 1982 until his death in 2012. From 2008 to 2012, a second PA announcer was added to work alongside him, first John Fossen, then Erich Freiny. Freiny took over as the sole PA announcer following Lynch's death.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Detroit Red Wings.

Red Wings inductees include 65 former players and 12 builders of the sport. The 12 individuals recognized as builders by the Hall of Fame includes former Red Wings executives, general managers, head coaches, and owners. In addition to players and builders, several broadcasters were also awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Budd Lynch, a radio play-by-play announcer, was the first Red Wings broadcaster to be awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award. Lynch also served as Detroit's public address announcer from 1985 until his death in 2012. In addition to Lynch, Bruce Martyn, Mickey Redmond, and Dave Strader have also won the award.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Red Wings have retired eight numbers. The first number the Red Wings retired was No. 9 in 1972 in honor of Gordie Howe, who played right wing for the team from 1946 to 1971. Howe won both the Art Ross Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy six times each and won the Stanley Cup as a Red Wing four times. In 2007, the Red Wings retired Steve Yzerman's No. 19. During Yzerman's career, he won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, the Conn Smythe Trophy, the Frank J. Selke Trophy, the Lester Patrick Trophy, and the Ted Lindsay Award. Yzerman served as Detroit's captain for 19 seasons, an NHL record, and won the Stanley Cup three times as a player with the Red Wings. The most recent retired number is Red Kelly's No. 4, which was retired on February 1, 2019. During Kelly's 13-year career with the Red Wings, he won four Stanley Cups, the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy three times, and the James Norris Memorial Trophy once.\nThe Red Wings have also made the number 6 of Larry Aurie and the number 16 of Vladimir Konstantinov no longer available for issue. However, the numbers are not considered to be officially retired. Although Aurie's number was retired in 1938 by James E. Norris, current team owners do not consider the number to be retired. Konstantinov's number has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled in a vehicle accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. Number 99 is also unavailable as it was retired by the league in honor of Wayne Gretzky.\nTeam captains.\nAll the players who have served as team captain with the Detroit franchise.\nFranchise leaders.\nAll-time leading scorers.\nThese players rank in the top ten in franchise history in scoring as of the end of the 2018\u201319 season.

{"id": "8796", "revid": "5890910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8796", "title": "Demiurge", "text": "In the Platonic, Neopythagorean, Middle Platonic, and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy, the demiurge () is an artisan-like figure responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical universe. The Gnostics adopted the term \"demiurge\". Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the creator figure in the monotheistic sense, because the demiurge itself and the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are both considered consequences of something else. Depending on the system, they may be considered either uncreated and eternal or the product of some other entity.\nThe word \"demiurge\" is an English word derived from \"demiurgus\", a Latinised form of the Greek or \"d\u0113miurg\u00f3s\". It was originally a common noun meaning \"craftsman\" or \"artisan\", but gradually came to mean \"producer\", and eventually \"creator\". The philosophical usage and the proper noun derive from Plato's \"Timaeus\", written \u00a0360 BC, where the demiurge is presented as the creator of the universe. The demiurge is also described as a creator in the Platonic (\u00a0310\u201390 BC) and Middle Platonic (\u00a090 BC \u2013 AD 300) philosophical traditions. In the various branches of the Neoplatonic school (third century onwards), the demiurge is the fashioner of the real, perceptible world after the model of the Ideas, but (in most Neoplatonic systems) is still not itself \"the One\". In the arch-dualist ideology of the various Gnostic systems, the material universe is evil, while the non-material world is good. According to some strains of Gnosticism, the demiurge is malevolent, as it is linked to the material world. In others, including the teaching of Valentinus, the demiurge is simply ignorant or misguided.\nPlatonism and neoplatonism.\nPlato and the Timaeus.\nPlato, as the speaker Timaeus, refers to the Demiurge frequently in the Socratic dialogue \"Timaeus\" (28a ff.), \u00a0360 BC. The main character refers to the Demiurge as the entity who \"fashioned and shaped\" the material world. Timaeus describes the Demiurge as unreservedly benevolent, and so it desires a world as good as possible. Plato's work \"Timaeus\" is a philosophical reconciliation of Hesiod's cosmology in his \"Theogony\", syncretically reconciling Hesiod to Homer.\nMiddle Platonism.\nIn Numenius's Neo-Pythagorean and Middle Platonist cosmogony, the Demiurge is second God as the \"nous\" or thought of intelligibles and sensibles.\nNeoplatonism.\nPlotinus and the later Platonists worked to clarify the Demiurge. To Plotinus, the second emanation represents an uncreated second cause (see Pythagoras' Dyad). Plotinus sought to reconcile Aristotle's \"energeia\" with Plato's Demiurge, which, as Demiurge and mind (\"nous\"), is a critical component in the ontological construct of human consciousness used to explain and clarify substance theory within Platonic realism (also called idealism). In order to reconcile Aristotelian with Platonian philosophy, Plotinus metaphorically identified the demiurge (or \"nous\") within the pantheon of the Greek Gods as Zeus.\nHenology.\nThe first and highest aspect of God is described by Plato as the One (\u03a4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd, 'To Hen'), the source, or the Monad. This is the God above the Demiurge, and manifests through the actions of the Demiurge. The Monad emanated the demiurge or \"Nous\" (consciousness) from its \"indeterminate\" vitality due to the monad being so abundant that it overflowed back onto itself, causing self-reflection. This self-reflection of the indeterminate vitality was referred to by Plotinus as the \"Demiurge\" or creator. The second principle is organization in its reflection of the nonsentient force or \"dynamis\", also called the one or the Monad. The dyad is \"energeia\" emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called \"nous\", Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. Plotinus also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in \"The Enneads\" which more correctly is to express the concept of idealism or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the \"mind\" or \"nous\" (c.f. pantheism).\nPlotinus' form of Platonic idealism is to treat the Demiurge, \"nous\" as the contemplative faculty (\"ergon\") within man which orders the force (\"dynamis\") into conscious reality. In this, he claimed to reveal Plato's true meaning: a doctrine he learned from Platonic tradition that did not appear outside the academy or in Plato's text. This tradition of creator God as \"nous\" (the manifestation of consciousness), can be validated in the works of pre-Plotinus philosophers such as Numenius, as well as a connection between Hebrew and Platonic cosmology (see also Philo).\nThe Demiurge of Neoplatonism is the \"Nous\" (mind of God), and is one of the three ordering principles:\nBefore Numenius of Apamea and Plotinus' \"Enneads\", no Platonic works ontologically clarified the Demiurge from the allegory in Plato's \"Timaeus\". The idea of Demiurge was, however, addressed before Plotinus in the works of Christian writer Justin Martyr who built his understanding of the Demiurge on the works of Numenius.\nIamblichus.\nLater, the Neoplatonist Iamblichus changed the role of the \"One\", effectively altering the role of the Demiurge as second cause or dyad, which was one of the reasons that Iamblichus and his teacher Porphyry came into conflict.\nThe figure of the Demiurge emerges in the theoretic of Iamblichus, which conjoins the transcendent, incommunicable \u201cOne,\u201d or Source. Here, at the summit of this system, the Source and Demiurge (material realm) coexist via the process of \"henosis\".\nIamblichus describes the One as a monad whose first principle or emanation is intellect (\"nous\"), while among \"the many\" that follow it there is a second, super-existent \"One\" that is the producer of intellect or soul (\"psyche\").\nThe \"One\" is further separated into spheres of intelligence; the first and superior sphere is objects of thought, while the latter sphere is the domain of thought. Thus, a triad is formed of the intelligible \"nous\", the intellective \"nous\", and the \"psyche\" in order to reconcile further the various Hellenistic philosophical schools of Aristotle's \"actus\" and \"potentia\" (actuality and potentiality) of the unmoved mover and Plato's Demiurge.\nThen within this intellectual triad Iamblichus assigns the third rank to the Demiurge, identifying it with the perfect or Divine \"nous\" with the intellectual triad being promoted to a \"hebdomad\" (pure intellect).\nIn the theoretic of Plotinus, \"nous\" produces nature through intellectual mediation, thus the intellectualizing gods are followed by a triad of psychic gods.\nGnosticism.\nGnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God or Supreme Being and the demiurgic \"creator\" of the material. Several systems of Gnostic thought present the Demiurge as antagonistic to the will of the Supreme Being: his act of creation occurs in an unconscious semblance of the divine model, and thus is fundamentally flawed, or else is formed with the malevolent intention of entrapping aspects of the divine \"in\" materiality. Thus, in such systems, the Demiurge acts as a solution to (or, at least possibly, the problem or cause that gives rise to) the problem of evil.\nMythos.\nOne Gnostic mythos describes the declination of aspects of the divine into human form. Sophia (Greek: \u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, lit. 'wisdom'), the Demiurge's mother and partial aspect of the divine \"Pleroma\" or \"Fullness,\" desired to create something apart from the divine totality, without the receipt of divine assent. In this act of separate creation, she gave birth to the monstrous Demiurge and, being ashamed of her deed, wrapped him in a cloud and created a throne for him within it. The Demiurge, isolated, did not behold his mother, nor anyone else, and concluded that only he existed, ignorant of the superior levels of reality.\nThe Demiurge, having received a portion of power from his mother, sets about a work of creation in unconscious imitation of the superior Pleromatic realm: He frames the seven heavens, as well as all material and animal things, according to forms furnished by his mother; working, however, blindly and ignorant even of the existence of the mother who is the source of all his energy. He is blind to all that is spiritual, but he is king over the other two provinces. The word \"d\u0113miurgos\" properly describes his relation to the material; he is the \"father\" of that which is animal like himself.\nThus Sophia's power becomes enclosed within the material forms of humanity, themselves entrapped within the material universe: the goal of Gnostic movements was typically the awakening of this spark, which permitted a return by the subject to the superior, non-material realities which were its primal source.\nAngels.\nPsalm 82 begins (), \"God stands in the assembly of El , in the midst of the gods he renders judgment\", indicating a plurality of gods, although it does not indicate that these gods were co-actors in creation. Philo had inferred from the expression \"Let us make man\" of the Book of Genesis that God had used other beings as assistants in the creation of man, and he explains in this way why man is capable of vice as well as virtue, ascribing the origin of the latter to God, of the former to his helpers in the work of creation.\nThe earliest Gnostic sects ascribe the work of creation to angels, some of them using the same passage in Genesis. So Irenaeus tells of the system of Simon Magus, of the system of Menander, of the system of Saturninus, in which the number of these angels is reckoned as seven, and of the system of Carpocrates. In the report of the system of Basilides, we are told that our world was made by the angels who occupy the lowest heaven; but special mention is made of their chief, who is said to have been the God of the Jews, to have led that people out of the land of Egypt, and to have given them their law. The prophecies are ascribed not to the chief but to the other world-making angels.\nThe Latin translation, confirmed by Hippolytus of Rome, makes Irenaeus state that according to Cerinthus (who shows Ebionite influence), creation was made by a power quite separate from the Supreme God and ignorant of him. Theodoret, who here copies Irenaeus, turns this into the plural number \"powers\", and so Epiphanius of Salamis represents Cerinthus as agreeing with Carpocrates in the doctrine that the world was made by angels.\nYaldabaoth.\nIn the Ophite and Sethian systems, which have many affinities with the teachings of Valentinus, the making of the world is ascribed to a company of seven archons, whose names are given, but still more prominent is their chief, \"Yaldabaoth\" (also known as \"Yaltabaoth\" or \"Ialdabaoth\").\nIn the \"Apocryphon of John\" \u00a0AD 120\u2013180, the demiurge arrogantly declares that he has made the world by himself:\nNow the archon [\"ruler\"] who is weak has three names. The first name is Yaltabaoth, the second is Saklas [\"fool\"], and the third is Samael. And he is impious in his arrogance which is in him. For he said, 'I am God and there is no other God beside me,' for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which he had come.\nHe is Demiurge and maker of man, but as a ray of light from above enters the body of man and gives him a soul, Yaldabaoth is filled with envy; he tries to limit man's knowledge by forbidding him the fruit of knowledge in paradise. At the consummation of all things, all light will return to the Pleroma. But Yaldabaoth, the Demiurge, with the material world, will be cast into the lower depths.\nYaldabaoth is frequently called \"the Lion-faced\", \"leontoeides\", and is said to have the body of a serpent. The demiurge is also described as having a fiery nature, applying the words of Moses to him: \"the Lord our God is a burning and consuming fire\". Hippolytus claims that Simon used a similar description.\nIn \"Pistis Sophia\", Yaldabaoth has already sunk from his high estate and resides in Chaos, where, with his forty-nine demons, he tortures wicked souls in boiling rivers of pitch, and with other punishments (pp.\u00a0257, 382). He is an archon with the face of a lion, half flame, and half darkness.\nUnder the name of \"Nebro\" (rebel), Yaldabaoth is called an angel in the apocryphal \"Gospel of Judas\". He is first mentioned in \"The Cosmos, Chaos, and the Underworld\" as one of the twelve angels to come \"into being [to] rule over chaos and the [underworld]\". He comes from heaven, and it is said his \"face flashed with fire and [his] appearance was defiled with blood\". Nebro creates six angels in addition to the angel Saklas to be his assistants. These six, in turn, create another twelve angels \"with each one receiving a portion in the heavens\".\nNames.\nThe most probable derivation of the name \"Yaldabaoth\" was that given by Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler. Gieseler believed the name was derived from the Aramaic \"yald\u0101 bahuth\", , meaning \"Son of Chaos\". However, Gilles Quispel notes:\n\"Samael\" literally means \"Blind God\" or \"God of the Blind\" in Hebrew (). This being is considered not only blind, or ignorant of its own origins, but may, in addition, be evil; its name is also found in Judaism as the Angel of Death and in Christian demonology. This link to Judeo-Christian tradition leads to a further comparison with Satan. Another alternative title for the demiurge is \"Saklas\", Aramaic for \"fool\".\nThe angelic name \"Ariel\" (Hebrew: 'the lion of God') has also been used to refer to the Demiurge and is called his \"perfect\" name; in some Gnostic lore, Ariel has been called an ancient or original name for Ialdabaoth. The name has also been inscribed on amulets as \"Ariel Ialdabaoth\", and the figure of the archon inscribed with \"Aariel\".\nMarcion.\nAccording to Marcion, the title God was given to the Demiurge, who was to be sharply distinguished from the higher Good God. The former was \"d\u00edkaios,\" severely just, the latter \"agath\u00f3s,\" or loving-kind; the former was the \"god of this world\" (), the God of the Old Testament, the latter the true God of the New Testament. Christ, in reality, is the Son of the Good God. The true believer in Christ entered into God's kingdom, the unbeliever remained forever the slave of the Demiurge.\nValentinus.\nIt is in the system of Valentinus that the name \"D\u0113miurgos\" is used, which occurs nowhere in Irenaeus except in connection with the Valentinian system; we may reasonably conclude that it was Valentinus who adopted from Platonism the use of this word. When it is employed by other Gnostics either it is not used in a technical sense, or its use has been borrowed from Valentinus. But it is only the name that can be said to be specially Valentinian; the personage intended by it corresponds more or less closely with the Yaldabaoth of the Ophites, the great Archon of Basilides, the Elohim of Justinus, etc.\nThe Valentinian theory elaborates that from Achamoth (\"he k\u00e1t\u014d soph\u00eda\" or lower wisdom) three kinds of substance take their origin, the spiritual (\"pneumatiko\u00ed\"), the animal (\"psychiko\u00ed\") and the material (\"hyliko\u00ed\"). The Demiurge belongs to the second kind, as he was the offspring of a union of Achamoth with matter. And as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of \"Soph\u00eda\" the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Propat\u00f4r, or Supreme God.\nIn creating this world out of Chaos the Demiurge was unconsciously influenced for good; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united with Jesus the Saviour, Who redeemed men. These are either \"hyliko\u00ed\" or \"pneumatiko\u00ed\".\nThe first, or material men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or animal men, together with the Demiurge, will enter a middle state, neither Pleroma nor \"hyle\"; the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the Pleroma divested of body (\"hyle\") and soul (\"psych\u00e9\"). In this most common form of Gnosticism the Demiurge had an inferior though not intrinsically evil function in the universe as the head of the animal, or psychic world.\nThe devil.\nOpinions on the devil, and his relationship to the Demiurge, varied. The Ophites held that he and his demons constantly oppose and thwart the human race, as it was on their account the devil was cast down into this world. According to one variant of the Valentinian system, the Demiurge is also the maker, out of the appropriate substance, of an order of \"spiritual\" beings, the devil, the prince of this world, and his angels. But the devil, as being a \"spirit\" of wickedness, is able to recognise the higher spiritual world, of which his maker the Demiurge, who is only animal, has no real knowledge. The devil resides in this lower world, of which he is the prince, the Demiurge in the heavens; his mother Sophia in the middle region, above the heavens and below the Pleroma.\nThe Valentinian Heracleon interpreted the devil as the \"principle\" of evil, that of \"hyle\" (matter). As he writes in his commentary on ,\nThe mountain represents the Devil, or his world, since the Devil was one part of the whole of matter, but the world is the total mountain of evil, a deserted dwelling place of beasts, to which all who lived before the law and all Gentiles render worship. But Jerusalem represents the creation or the Creator whom the Jews worship. ... You then who are spiritual should worship neither the creation nor the Craftsman, but the Father of Truth. \nThis vilification of the creator was held to be inimical to Christianity by the early fathers of the church. In refuting the beliefs of the gnostics, Irenaeus stated that \"Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and himself executing judgment.\"\nCathars.\nCatharism apparently inherited their idea of Satan as the creator of the evil world from Gnosticism. Quispel writes,\nNeoplatonism and Gnosticism.\nGnosticism attributed falsehood or evil to the concept of the Demiurge or creator, though in some Gnostic traditions the creator is from a fallen, ignorant, or lesser\u2014rather than evil\u2014perspective, such as that of Valentinius.\nPlotinus.\nThe Neoplatonic philosopher Plotinus addressed within his works Gnosticism's conception of the Demiurge, which he saw as un-Hellenic and blasphemous to the Demiurge or creator of Plato. Plotinus, along with his teacher Ammonius Saccas, was the founder of Neoplatonism. In the ninth tractate of the second of his \"Enneads\", Plotinus criticizes his opponents for their appropriation of ideas from Plato:\nOf note here is the remark concerning the second hypostasis or Creator and third hypostasis or World Soul. Plotinus criticizes his opponents for \"all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own\" which, he declares, \"have been picked up outside of the truth\"; they attempt to conceal rather than admit their indebtedness to ancient philosophy, which they have corrupted by their extraneous and misguided embellishments. Thus their understanding of the Demiurge is similarly flawed in comparison to Plato\u2019s original intentions.\nWhereas Plato's Demiurge is good wishing good on his creation, Gnosticism contends that the Demiurge is not only the originator of evil but is evil as well. Hence the title of Plotinus' refutation: \"Against Those That Affirm the Creator of the Kosmos and the Kosmos Itself to be Evil\" (generally quoted as \"Against the Gnostics\"). Plotinus argues of the disconnect or great barrier that is created between the \"nous\" or mind's noumenon (see Heraclitus) and the material world (phenomenon) by believing the material world is evil.\nThe majority of scholars tend to understand Plotinus' opponents as being a Gnostic sect\u2014certainly (specifically Sethian), several such groups were present in Alexandria and elsewhere about the Mediterranean during Plotinus' lifetime. Plotinus specifically points to the Gnostic doctrine of Sophia and her emission of the Demiurge.\nThough the former understanding certainly enjoys the greatest popularity, the identification of Plotinus' opponents as Gnostic is not without some contention. Christos Evangeliou has contended that Plotinus' opponents might be better described as simply \"Christian Gnostics\", arguing that several of Plotinus' criticisms are as applicable to orthodox Christian doctrine as well. Also, considering the evidence from the time, Evangeliou thought the definition of the term \"Gnostics\" was unclear. Of note here is that while Plotinus' student Porphyry names Christianity specifically in Porphyry's own works, and Plotinus is to have been a known associate of the Christian Origen, none of Plotinus' works mention Christ or Christianity\u2014whereas Plotinus specifically addresses his target in the \"Enneads\" as the Gnostics.\nA. H. Armstrong identified the so-called \"Gnostics\" that Plotinus was attacking as Jewish and Pagan, in his introduction to the tract in his translation of the \"Enneads\". Armstrong alluding to Gnosticism being a Hellenic philosophical heresy of sorts, which later engaged Christianity and Neoplatonism.\nJohn D. Turner, professor of religious studies at the University of Nebraska, and famed translator and editor of the Nag Hammadi library, stated that the text Plotinus and his students read was Sethian Gnosticism, which predates Christianity. It appears that Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as dystheism or misotheism for the creator God as an answer to the problem of evil) as the targets of his criticism.\nEmil Cioran also wrote his \"Le mauvais d\u00e9miurge\" (\"The Evil Demiurge\"), published in 1969, influenced by Gnosticism and Schopenhauerian interpretation of Platonic ontology, as well as that of Plotinus."}
{"id": "8798", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8798", "title": "Doubravka of Bohemia", "text": "Doubravka of Bohemia, Dobrawa (, ; ca. 940/45 \u2013 977) was a Bohemian princess of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty and by marriage Duchess of the Polans.\nShe was the daughter of Boleslaus I the Cruel, Duke of Bohemia, whose wife may have been the mysterious Biagota.\nAccording to earlier sources, Doubravka urged her husband Mieszko I of Poland to accept baptism in 966, the year after their marriage. Modern historians believe, however, that the change of religion by Mieszko was one of the points discussed in the Polish-Bohemian agreement concluded soon before his marriage with Doubravka. Her role in his conversion is not considered now to be as important as it is often represented in medieval chronicles.\nEarly life.\nDoubravka's date of birth is not known. The only indication is communicated by the chronicler Cosmas of Prague, who stated that the Bohemian princess at the time of her marriage with Mieszko I was \"an old woman\". The passage is regarded as tendentious and of little reliability, and some researchers believe that the statement was made with malicious intent. It is possible that in the statement about Doubravka's age, Cosmas was making a reference to the age difference between her and her sister Mlada. That would give him a basis for determining Doubravka as \"old.\" (The word \"Mlada\" means \"Young\"). It also found that Cosmas confuses Doubravka with Mieszko I's second wife Oda, who at the time of her marriage was around 19\u201325 years old, a relatively advanced age for a bride according to the customs of the Middle Ages. Some researchers have taken up speculative views, such as Jerzy Strzelczyk, who assumed that \"in the light of contemporary concepts and habits of marriage of that time (when as a rule marriages were contracted with teenage girls) is assumed that Doubravka had passed her early youth, so, it's probable that she was in her late teens or twenties\".\nNothing is known about Doubravka's childhood and youth. In 1895 Oswald Balzer refuted reports that previous to her marriage with Mieszko I, Doubravka was married to Gunther, Margrave of Merseburg and they had a son, Gunzelin. This view is based on the fact that Thietmar of Merseburg in his chronicles named Gunzelin, Gunther's son, \"brother\" of Boles\u0142aw I the Brave, Doubravka's son. Currently, historians believed that Gunzelin and Boles\u0142aw I are in fact cousins or brothers-in-law.\nMarriage and Christianization of Poland.\nIn the second half of 964 an alliance between Boleslav I the Cruel, Duke of Bohemia, and Mieszko I of Poland was concluded. In order to consolidate the agreement, in 965 Boleslav I's daughter Doubravka was married to Mieszko I. The marriage cemented the Polish-Bohemian alliance, which continued even after Doubravka's death.\nTwo independent sources attribute to Doubravka an important role in the conversion to Christianity of Mieszko I and Poland. The first is the chronicles of Thietmar, who was born two years before the death of Doubravka. He wrote that the Bohemian princess tried to persuade her husband to accept Christianity (even at the cost of breaking their marriage and with it the Polish-Bohemian alliance). In the end, she finally obtained the conversion of Mieszko I and with him, of all Poland. In turn, the 12th-century chronicler Gallus Anonymus says that Doubravka came to Poland surrounded by secular and religious dignitaries. She agreed to marry Mieszko I providing that he was baptized. The Polish ruler accepted, and only then was able to marry the Bohemian princess.\nModern historians agree that the baptism of Mieszko I was dictated by political benefits and should not be attributed to any action of Doubravka. She is held to have had virtually no role in the conversion of her husband. Historians note that the narrative of the conversion of Mieszko I thanks to Doubravka formed part of the tradition of the Church which stressed the conversion of Pagan rulers through the influence of women.\nDoubravka did have a significant role in the Christianization of the Poles. In her wedding procession, she arrived in Poland with Christian clergymen, among them possibly Jordan, ordained the first bishop of Poland in 968. Tradition attributes to Doubravka the establishment of the Holy Trinity and St. Wit Churches in Gniezno and the Church of the Virgin Mary in Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144.\nChildren.\nDoubravka and Mieszko I had at least one son, Boles\u0142aw the Brave (b. 967 - d. 17 June 1025). A daughter, called \u015awi\u0119tos\u0142awa or Sigrid the Haughty, married first King Eric the Victorious of Sweden and later King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark, by whom she was the mother of Canute the Great. Gunhilda of Poland, who married Swyen Forkbeard, is usually identified as this daughter. There is a hypothesis asserting the existence of another daughter of Mieszko I who was married to a Pomeranian Slavic prince. She could have been the daughter of either Doubravka or one of Mieszko's previous pagan wives. Also, a theory has been advanced (apparently recorded by Thietmar of Prague and supported by Oswald Balzer in 1895) that Vladivoj (c. 981 \u2013 January 1003), who ruled as duke of Bohemia from 1002 until 1003, was another son of Doubravka and Mieszko I. Although modern historians have rejected this hypothesis, Czech historiography has supported the notion of mixed Piast-P\u0159emyslid parentage for Vladivoj.\nDeath and burial.\nDoubravka died in 977. In his study of 1888, J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski wrote that \"her tomb was discovered in Gniezno Cathedral. It was a simple stone marked with a cross. Purple robes and a weighty gold loincloth were the only objects found in her tomb.\" A similar view of Doubravka's burial place was expressed earlier, in 1843, by Edward Raczy\u0144ski in his study \"Wspomnienia Wielkopolski to jest wojew\u00f3dztw pozna\u0144skiego, kaliskiego i gnie\u017anie\u0144skiego\" (Memories of the Greater Poland districts of Pozna\u0144, Kalisz and Gniezno). However, the burial place of the Bohemian princess is now considered to be unknown.\nDoubravka's death weakened the Polish-Bohemian alliance, which finally collapsed in the mid-980s."}
{"id": "8799", "revid": "41304243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8799", "title": "D. B. Cooper", "text": "Dan Cooper is the pseudonym of an unidentified man who hijacked a Boeing 727 aircraft in United States airspace between Portland and Seattle on the afternoon of November 24, 1971. The man purchased his airline ticket using the alias Dan Cooper but, because of a news miscommunication, became known in popular lore as D. B. Cooper. He extorted $200,000 in ransom () and parachuted to an uncertain fate. Despite an extensive manhunt and protracted FBI investigation, the perpetrator has never been located or identified. It remains the only unsolved case of air piracy in commercial aviation history.\nAvailable evidence and a preponderance of expert opinion suggest that Cooper probably did not survive his high-risk jump, but his remains have never been recovered. The FBI maintained an active investigation for 49 years after the hijacking. Despite a case file that has grown to over 60 volumes over that period, no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding Cooper's true identity or whereabouts. \nNumerous theories of widely varying plausibility have been proposed over the years by investigators, reporters, and amateur enthusiasts. A young boy discovered a small cache of banknotes from the ransom along the banks of the Columbia River in February 1980. The find triggered renewed interest but ultimately only deepened the mystery, and the great majority of the ransom remains unrecovered.\nThe FBI officially suspended active investigation of the case in July 2016, but the agency continues to request that any physical evidence that might emerge related to the parachutes or the ransom money be submitted for analysis.\nHijacking.\nOn Thanksgiving eve, November 24, 1971, a middle-aged man carrying a black attach\u00e9 case approached the flight counter of Northwest Orient Airlines at Portland International Airport. He identified himself as \"Dan Cooper\" and used cash to purchase a one-way ticket on Flight\u00a0305, a 30-minute trip north to Seattle. Cooper boarded the aircraft, a Boeing 727-100 (FAA registration N467US), and took seat 18C (18E by one account, 15D by another) in the rear of the passenger cabin. Cooper appeared to be in his mid-40s and was wearing a business suit with a black tie and white shirt. He quietly ordered a drink\u2014 bourbon and 7 Up\u2014 while the flight was waiting to take off.\nFlight 305, approximately one-third full, departed Portland on schedule at 2:50\u00a0p.m. PST. Shortly after takeoff, Cooper handed a note to Florence Schaffner, the flight attendant situated nearest to him in a jump seat attached to the aft stair door. Schaffner, assuming the note contained a lonely businessman's phone number, dropped it unopened into her purse. Cooper leaned toward her and whispered, \"Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb.\"\nThe note was printed in neat, all-capital letters with a felt-tip pen. Its exact wording is unknown, because Cooper later reclaimed it, but Schaffner recalled that the note said that Cooper had a bomb in his briefcase. After Schaffner read the note, Cooper told her to sit beside him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper opened his briefcase long enough for her to glimpse eight red cylinders (\"four on top of four\") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he stated his demands: $200,000 in \"negotiable American currency\"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. As Schaffner took it in and tried to control her emotions, to her surprise, the man gently calmed her down. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit; when she returned, Cooper was wearing dark sunglasses.\nThe pilot, William A. Scott (1920\u20132001) contacted Seattle\u2013Tacoma Airport air traffic control, which informed local and federal authorities. The 35 other passengers were given false information that their arrival in Seattle would be delayed because of a \"minor mechanical difficulty\". Northwest Orient's president, Donald Nyrop, authorized payment of the ransom, and ordered all employees to cooperate fully with the hijacker's demands. The aircraft circled Puget Sound for approximately two hours to allow Seattle police and the FBI sufficient time to assemble Cooper's parachutes and ransom money, and to mobilize emergency personnel.\nFlight attendant Tina Mucklow recalled that Cooper appeared familiar with the local terrain; at one point he remarked, \"Looks like Tacoma down there,\" as the aircraft flew above it. He also correctly mentioned that McChord Air Force Base was only a 20-minute drive (at that time) from Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Schaffner described him as calm, polite, and well-spoken, not at all consistent with the stereotypes (enraged, hardened criminals or \"take-me-to-Cuba\" political dissidents) popularly associated with air piracy at the time. \"He wasn't nervous,\" Mucklow told investigators. \"He seemed rather nice. He was never cruel or nasty. He was thoughtful and calm all the time.\" He ordered a second bourbon and soda, paid his drink tab (and attempted to give Mucklow the change), and offered to request meals for the flight crew during the stop in Seattle.\nFBI agents assembled the ransom money from several Seattle-area banks\u00a0\u2013 10,000 unmarked 20-dollar bills, most with serial numbers beginning with the letter \"L\" indicating issuance by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and most from the 1963A or 1969 series\u00a0\u2013 and made a microfilm photograph of each of them. Cooper rejected the military-issue parachutes offered by McChord AFB personnel, instead demanding civilian parachutes with manually operated ripcords. Seattle police obtained them from a local skydiving school.\nPassengers released.\nAt 5:24\u00a0p.m. PST, Cooper was informed that his demands had been met, and at 5:39\u00a0p.m. the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. It was more than an hour after sunset and Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the apron and close each window shade in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer. He delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper ordered all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.\nDuring refueling, Cooper outlined his flight plan to the cockpit crew: a southeast course toward Mexico City at the minimum airspeed possible without stalling the aircraft\u2014approximately \u2014at a maximum altitude. He further specified that the landing gear remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the wing flaps be lowered 15\u00a0degrees, and the cabin remain unpressurized. Copilot William J. Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately under the specified flight configuration, which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering Mexico. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on Reno, Nevada, as the refueling Cooper further directed that the aircraft take off with the rear exit door open and its staircase extended. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, but he would not argue the point; he would lower it once they were airborne.\nAn FAA official requested a face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied. The refueling process was delayed because of a vapor lock in the fuel tanker truck's pumping mechanism. However, once refueling had been completed, the plane was able to take off.\nBack in the air.\nAt approximately 7:40\u00a0p.m., the Boeing 727 took off with only Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer Harold E. Anderson on board. Two F-106 fighter aircraft were scrambled from McChord Air Force Base and followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view. A Lockheed T-33 trainer, diverted from an unrelated Air National Guard mission, also shadowed the 727 before running low on fuel and turning back near the Oregon\u2013California state line.\nAfter takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to join the rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow observed Cooper tying something, possibly the money bag, around his waist. At approximately 8:00\u00a0p.m., a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. Rataczak offered assistance via the aircraft's intercom system, \u201cEverything OK back there? Anything we can do for you?\u201d Cooper, calm and cool and apparently confident, refused, saying \u201cNo!\u201d. This was the last communication they had with him. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.\nAt approximately 8:13\u00a0p.m., the aircraft's tail section sustained a sudden upward movement, large enough to require trimming to bring the plane back to level flight. At approximately 10:15\u00a0p.m., the aircraft's aft airstair was still deployed when Scott and Rataczak landed the 727 at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it had not yet been determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard, but an armed search quickly confirmed his absence.\nInvestigation.\nFBI agents recovered 66 unidentified latent fingerprints aboard the airliner. The agents also found Cooper's black clip-on tie, his tie clip and two of the four parachutes, one of which had been opened and from whose canopy two shroud (suspension) lines had been cut. Authorities interviewed eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle and Reno, and all those who personally interacted with Cooper. A series of composite sketches was developed.\nLocal police and FBI agents immediately began questioning possible suspects. One of the first was an Oregon man with a minor police record named D. B. Cooper, contacted by Portland police on the off chance that the hijacker had used his real name or the same alias in a previous crime. He was quickly ruled out as a suspect; but a local reporter named James Long, rushing to meet an imminent deadline, confused the eliminated suspect's name with the pseudonym used by the hijacker. A wire service reporter (Clyde Jabin of UPI by most accounts, Joe Frazier of the AP by others) republished the error, followed by numerous other media sources; the name \"D. B. Cooper\" became lodged in the public's collective memory.\nA precise search area was difficult to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was the length of time he remained in free fall before pulling his ripcord\u2014if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne black-clad human figure could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727.\nIn an experimental re-creation, Scott piloted the aircraft used in the hijacking in the same flight configuration. FBI agents, pushing a sled out of the open airstair, were able to reproduce the upward motion of the tail section described by the flight crew at 8:13\u00a0p.m; it was concluded that 8:13\u00a0p.m. was the most likely jump time. At that moment the aircraft was flying through a heavy rainstorm over the Lewis River in southwestern Washington.\nInitial extrapolations placed Cooper's landing zone within an area on the southernmost outreach of Mount St. Helens, a few miles southeast of Ariel, Washington, near Lake Merwin, an artificial lake formed by a dam on the Lewis River. Search efforts focused on Clark and Cowlitz counties, encompassing the terrain immediately south and north, respectively, of the Lewis River in southwest Washington. FBI agents and sheriff's deputies from those counties searched large areas of the mountainous wilderness on foot and by helicopter. Door-to-door searches of local farmhouses were also carried out. Other search parties ran patrol boats along Lake Merwin and Yale Lake, the reservoir immediately to its east. No trace of Cooper, nor any of the equipment presumed to have left the aircraft with him, was found.\nThe FBI also coordinated an aerial search, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the Oregon Army National Guard, along the entire flight path (known as Victor 23 in standard aviation terminology but \"Vector 23\" in most Cooper from Seattle to Reno. Although numerous broken treetops and several pieces of plastic and other objects resembling parachute canopies were sighted and investigated, nothing relevant to the hijacking was found.\nShortly after the spring thaw in early 1972, teams of FBI agents aided by some 200 Army soldiers from Fort Lewis, along with Air Force personnel, National Guardsmen, and civilian volunteers, conducted another thorough ground search of Clark and Cowlitz counties for eighteen days in March, and then an additional eighteen days in April. Electronic Explorations Company, a marine salvage firm, used a submarine to search the depths of Lake Merwin. Two local women stumbled upon a skeleton in an abandoned structure in Clark County; it was later identified as the remains of Barbara Ann Derry, a teenaged girl who had been abducted and murdered several weeks before. Ultimately, the search and recovery operation\u2014arguably the most extensive, and intensive, in U.S. history\u2014uncovered no significant material evidence related to the hijacking.\nSearch for ransom money.\nA month after the hijacking, the FBI distributed lists of the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, racetracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted large cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, to a maximum of $25,000. In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General John N. Mitchell released the serial numbers to the general public. In 1972, two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to swindle $30,000 from a \"Newsweek\" reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a man they falsely claimed was the hijacker.\nIn early 1973, with the ransom money still missing, \"The Oregon Journal\" republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 to the first person to turn in a ransom bill to the newspaper or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the \"Post-Intelligencer\" made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.\nLater developments.\nSubsequent analyses indicated that the original landing zone estimate was inaccurate: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was farther east than initially assumed. Additional data from a variety of sources\u2014in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305\u2014indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.\nInvestigation suspended.\nOn July 8, 2016, the FBI announced that it was suspending active investigation of the Cooper case, citing a need to focus its investigative resources and manpower on issues of higher and more urgent priority. Local field offices will continue to accept any legitimate physical evidence, related specifically to the parachutes or to the ransom money, that may emerge in the future. The 60-volume case file compiled over the 45-year course of the investigation will be preserved for historical purposes at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. on the FBI website; there was a 28-part packet of evidence gathered over the years. All the evidence is open to the public.\nPhysical evidence.\nThe official physical description of Cooper has remained unchanged and is considered reliable. Flight attendants Schaffner and Mucklow, who spent the most time with Cooper, were interviewed on the same night in separate cities, and gave nearly identical descriptions: around tall, , mid-40s, with close-set piercing brown eyes and swarthy skin.\nThree major pieces of evidence were left on the plane when D.B. Cooper jumped: his black clip-on tie, a mother-of-pearl tie clip, and eight filter-tipped Raleigh cigarette butts. The information about the tie and tie clip was not announced to the public for almost 20 years, when in 1991 it was revealed in the book \"D.B. Cooper: The Real McCoy\". At some time after the hijacking, the cigarette butts were lost.\nIn November 1978, a placard printed with instructions for lowering the aft stairs of a 727 was found by a deer hunter near a logging road about east of Castle Rock, Washington, well north of Lake Merwin, but within Flight 305's basic flight path.\nOn February 10, 1980, eight-year-old Brian Ingram was vacationing with his family on the Columbia River at a beachfront known as Tina (or Tena) Bar, about downstream from Vancouver, Washington, and southwest of Ariel. He uncovered three packets of the ransom cash as he raked the sandy riverbank to build a campfire. The bills were disintegrated, but still bundled in rubber bands. FBI technicians confirmed that the money was indeed a portion of the ransom: two packets of 100 twenty-dollar bills each, and a third packet of 90, all arranged in the same order as when given to Cooper. \nIn 1986, after protracted negotiations, the recovered bills were divided equally between Ingram and Northwest Orient's insurer; the FBI retained fourteen examples as evidence. Ingram sold fifteen of his bills at auction in 2008 for about $37,000. \nTo date, none of the 9,710 remaining bills has turned up anywhere. Their serial numbers remain available online for public search. The Columbia River ransom money and the airstair instruction placard remain the only confirmed physical evidence from the hijacking ever found outside the aircraft.\nIn 2017, a group of volunteer investigators uncovered what they believe to be \"potential evidence, what appears to be a decades-old parachute strap\" in the Pacific Northwest. This was followed later in August 2017 with a piece of foam, suspected of being part of Cooper's backpack.\nSubsequent FBI disclosures.\nIn late 2007, the FBI announced that a partial DNA profile had been obtained from three organic samples found on Cooper's clip-on tie in 2001, though they later acknowledged that there is no evidence that the hijacker was the source of the sample material. \"The tie had two small DNA samples, and one large sample,\" said Special Agent Fred Gutt. \"It's difficult to draw firm conclusions from these samples.\" The Bureau also made public a file of previously unreleased evidence, including Cooper's 1971 plane ticket (price: $20.00, paid in cash), and posted previously unreleased composite sketches and fact sheets, along with a request to the general public for information which might lead to Cooper's positive identification.\nThey also disclosed that Cooper had chosen the older of the two primary parachutes supplied to him, rather than the technically superior professional sport parachute, and that from the two reserve parachutes, he selected a \"dummy\", an unusable unit with an inoperative ripcord intended for classroom demonstrations, although it had clear markings identifying it to any experienced skydiver as non-functional. (He cannibalized the other, functional reserve parachute, possibly using its shrouds to tie the money bag shut, and to secure the bag to his body as witnessed by Mucklow.) The FBI stressed that inclusion of the dummy reserve parachute, one of four obtained in haste from a Seattle skydiving school, was accidental.\nIn March 2009, the FBI disclosed that Tom Kaye, a paleontologist from the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle, had assembled a team of \"citizen sleuths\", including scientific illustrator Carol Abraczinskas and metallurgist Alan Stone. The group, eventually known as the Cooper Research Team, reinvestigated important components of the case using GPS, satellite imagery, and other technologies unavailable in 1971. Although they gained little new information about the buried ransom money or Cooper's landing zone, they were able to find and analyze hundreds of minute particles on Cooper's tie using electron microscopy. \"Lycopodium\" spores (likely from a pharmaceutical product) were identified, as well as fragments of bismuth and aluminum.\nIn November 2011, Kaye announced that particles of pure (unalloyed) titanium had also been found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than in the 2010s, was at that time found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. The findings suggested that Cooper might have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore ties in such facilities at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or at a company that recovered scrap metal from those types of factories.\nIn January 2017, Kaye reported that rare earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's supersonic transport development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured cathode ray tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.\nTheories and conjecture.\nOver the 45-year span of its active investigation, the FBI periodically made public some of its working hypotheses and tentative conclusions, drawn from witness testimony and the scarce physical evidence.\nSuspect profiling.\nCooper appeared to be familiar with the Seattle area and may have been an Air Force veteran, based on testimony that he recognized the city of Tacoma from the air as the jet circled Puget Sound, and his accurate comment to Mucklow that McChord AFB was approximately 20\u00a0minutes' driving time from the Seattle-Tacoma Airport\u2014a detail most civilians would not know, or comment upon. His financial situation was very likely desperate. According to the FBI's retired chief investigator, Ralph Himmelsbach, extortionists and other criminals who steal large amounts of money nearly always do so because they need it urgently; otherwise, the crime is not worth the considerable risk. Alternatively, Cooper may have been \"a thrill seeker\" who made the jump \"just to prove it could be done.\"\nAgents theorized that Cooper took his alias from a popular Belgian comic book series of the 1970s featuring the fictional hero Dan Cooper, a Royal Canadian Air Force test pilot who took part in numerous heroic adventures, including parachuting. (One cover from the series, reproduced on the FBI website, depicts test pilot Cooper skydiving in full paratrooper regalia.) Because the Dan Cooper comics were never translated into English, nor imported to the U.S., they speculated that he had encountered them during a tour of duty in Europe. The Cooper Research Team suggested the alternative possibility that Cooper was Canadian, and found the comics in Canada, where they were also sold. They noted his specific demand for \"negotiable American currency\", a phrase seldom if ever used by American citizens; since witnesses stated that Cooper had no distinguishable accent, Canada would be his most likely country of origin if he were not a U.S. citizen.\nEvidence suggested that Cooper was knowledgeable about flying technique, aircraft, and the terrain. He demanded four parachutes to force the assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring he would not be deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment. He chose a 727-100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail-out escape, owing not only to its aft airstair but also to the high, aftward placement of all three engines, which allowed a reasonably safe jump despite the proximity of the engine exhaust. It had \"single-point fueling\" capability, a then-recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling, and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots. In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight\u2014a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary\u2014and that its operation, by a single switch in the rear of the cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit. \nAccording to Kaye's research team, Cooper's meticulous planning might also have extended to the timing of his operation and even his choice of attire. \"The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend,\" Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator had returned to his normal occupation. \"If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need as much time as possible to get out of the woods, find transportation and get home. The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime.\" Furthermore, \"if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans.\"\nThe author of an overview and comparison of World War II aircrew bailouts with Cooper's jump asserts a probability of his survival, and suggests that like copycat Martin McNally, Cooper lost the ransom during descent. The mystery of how the ransom could have been washed into Tina Bar from any Cooper jump area remains. \nThe FBI was more skeptical, concluding that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. \"We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper,\" said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team from 2006 until its dissolution in 2016. \"We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. A Boeing 727 at flaps 15 degrees and light weight probably flies at 150 knots or 172 mph. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 172 mph wind in his face wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also missed that his reserve parachute was only for training and had been sewn shut, something a skilled skydiver would have checked.\" He also failed to bring or request a helmet, chose to jump with the older and technically inferior of the two primary parachutes supplied to him, and jumped into a probable wind at in November over Washington state without proper protection against the extreme wind chill.\nThe FBI speculated from the beginning that Cooper did not survive his jump. \"Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his chute open,\" said Carr. Even if he did land safely, agents contended that survival in the mountainous terrain at the onset of winter would have been all but impossible without an accomplice at a predetermined landing point. This would have required a precisely timed jump\u2014necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There is no evidence that Cooper requested or received any such help from the crew, nor that he had any clear idea where he was when he jumped into the stormy, overcast darkness.\nRecovered ransom money.\nThe 1980 cash discovery launched several new rounds of conjecture and ultimately raised more questions than it answered. Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were founded on the assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An Army Corps of Engineers hydrologist noted that the bills had disintegrated in a \"rounded\" fashion and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried. That conclusion, if correct, supported the opinion that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin nor any tributary of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from Tina Bar. It also lent credence to supplemental speculation (see Later developments above) that placed the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.\nBut the \"free-floating\" hypothesis presented its own difficulties; it did not explain the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from the rest of the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank \"within a couple of years\" of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated, an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see Subsequent FBI disclosures above). Geological evidence suggested that the bills arrived at Tina Bar well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers dredging operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State University found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the riverbank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed. The Cooper Research Team later challenged Palmer's conclusion, citing evidence that the clay layer was a natural deposit. That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the event (based on the rubber band experiment), but does not help to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, nor from where they came.\nHimmelsbach wrote, \"I have to confess, if I [were] going to look for Cooper, I would head for the Washougal.\" The Washougal Valley and its surroundings have been searched repeatedly by private individuals and groups in subsequent years; to date, no discoveries directly traceable to the hijacking have been reported. Some investigators have speculated that the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens could have obliterated any remaining physical clues.\nAlternative theories were advanced. Some surmised that the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the riverbank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.\nAnalysis of diatoms, small algae found in water and soil, on the money suggests that the bundles found at Tina Bar could not have been submerged in the river or buried dry at the time of the hijacking in November 1971, as only diatoms that bloom during springtime were found, placing the date range that the money entered the water at least several months after the hijacking.\nStatute of limitations.\nIn 1976, discussion arose over impending expiration of the statute of limitations on the hijacking. Most published legal analyses agreed that it would make little difference, as interpretation of the statute varies considerably from case to case and court to court, and a prosecutor could argue that Cooper had forfeited immunity on any of several valid technical grounds. The question was rendered moot in November when a Portland grand jury returned an indictment \"in absentia\" against \"John Doe, \"aka\" Dan Cooper\" for air piracy and violation of the Hobbs Act. The indictment formally initiated prosecution that can be continued, should the hijacker be apprehended, at any time in the future.\nSuspects.\nBetween 1971 and 2016, the FBI processed over a thousand \"serious suspects\", including assorted publicity seekers and deathbed confessors. Some notable examples:\nKenneth Peter Christiansen.\nIn 2003, a Minnesota resident named Lyle Christiansen watched a television documentary about the Cooper hijacking and became convinced that his late brother Kenneth (1926\u20131994) was Cooper. After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director Nora Ephron (whom he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York City. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. The following year, an episode of the History series \"Brad Meltzer's Decoded\" also summarized the circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to the Cooper case.\nChristiansen enlisted in the Army in 1944 and was trained as a paratrooper. The war had ended by the time he was deployed in 1945, but he made occasional training jumps while stationed in Japan with occupation forces in the late 1940s. After leaving the Army, he joined Northwest Orient in 1954 as a mechanic in the South Pacific, and subsequently became a flight attendant, and then a purser, based in Seattle. Christiansen was 45 years old at the time of the hijacking, but he was shorter (5\u00a0ft 8 in or 173\u00a0cm), thinner (150 pounds or 68\u00a0kg), and lighter complected than eyewitness descriptions. Christiansen smoked (as did the hijacker), and displayed a particular fondness for bourbon (the drink Cooper had requested). He was also left-handed (evidence photos of Cooper's black tie show the tie clip applied from the left side, suggesting a left-handed wearer). Schaffner told a reporter that photos of Christiansen fit her memory of the hijacker's appearance more closely than those of other suspects she had been shown, but could not conclusively identify him.\nChristiansen reportedly had purchased a house with cash a few months after the hijacking. While dying of cancer in 1994, he told Lyle, \"There is something you should know, but I cannot tell you.\" Lyle said he never pressed his brother to explain. After Christiansen's death, family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in bank accounts. They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just before the date of the hijacking, although the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.\nResearch later revealed that Christiansen did not pay cash for the house he bought after the hijacking, but had a mortgage on it, and took 17 years to pay it off. The same search also uncovered evidence that Christiansen had sold off almost two dozen acres of land for $17,000 per acre in the mid 1990s, thus accounting for the large sum of money in his account at the time of his death.\nDespite the publicity generated by Porteous's book and the 2011 television documentary, the FBI is standing by its position that Christiansen cannot be considered a prime suspect. It cites a poor match to eyewitness physical descriptions, a level of skydiving expertise above that predicted by their suspect profile, and an absence of direct incriminating evidence.\nJack Coffelt.\nBryant \"Jack\" Coffelt was a con man, ex-convict, and purported government informant who claimed to have been the chauffeur and confidant of Abraham Lincoln's last undisputed descendant, great-grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith. In 1972 he began claiming he was Cooper, and attempted through an intermediary, a former cellmate named James Brown, to sell his story to a Hollywood production company. He said he landed near Mount Hood, about southeast of Ariel, injuring himself and losing the ransom money in the process. Photos of Coffelt bear a resemblance to the composite drawings, although he was in his mid-fifties in 1971. He was reportedly in Portland on the day of the hijacking, and sustained leg injuries around that time which were consistent with a skydiving mishap.\nCoffelt's account was reviewed by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in several details from information that had not been made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the CBS news program \"60 Minutes\", considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale, although it had been discredited thirty-six years before.\nLynn Doyle Cooper.\nL.D. Cooper (1931\u20131999), a leather worker and Korean War veteran, was proposed as a suspect in July 2011 by his niece, Marla Cooper. As an eight-year-old, she recalled Cooper and another uncle planning something \"very mischievous\", involving the use of \"expensive walkie-talkies\", at her grandmother's house in Sisters, Oregon, southeast of Portland. The next day flight 305 was hijacked; and though the uncles ostensibly were turkey hunting, L.D. Cooper came home wearing a bloody shirt\u2014the result, he said, of an auto accident. Later, she said, her parents came to believe that L.D. Cooper was the hijacker. She also recalled that her uncle, who died in 1999, was obsessed with the Canadian comic book hero Dan Cooper (see Theories and conjectures), and \"had one of his comic books thumbtacked to his wall\"\u2014although he was not a skydiver or paratrooper.\nIn August 2011, \"New York\" magazine published an alternative witness sketch, reportedly based on a description by Flight 305 eyewitness Robert Gregory, depicting horn-rimmed sunglasses, a \"russet\"-colored suit jacket with wide lapels, and marcelled hair. The article notes that L.D. Cooper had wavy hair that looked marcelled (as did Duane Weber). The FBI announced that no fingerprints had been found on a guitar strap made by L.D. Cooper. One week later, they added that his DNA did not match the partial DNA profile obtained from the hijacker's tie, but acknowledged, once again, that there is no certainty that the hijacker was the source of the organic material obtained from the tie. The Bureau has made no further public comment.\nBarbara Dayton.\nBarbara Dayton (1926\u20132002), a recreational pilot and University of Washington librarian who was born Robert Dayton, served in the U.S. Merchant Marine and then the Army during World War II. After discharge, Dayton worked with explosives in the construction industry and aspired to a professional airline career, but could not obtain a commercial pilot's license.\nDayton claimed to have staged the Cooper hijacking two years later, dressed as a man, to \"get back\" at the airline industry and the FAA, whose insurmountable rules and conditions had prevented her from becoming an airline pilot. Dayton said that the ransom money was hidden in a cistern near Woodburn, a suburban area south of Portland, but eventually recanted the entire story, ostensibly after learning that hijacking charges could still be brought. The FBI has never commented publicly on Dayton, who died in 2002.\nWilliam Gossett.\nWilliam Pratt Gossett (1930\u20132003) was a Marine Corps, Army, and Army Air Forces veteran who saw action in Korea and Vietnam. His military experience included advanced jump training and wilderness survival. After retiring from military service in 1973, he worked as an ROTC instructor, taught military law at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, and hosted a radio talk show in Salt Lake City that featured discussions about the paranormal. He died in 2003.\nGossett was widely known to be obsessed with the Cooper hijacking. He amassed a voluminous collection of Cooper-related news articles, and told one of his wives that he knew enough about the case to \"write the epitaph for D.B. Cooper\". Late in his life he reportedly told three of his sons, a retired Utah judge, and a friend in the Salt Lake City public defender's office that he had committed the hijacking. Photos of Gossett taken circa 1971 bear a close resemblance to the most widely circulated Cooper composite drawing.\nAccording to Galen Cook, a lawyer who has collected information related to Gossett for years, Gossett once showed his sons a key to a Vancouver, British Columbia, safe deposit box which, he claimed, contained the long-missing ransom money. Gossett's eldest son, Greg, said that his father, a compulsive gambler who was always \"strapped for cash\", showed him \"wads of cash\" just before Christmas 1971, weeks after the Cooper hijacking. He speculated that Gossett gambled the money away in Las Vegas.\nIn 1988, Gossett changed his name to \"Wolfgang\" and became a Roman Catholic priest, which Cook and others interpreted as an effort to disguise his identity. Other circumstantial evidence includes testimony that Cook claims to have obtained from William Mitchell, a passenger on the hijacked aircraft, regarding a mysterious \"physical detail\" (which he will not divulge) common to the hijacker and Gossett. Cook also claims to have found \"possible links\" to Gossett in each of four letters signed by \"D.B. Cooper\" and mailed to three newspapers within days after the hijacking, although there is no evidence that the actual hijacker created or mailed any of the letters.\nThe FBI has no direct evidence implicating Gossett, and cannot even reliably place him in the Pacific Northwest at the time of the hijacking. \"There is not one link to the D.B. Cooper case,\" said Special Agent Carr, \"other than the statements [Gossett] made to someone.\"\nRobert Richard Lepsy.\nRobert Richard Lepsy (born ) was a 33-year-old grocery store manager and married father of four from Grayling, Michigan, who disappeared in October 1969. His vehicle was found three days later at a local airport, and a man matching Lepsy's description was reportedly seen boarding a flight to Mexico. Authorities concluded that Lepsy had left voluntarily and closed their investigation.\nTwo years after the Cooper hijacking, family members noted that Lepsy's physical features resembled those in the Cooper composite drawings, and asserted that Cooper's clothing was described as very similar to Lepsy's grocery store uniform. Lepsy was declared legally dead in 1976. One of Lepsy's daughters submitted a DNA sample to the FBI in 2011, with unknown results. Although Lepsy was proposed as a Cooper suspect in a 2014 book, there is no record of public comment on him from the FBI.\nJohn List.\nJohn Emil List (1925\u20132008) was an accountant, World War II and Korean War veteran who murdered his wife, three teenage children, and 85-year-old mother in Westfield, New Jersey, fifteen days before the Cooper hijacking, withdrew $200,000 from his mother's bank account, and disappeared. He came to the attention of the Cooper task force due to the timing of his disappearance, multiple matches to the hijacker's description, and the reasoning that \"a fugitive accused of mass murder has nothing to lose.\" After his capture in 1989, List admitted to murdering his family, but denied any involvement in the Cooper hijacking. Although his name continues to crop up in Cooper articles and documentaries, no substantial evidence implicates him, and the FBI no longer considers him a suspect. He died in prison in 2008.\nTed Mayfield.\nTheodore Ernest Mayfield (1935\u20132015) was a Special Forces veteran, pilot, competitive skydiver, and skydiving instructor who served time in 1994 for negligent homicide after two of his students died when their parachutes failed to open. Later, he was found indirectly responsible for thirteen additional skydiving deaths due to faulty equipment and training. His criminal record also included armed robbery and transportation of stolen aircraft. In 2010, he was sentenced to three years' probation for piloting a plane 26 years after losing his pilot's license and rigging certificates. He was suggested repeatedly as a suspect early in the investigation, according to FBI Agent Ralph Himmelsbach, who knew Mayfield from a prior dispute at a local airport. He was ruled out, based partly on the fact that he called Himmelsbach less than two hours after Flight 305 landed in Reno to volunteer advice on standard skydiving practices and possible landing zones.\nIn 2006, two amateur researchers named Daniel Dvorak and Matthew Myers proposed Mayfield as a suspect once again, asserting that they had assembled a convincing circumstantial case. They theorized that Mayfield called Himmelsbach not to offer advice, but to establish an alibi; and they challenged Himmelsbach's conclusion that Mayfield could not possibly have found a phone in time to call the FBI less than four hours after jumping into the wilderness at night. Mayfield denied any involvement, and repeated a previous assertion that the FBI called \"him\" five times while the hijacking was still in progress to ask about parachutes, local skydivers, and skydiving techniques. (Himmelsbach said the FBI never called Mayfield.) Mayfield further charged that Dvorak and Myers asked him to play along with their theory, and \"we'll all make a lot of money\". Dvorak and Myers called any inference of collusion a \"blatant lie\". The FBI offered no comment beyond Himmelsbach's original statement that Mayfield, who died in 2015, was ruled out as a suspect early on.\nRichard Floyd McCoy, Jr..\nMcCoy (1942\u20131974) was an Army veteran who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, first as a demolition expert, and later, with the Green Berets as a helicopter pilot. After his military service he became a warrant officer in the Utah National Guard and an avid recreational skydiver, with aspirations, he said, of becoming a Utah State Trooper.\nOn April 7, 1972, McCoy staged the best-known of the so-called \"copycat\" hijackings (see below). He boarded United Airlines' Flight\u00a0855 (a Boeing\u00a0727 with aft stairs) in Denver, Colorado, and brandishing what later proved to be a paperweight resembling a hand grenade and an unloaded handgun, he demanded four parachutes and $500,000. After delivery of the money and parachutes at San Francisco International Airport, McCoy ordered the aircraft back into the sky and bailed out over Provo, Utah, leaving behind his handwritten hijacking instructions and his fingerprints on a magazine he had been reading. \nLater, a handwriting expert compared the note found on the plane with McCoy's writing on military service records and determined that McCoy had written the note. He was arrested on April 9 with the ransom cash in his possession, and after trial and conviction, received a 45-year sentence. Two years later he escaped from Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary with several accomplices by crashing a garbage truck through the main gate. Tracked down three months later in Virginia Beach, McCoy was killed in a shootout with FBI agents.\nIn their 1991 book, \"D.B. Cooper: The Real McCoy\", parole officer Bernie Rhodes and former FBI agent Russell Calame asserted that they had identified McCoy as Cooper. They cited obvious similarities in the two hijackings, claims by McCoy's family that the tie and mother-of-pearl tie clip left on the plane belonged to McCoy, and McCoy's own refusal to admit or deny that he was Cooper. A proponent of their theory was the FBI agent who killed McCoy. \"When I shot Richard McCoy,\" he said, \"I shot D. B. Cooper at the same time.\"\nAlthough there is no reasonable doubt that McCoy committed the Denver hijacking, the FBI does not consider him a suspect in the Cooper case because of mismatches in age and description; a level of skydiving skill well above that thought to be possessed by the hijacker; and credible evidence that McCoy was in Las Vegas on the day of the Portland hijacking, and at home in Utah the day after, having Thanksgiving dinner with his family.\nSheridan Peterson.\nSheridan Peterson (1926\u20142021) served in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II and was later employed as a technical editor at Boeing, based in Seattle. Investigators took an interest in Peterson as a suspect soon after the skyjacking because of his experience as a smokejumper and love of taking physical risks, as well as his similar appearance and age (44) to the Cooper description.\nPeterson often teased the media about whether he was really D.B. Cooper. Entrepreneur Eric Ulis, who spent years investigating the crime, said he was \"98% convinced\" that Peterson was Cooper; but when pressed by FBI agents, Peterson insisted he was in Nepal at the time of the skyjacking. He died in 2021.\nRobert Rackstraw.\nRobert Wesley Rackstraw (1943\u20132019) was a retired pilot and ex-convict who served on an army helicopter crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He came to the attention of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested in Iran and deported to the U.S. to face explosives possession and check kiting charges. Several months later, while released on bail, Rackstraw attempted to fake his own death by radioing a false mayday call and telling controllers that he was bailing out of a rented plane over Monterey Bay. Police later arrested him in Fullerton on an additional charge of forging federal pilot certificates; the plane he claimed to have ditched was found, repainted, in a nearby hangar. Cooper investigators noted his physical resemblance to Cooper composite sketches (although he was only 28 in 1971), military parachute training, and criminal record, but eliminated him as a suspect in 1979 after no direct evidence of his involvement could be found.\nIn 2016, Rackstraw re-emerged as a suspect in a History program and a book. On September 8, 2016, Thomas J. Colbert, the author of the book, and attorney Mark Zaid filed a lawsuit to compel the FBI to release its Cooper case file under the Freedom of Information Act. The suit alleges that the FBI suspended active investigation of the Cooper case \"in order to undermine the theory that Rackstraw is D.B. Cooper so as to prevent embarrassment for the bureau's failure to develop evidence sufficient to prosecute him for the crime.\" In January 2018, Tom and Dawna Colbert reported that they had obtained a letter originally written in December 1971 and says that the codes it contains were deciphered and matched to three units Rackstraw was a part of while in the Army. They charged that the FBI refused to acknowledge the findings because \"it would have to admit that amateur sleuths had cracked a case the bureau couldn't.\"\nOne of the Flight 305 flight attendants reportedly \"did not find any similarities\" between photos of Rackstraw from the 1970s and her recollection of Cooper's appearance. Rackstraw's attorney called the renewed allegations \"the stupidest thing I've ever heard\", and Rackstraw himself told People.com, \"It's a lot of [expletive], and they know it is.\" The FBI declined further comment. Rackstraw stated in a 2017 phone interview that he lost his job over the 2016 investigations. When approached by Colbert about claims that he was D. B. Cooper, \"I told everybody I was (the hijacker),\" Rackstraw said, before explaining the admission was a stunt.\nRackstraw died on July 9, 2019 from a heart condition.\nWalter R. Reca.\nWalter R. Reca (born Peca; 1933\u20132014) was a Michigan native, a military veteran and original member of the Michigan Parachute Team. He was proposed as a suspect by his friend Carl Laurin, a former commercial airline pilot and expert parachuter himself, at a press conference on May\u00a017, 2018. In 2008, Reca confessed to being D.B.\u00a0Cooper to Laurin via a recorded phone call. In July 2018, Principia Media released a four-part documentary detailing their investigation.\nReca gave Laurin permission in a notarized letter to share his story after he died in 2014, aged\u00a080. He also allowed Laurin to tape their phone conversations about the crime over a six-week period in late 2008. In the over three\u00a0hours of recordings, Reca gave new details about the hijacking that the public had not heard before. He also confessed to his niece, Lisa Story. Using his years of training to determine the location of the jump, Laurin concluded that D.B. Cooper landed near Cle\u00a0Elum, Washington.\nAccording to written testimony, Jeff Osiadacz, a Cle\u00a0Elum, Washington native, was driving his dump truck near Cle\u00a0Elum the night of November\u00a024, 1971, when he saw a man walking down the side of the road in the inclement weather. He assumed the man's car had broken down and was walking to get assistance. He did not have room in his truck to pick him up, and continued toward his destination, the Teanaway Junction Caf\u00e9 just outside Cle\u00a0Elum. After ordering coffee, the man from the side of the road also entered the caf\u00e9 looking like a \"drowned rat\", according to Osiadacz. The man sat next to him and asked if he would be able to give his friend directions if he called him on the phone. Osiadacz agreed to this and spoke with the man's friend, giving him directions to the caf\u00e9. Shortly after that, Osiadacz left for the Grange Hall to play in a band. The man offered to pay for his coffee, and the two amicably parted.\nLaurin began his search for the witness, after Reca described the landscape he saw while on his way to the drop zone: two bridges, some distinct lights; and his description of the exterior and interior of the caf\u00e9, as well as his encounter with Osiadacz. He described Osiadacz in detail, recalling that he was wearing western gear and had a guitar case. He dubbed him \"Cowboy\".\nLaurin consulted a map to find these landmarks and began making phone calls about the \"Cowboy who had driven a dump truck.\" Laurin was put in contact with Osiadacz, who recalled meeting a man that night, described what he was wearing and what he looked like, and confirmed his identity as Reca after seeing a photo Laurin sent him. In addition to the taped confession, Laurin also has a confession written by Reca and long underwear allegedly worn by Reca under his black pants during the hijacking.\nIn 2016, Laurin took the information to publisher Principia Media, who consulted with Joe Koenig, a forensic linguist. He evaluated all documents, including passports, identification cards, photographs, and newspaper clippings. Koenig found no evidence of tampering or manipulation and deemed all documentation authentic and contemporaneous. After comparing Laurin's research to the available FBI records, he found no discrepancies that eliminated Reca as a suspect. He also thought it particularly significant that Osiadacz's statement of events on the night of November\u00a024, 1971, was identical to the account that Reca made five years earlier. Koenig publicly stated at the Principia Media press conference on May\u00a017, 2018, that he believes that Walter R. Reca was D.B.\u00a0Cooper. Koenig later published a book on Cooper, titled \"Getting the Truth: I Am D.B. Cooper\".\nWilliam J. Smith.\nIn November 2018, \"The Oregonian\" published an article that identified William J. Smith (1928\u20132018), of Bloomfield, New Jersey, as a possible suspect. The article was based on research from a U.S. Army data analyst who sent his findings to the FBI in mid-2018. Smith, a New Jersey native, was a World War II Navy veteran and would have been 43 at the time of the hijacking. After high school, he enlisted in the Navy and volunteered for combat air crew training, citing his desire to fly. After the Navy, he worked for the Lehigh Valley Railroad and was affected by the Penn Central Transportation Company bankruptcy in 1970, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history up until that time. The article theorized that the loss of his pension created a grudge against the corporate establishment and transportation industry. It also created a sudden need for money due to that loss of pension. In Smith's high school yearbook, a list of alumni killed in World War II lists an Ira Daniel Cooper, possibly the source for the hijacker's given name of \"Dan Cooper.\" The analyst stated that Smith's Naval aviation experience would have given him knowledge of planes and parachutes, and that his railroad experience would have helped him find railroad tracks and hop on a train to escape the area after his jump. The U.S. Army analyst stated that his research began after he made connections between William J. Smith and the 1985 book \"D.B. Cooper: What Really Happened\" by Max Gunther.\n\"The Oregonian\" article states that particles such as aluminum spiral chips found on the clip-on tie could have come from a locomotive maintenance facility. Furthermore, it states that Smith's information about the Seattle area may have come from his close friend from the railroad, Dan Clair, who was stationed at Fort Lewis during World War II. Smith and Clair worked together in Newark, New Jersey, at the Oak Island Yard, with Smith retiring as a Yardmaster for Conrail. The article also noted that a website devoted to the Lehigh Valley Railroad contained a picture of Smith, and stated that \"the resemblance to the wanted-poster sketches was remarkable.\" The FBI responded to media requests on Smith by saying it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment about specific suspects.\nDuane L. Weber.\nDuane L. Weber (1924\u20131995) was a World War II Army veteran who served time in at least six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for burglary and forgery. He was proposed as a suspect by his widow, based primarily on a deathbed confession: Three days before he died in 1995, Weber told his wife Jo, \"I am Dan Cooper.\" The name meant nothing to her, she said; but months later, a friend told her of its significance in the hijacking. She went to her local library to research D.B. Cooper, found Max Gunther's book, and discovered notations in the margins in her husband's handwriting.\nJo then recalled, in retrospect, that Weber once had a nightmare during which he talked in his sleep about jumping from a plane, leaving his fingerprints on the \"aft stairs\". He also reportedly told her that an old knee injury had been incurred by \"jumping out of a plane\". Like the hijacker, Weber drank bourbon and chain smoked. Other circumstantial evidence included a 1979 trip to Seattle and the Columbia River, during which Weber took a walk alone along the river bank in the Tina Bar area; four months later Brian Ingram made his ransom cash discovery in the same area.\nThe FBI eliminated Weber as an active suspect in July 1998 when his fingerprints did not match any of those processed in the hijacked plane, and no other direct evidence could be found to implicate him. Later, his DNA also failed to match the samples recovered from Cooper's tie, though the bureau has since conceded that they cannot be certain that the organic material on the tie came from Cooper.\nSimilar hijackings.\nCooper was not the first to attempt air piracy for personal gain. In early November 1971, for example, a Canadian man named Paul Joseph Cini hijacked an Air Canada DC-8 over Montana, but was overpowered by the crew when he put down his shotgun to strap on the parachute he had brought with him. Cooper's apparent success inspired a flurry of imitators, mostly during 1972. Some notable examples from that year:\n15 hijackings similar to Cooper's\u2014all unsuccessful\u2014were attempted in 1972. With the advent of universal luggage searches in 1973 (see Airport security), the general incidence of hijackings dropped dramatically. There were no further notable Cooper imitators until July 11, 1980, when Glenn K. Tripp seized Northwest flight 608 at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, demanding $600,000 ($100,000 by an independent account), two parachutes, and the assassination of his boss. A quick-thinking flight attendant had secretly drugged Tripp's alcoholic beverage with Valium. After a 10-hour standoff, during which Tripp reduced his demands to three cheeseburgers and a head start on getting away, he was apprehended. But on January 21, 1983\u2014while still on probation\u2014he hijacked the same Northwest flight, this time en route, and demanded to be flown to Afghanistan. When the plane landed in Portland, he was shot and killed by FBI agents.\nAftermath.\nAirport security.\nThe Cooper hijacking marked the beginning of the end for unfettered and unscrutinized commercial airline travel. Despite the initiation of the federal Sky Marshal Program the previous year, 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972; 19 of them were for the specific purpose of extorting money and most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba. In 15 of the extortion cases, the hijackers also demanded parachutes. In early 1973, the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and their bags. Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives. Only two hijackings were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, one of whom intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon.\nAircraft modifications.\nIn the wake of multiple \"copycat\" hijackings in 1972, the FAA required that all Boeing\u00a0727 aircraft be fitted with a device, later dubbed the \"Cooper vane\", that prevents lowering of the aft airstair during flight. As a direct result of the hijacking, the installation of peepholes was mandated in all cockpit doors. This enables the cockpit crew to observe passengers without opening the cockpit door.\nSubsequent history of N467US.\nIn 1978, the hijacked 727-100 aircraft was sold by Northwest to Piedmont Airlines where it was re-registered N838N and continued in domestic carrier service. In 1984 it was purchased by the now-defunct charter company Key Airlines, re-registered N29KA, and incorporated into the Air Force's civilian charter fleet that shuttled workers between Nellis Air Force Base and the Tonopah Test Range during the top-secret F-117 Nighthawk development program. In 1996, the aircraft was scrapped for parts in a Memphis boneyard.\nDeath of Earl J. Cossey.\nOn April 23, 2013, Earl J. Cossey, the owner of the skydiving school that furnished the four parachutes that were given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Some commenters alleged possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they have no reason to believe that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that burglary was most likely the motive for the crime.\nIn culture.\nHimmelsbach famously called Cooper a \"rotten sleazy crook\", but his bold and adventurous crime inspired a cult following that was expressed in song, film, and literature. Restaurants and bowling alleys in the Pacific Northwest hold regular Cooper-themed promotions and sell tourist souvenirs. A \"Cooper Day\" celebration has been held at the Ariel General Store and Tavern each November since 1974 with the exception of 2015, the year its owner, Dona Elliot, died.\nCooper has appeared in the story lines of the television series \"Prison Break\", \"The Blacklist\", \"NewsRadio\", \"Leverage\", \"Journeyman\", \"Renegade\", \"Numb3rs\", \"30 Rock\", and \"Drunk History\", as well as the 1981 film \"The Pursuit of D. B. Cooper\", the 2004 film \"Without a Paddle\", and a book titled \"The Vesuvius Prophecy\", based on \"The 4400\" TV series.\nIn 2020 John Dower made the documentary \"The Mystery of D.B. Cooper\" about the case."}

{"id": "8805", "revid": "31599192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8805", "title": "Distributism", "text": "Distributism is an economic theory asserting that the world's productive assets should be widely owned rather than concentrated. Developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, distributism was based upon the principles of Catholic social teaching, especially the teachings of Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical \"Rerum novarum\" (1891) and Pope Pius XI in \"Quadragesimo anno\" (1931).\nDistributism views both \"laissez-faire\" capitalism and state socialism as equally flawed and exploitative, favoring economic mechanisms such as cooperatives and member-owned mutual organizations as well as small businesses and large-scale competition law reform such as antitrust regulations. Some Christian democratic political parties such as the American Solidarity Party have advocated distributism in their economic policies and party platform.\nOverview.\nAccording to distributists, the right to property is a fundamental right and the means of production should be spread as widely as possible rather than being centralized under the control of the state (state capitalism), a few individuals (plutocracy), or corporations (corporatocracy). Therefore, distributism advocates a society marked by widespread property ownership. Cooperative economist Race Mathews argues that such a system is key to bringing about a just social order.\nDistributism has often been described in opposition to both \"laissez-faire\" capitalism and state socialism which distributists see as equally flawed and exploitative. Furthermore, some distributists argue that state capitalism and state socialism are the logical conclusion of capitalism as capitalism's concentrated powers eventually capture the state. Thomas Storck argues: \"Both socialism and capitalism are products of the European Enlightenment and are thus modernizing and anti-traditional forces. In contrast, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, to our spiritual life, our intellectual life, our family life.\" A few distributists were influenced by the economic ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and his mutualist economic theory, and therefore the lesser-known anarchist branch of distributism of Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker Movement could be considered a form of free-market libertarian socialism due to their opposition to both state capitalism and state socialism.\nSome have seen it more as an aspiration, which has been successfully realised in the short term by commitment to the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity (these being built into financially independent local cooperatives and small family businesses), although proponents also cite such periods as the Middle Ages as examples of the historical long-term viability of distributism. Particularly influential in the development of distributist theory were Catholic authors G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc, the \"Chesterbelloc\", two of distributism's earliest and strongest proponents.\nIn the early 21st century, several observers speculated on Pope Francis's position on distributism after he denounced unfettered capitalism in his apostolic exhortation \"Evangelii gaudium\", in which he stated: \"Just as the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say 'thou shalt not' to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills. [...] A new tyranny is thus born, invisible and often virtual, which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes its own laws and rules. To all this we can add widespread corruption and self-serving tax evasion, which has taken on worldwide dimensions. The thirst for power and possessions knows no limits.\"\nBackground.\nThe mid-to-late 19th century witnessed an increase in popularity of political Catholicism across Europe. According to historian Michael A. Riff, a common feature of these movements was opposition not only to secularism, but also to both capitalism and socialism. In 1891 Pope Leo XIII promulgated \"Rerum novarum\", in which he addressed the \"misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class\" and spoke of how \"a small number of very rich men\" had been able to \"lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better than that of slavery itself\". Affirmed in the encyclical was the right of all men to own property, the necessity of a system that allowed \"as many as possible of the people to become owners\", the duty of employers to provide safe working conditions and sufficient wages, and the right of workers to unionise. Common and government property ownership was expressly dismissed as a means of helping the poor.\nAround the start of the 20th century, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc drew together the disparate experiences of the various cooperatives and friendly societies in Northern England, Ireland, and Northern Europe into a coherent political theory which specifically advocated widespread private ownership of housing and control of industry through owner-operated small businesses and worker-controlled cooperatives. In the United States in the 1930s, distributism was treated in numerous essays by Chesterton, Belloc and others in \"The American Review\", published and edited by Seward Collins. Pivotal among Belloc's and Chesterton's other works regarding distributism are \"The Servile State\", and \"Outline of Sanity\".\nAlthough a majority of distributism's later supporters were not Catholics and many were in fact former radical socialists who had become disillusioned with socialism, distributist thought was adopted by the Catholic Worker Movement, conjoining it with the thought of Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin concerning localized and independent communities. It also influenced the thought behind the Antigonish Movement, which implemented cooperatives and other measures to aid the poor in the Canadian Maritimes. Its practical implementation in the form of local cooperatives has been documented by Race Mathews in his 1999 book \"Jobs of Our Own: Building a Stakeholder Society\".\nPolitical spectrum.\nThe position of distributists when compared to other political philosophies is somewhat paradoxical and complicated (see triangulation). Strongly entrenched in an organic but very English Catholicism, advocating culturally traditionalist and agrarian values, directly challenging the precepts of Whig history\u2014Belloc was nonetheless an MP for the Liberal Party and Chesterton once stated \"As much as I ever did, more than I ever did, I believe in Liberalism. But there was a rosy time of innocence when I believed in Liberals\". This liberalism is different from most modern forms, taking influence from William Cobbett and John Ruskin, who combined elements of radicalism, challenging the establishment position, but from a perspective of renovation, not revolution; seeing themselves as trying to restore the traditional liberties of England and her people which had been taken away from them, amongst other things, since the Industrial Revolution.\nWhile converging with certain elements of traditional Toryism, especially an appreciation of the Middle Ages and organic society, there were several points of significant contention. While many Tories were strongly opposed to reform, the distributists in certain cases saw this not as conserving a legitimate traditional concept of England, but in many cases entrenching harmful errors and innovations. Belloc was quite explicit in his opposition to Protestantism as a concept and schism from the Catholic Church in general, considering the division of Christendom in the 16th century one of the most harmful events in European history. Elements of Toryism on the other hand were quite intransigent when it came to the Church of England as the established church, some even spurning their original legitimist ultra-royalist principles in regards to James II to uphold it.\nMuch of Dorothy L. Sayers' writings on social and economic matters has affinity with distributism. She may have been influenced by them, or have come to similar conclusions on her own. As an Anglican, the reasonings she gave are rooted in the theologies of Creation and Incarnation, and are slightly different from the Catholic Chesterton and Belloc.\nEconomic theory.\nPrivate property.\nUnder such a system, most people would be able to earn a living without having to rely on the use of the property of others to do so. Examples of people earning a living in this way would be farmers who own their own land and related machinery, carpenters and plumbers who own their own tools, among others. The cooperative approach advances beyond this perspective to recognise that such property and equipment may be co-owned by local communities larger than a family, e.g. partners in a business.\nIn \"Rerum novarum\", Leo XIII states that people are likely to work harder and with greater commitment if they themselves possess the land on which they labour, which in turn will benefit them and their families as workers will be able to provide for themselves and their household. He puts forward the idea that when men have the opportunity to possess property and work on it, they will \"learn to love the very soil which yields in response to the labor of their hands, not only food to eat, but an abundance of the good things for themselves and those that are dear to them\". He states also that owning property is not only beneficial for a person and their family, but is in fact a right, due to God having \"given the earth for the use and enjoyment of the whole human race\".\nSimilar views are presented by G. K. Chesterton in his 1910 book \"What's Wrong with the World\". Chesterton believes that whilst God has limitless capabilities, man has limited abilities in terms of creation. As such, man therefore is entitled to own property and to treat it as he sees fit, stating: \"Property is merely the art of the democracy. It means that every man should have something that he can shape in his own image, as he is shaped in the image of heaven. But because he is not God, but only a graven image of God, his self-expression must deal with limits; properly with limits that are strict and even small.\" Chesterton summed up his distributist views in the phrase \"Three acres and a cow\".\nAccording to Belloc, the distributive state (the state which has implemented distributism) contains \"an agglomeration of families of varying wealth, but by far the greater number of owners of the means of production\". This broader distribution does not extend to all property, but only to productive property; that is, that property which produces wealth, namely, the things needed for man to survive. It includes land, tools, and so on. Distributism allows for society to have public goods such as parks and transit systems. Distributists accept that wage labor will remain a small part of the economy, with small business owners hiring employees, usually young, inexperienced people.\nGuild system.\nThe kind of economic order envisaged by the early distributist thinkers would involve the return to some sort of guild system. The present existence of labor unions does not constitute a realization of this facet of distributist economic order, as labour unions are organized along class lines to promote class interests and frequently class struggle, whereas guilds are mixed class syndicates composed of both employers and employees cooperating for mutual benefit, thereby promoting class collaboration.\nBanks.\nDistributism favors the dissolution of the current private bank system, or more specifically its profit-making basis in charging interest. Dorothy Day, for example, suggested abolishing legal enforcement of interest-rate contracts (usury). It would not entail nationalization but could involve government involvement of some sort. Distributists look favorably towards financial cooperatives and mutuals such as credit unions, building societies and mutual banks as preferred alternatives to banks.\nAntitrust legislation.\nDistributism appears to have one of its greatest influences in antitrust legislation in America and Europe designed to break up monopolies and excessive concentration of market power in one or only a few companies, trusts, interests, or cartels. Embodying the philosophy explained by Chesterton, above, that too much capitalism means too few capitalists, not too many, America's extensive system of antitrust legislation seeks to prevent the concentration of market power in a given industry into too few hands. Requiring that no company gain too great a share of any market is an example of how distributism has found its way into government policy. The assumption behind this legislation is the idea that having economic activity decentralized among many different industry participants is better for the economy than having one or a few large players in an industry. Note that antitrust regulation does take into account cases when only large companies are viable because of the nature of an industry, as in the case of natural monopolies like electricity distribution. It also accepts that mergers and acquisitions may improve consumer welfare; however, it generally prefers more economic agents to fewer, as this generally improves competition.\nSocial credit.\nSocial credit is an interdisciplinary distributive philosophy developed by C. H. Douglas (1879\u20131952), a British engineer, who wrote a book by that name in 1924. It encompasses the fields of economics, political science, history, accounting, and physics. Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals.\nSocial theory.\nHuman family.\nDistributism sees the family of two parents and their child or children as the central and primary social unit of human ordering and the principal unit of a functioning distributist society and civilization. This unit is also the basis of a multi-generational extended family, which is embedded in socially as well as genetically inter-related communities, nations, etc., and ultimately in the whole human family past, present and future. The economic system of a society should therefore be focused primarily on the flourishing of the family unit, but not in isolation: at the appropriate level of family context, as is intended in the principle of subsidiarity. Distributism reflects this doctrine most evidently by promoting the family, rather than the individual, as the basic type of owner; that is, distributism seeks to ensure that most families, rather than most individuals, will be owners of productive property. The family is, then, vitally important to the very core of distributist thought.\nSubsidiarity.\nDistributism puts great emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity. This principle holds that no larger unit (whether social, economic, or political) should perform a function which can be performed by a smaller unit. In \"Quadragesimo anno\", Pope Pius XI provided the classical statement of the principle: \"Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to the community, so also it is an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do\". Thus, any activity of production (which distributism holds to be the most important part of any economy) ought to be performed by the smallest possible unit. This helps support distributism's argument that smaller units, families if possible, ought to be in control of the means of production, rather than the large units typical of modern economies.\nIn \"Quadragesimo anno\", Pope Pius XI further stated that \"every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social, and never destroy and absorb them\". To prevent large private organizations from thus dominating the body politic, distributism applies this principle of subsidiarity to economic as well as to social and political action.\nSocial security.\nDistributists believe in a society that is as self-reliant as possible. Some may advocate that families and charitable organisations ought to provide an alternative to social security as a means of advancing the principles of subsidiary. However, many distributists reject the idea of eliminating social security.\nDistributists such as Dorothy Day did not favour social security when it was introduced by the United States government. This rejection of the new program was due to the direct influence of the ideas of Hilaire Belloc over American distributists.\nThe Democratic Labour Party of Australia espouses distributism and does not hold the view of favouring the elimination of social security who for instance wish to \"[r]aise the level of student income support payments to the Henderson poverty line\".\nThe American Solidarity Party has a platform of favouring an adequate social security system, whereby they state: \"We advocate for social safety nets that adequately provide for the material needs of the most vulnerable in society\".\nSociety of artisans.\nDistributism promotes a society of artisans and culture. This is influenced by an emphasis on small business, promotion of local culture, and favoring of small production over capitalistic mass production. A society of artisans promotes the distributist ideal of the unification of capital, ownership, and production rather than what distributism sees as an alienation of man from work.\nThis does not suggest that distributism necessarily favors a technological regression to a pre-Industrial Revolution lifestyle, but rather a more local ownership of factories and other industrial centers. Products such as food and clothing would be preferably returned to local producers and artisans instead of being mass-produced overseas.\nGeopolitical theory.\nPolitical order.\nDistributism does not favor one political order over another (political accidentalism). While some distributists such as Dorothy Day have been anarchists, it should be remembered that most Chestertonian distributists are opposed to the mere concept of anarchism. Chesterton thought that distributism would benefit from the discipline that theoretical analysis imposes, and that distributism is best seen as a widely encompassing concept inside of which any number of interpretations and perspectives can fit. This concept should fit in a political system broadly characterized by widespread ownership of productive property.\nPolitical parties.\nIn the United States, the American Solidarity Party generally adheres to Distributist principles as its economic model. The Brazilian political party, Humanist Party of Solidarity is a distributist party, and distributism has influenced Christian Democratic parties in Continental Europe and the Democratic Labour Party in Australia. Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam view their \"Grand New Party\", a roadmap for revising the Republican Party in the United States, as \"a book written in the distributist tradition\". The Pirate Party of Romania is also considered to be a distributist party.\nWar.\nDistributists usually use just war theory in determining whether a war should be fought or not. Historical positions of distributist thinkers provide insight into a distributist position on war. Both Belloc and Chesterton opposed British imperialism in general as well as specifically opposing the Second Boer War, but they supported British involvement in World War I.\nOn the other hand, prominent distributists such as Dorothy Day and those involved in the Catholic Worker Movement were/are strict pacifists, even to the point of condemning involvement in World War II at much personal cost.\nInfluence.\nE. F. Schumacher.\nDistributism is known to have had an influence on the economist E. F. Schumacher, a convert to Catholicism.\nMondragon Corporation.\nThe Mondragon Corporation, based in the Basque Country in a region of Spain and France, was founded by a Catholic priest, Father Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arizmendiarrieta, who seems to have been influenced by the same Catholic social and economic teachings that inspired Belloc, Chesterton, Father Vincent McNabb, and the other founders of distributism.\nGuild of St Joseph and St Dominic.\nDistributist ideas were put into practice by The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, a group of artists and craftsmen who established a community in Ditchling, Sussex, England, in 1920, with the motto \"Men rich in virtue studying beautifulness living in peace in their houses\". The guild sought to recreate an idealised medieval lifestyle in the manner of the Arts and Crafts Movement. It survived almost 70 years until 1989.\nBig Society.\nThe Big Society was the flagship policy idea of the 2010 UK Conservative Party general election manifesto. Some distributists claim that the rhetorical marketing of this policy was influenced by aphorisms of the distributist ideology and promotes distributism. It purportedly formed a part of the legislative programme of the Conservative \u2013 Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement. The stated aim was \"to create a climate that empowers local people and communities, building a big society that will 'take power away from politicians and give it to people.'\" The idea of the Big Society was suggested by Steve Hilton, who worked as director of strategy for David Cameron during the Coalition government before moving on to live and work in California. Big Society gradually declined as an instrument of government policy over the course of the 2010\u20132015 government."}

It is one of the most abundant circulating steroids in humans. DHEA is produced in the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the brain. It functions as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the androgen and estrogen sex steroids both in the gonads and in various other tissues. However, DHEA also has a variety of potential biological effects in its own right, binding to an array of nuclear and cell surface receptors, and acting as a neurosteroid and modulator of neurotrophic factor receptors.\nIn the United States, DHEA is sold as an over-the-counter supplement, and medication called prasterone.\nBiological function.\nAs an androgen.\nDHEA and other adrenal androgens such as androstenedione, although relatively weak androgens, are responsible for the androgenic effects of adrenarche, such as early pubic and axillary hair growth, adult-type body odor, increased oiliness of hair and skin, and mild acne. DHEA is potentiated locally via conversion into testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the skin and hair follicles. Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a non-functional androgen receptor (AR) and are immune to the androgenic effects of DHEA and other androgens, have absent or only sparse/scanty pubic and axillary hair and body hair in general, demonstrating the role of DHEA and other androgens in body hair development at both adrenarche and pubarche.\nAs an estrogen.\nDHEA is a weak estrogen. In addition, it is transformed into potent estrogens such as estradiol in certain tissues such as the vagina, and thereby produces estrogenic effects in such tissues.\nAs a neurosteroid.\nAs a neurosteroid and neurotrophin, DHEA has important effects in the central nervous system.\nBiological activity.\nHormonal activity.\nAndrogen receptor.\nAlthough it functions as an endogenous precursor to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT, DHEA has been found to possess some degree of androgenic activity in its own right, acting as a low affinity (Ki = 1 \u03bcM), weak partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). However, its intrinsic activity at the receptor is quite weak, and on account of that, due to competition for binding with full agonists like testosterone, it can actually behave more like an antagonist depending on circulating testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, and hence, like an antiandrogen. However, its affinity for the receptor is very low, and for that reason, is unlikely to be of much significance under normal circumstances.\nEstrogen receptors.\nIn addition to its affinity for the androgen receptor, DHEA has also been found to bind to (and activate) the ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 estrogen receptors with Ki values of 1.1 \u03bcM and 0.5 \u03bcM, respectively, and EC50 values of &gt;1 \u03bcM and 200 nM, respectively. Though it was found to be a partial agonist of the ER\u03b1 with a maximal efficacy of 30\u201370%, the concentrations required for this degree of activation make it unlikely that the activity of DHEA at this receptor is physiologically meaningful. Remarkably however, DHEA acts as a full agonist of the ER\u03b2 with a maximal response similar to or actually slightly greater than that of estradiol, and its levels in circulation and local tissues in the human body are high enough to activate the receptor to the same degree as that seen with circulating estradiol levels at somewhat higher than their maximal, non-ovulatory concentrations; indeed, when combined with estradiol with both at levels equivalent to those of their physiological concentrations, overall activation of the ER\u03b2 was doubled.\nOther nuclear receptors.\nDHEA does not bind to or activate the progesterone, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid receptors. Other nuclear receptor targets of DHEA besides the androgen and estrogen receptors include the PPAR\u03b1, PXR, and CAR. However, whereas DHEA is a ligand of the PPAR\u03b1 and PXR in rodents, it is not in humans. In addition to direct interactions, DHEA is thought to regulate a handful of other proteins via indirect, genomic mechanisms, including the enzymes CYP2C11 and 11\u03b2-HSD1 \u2013 the latter of which is essential for the biosynthesis of the glucocorticoids such as cortisol and has been suggested to be involved in the antiglucocorticoid effects of DHEA \u2013 and the carrier protein IGFBP1.\nNeurosteroid activity.\nNeurotransmitter receptors.\nDHEA has been found to directly act on several neurotransmitter receptors, including acting as a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and as an agonist of the \u03c31 receptor.\nNeurotrophin receptors.\nIn 2011, the surprising discovery was made that DHEA, as well as its sulfate ester, DHEA-S, directly bind to and activate TrkA and p75NTR, receptors of neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with high affinity. DHEA was subsequently also found to bind to TrkB and TrkC with high affinity, though it only activated TrkC not TrkB. DHEA and DHEA-S bound to these receptors with affinities in the low nanomolar range (around 5\u00a0nM), which were nonetheless approximately two orders of magnitude lower relative to highly potent polypeptide neurotrophins like NGF (0.01\u20130.1\u00a0nM). In any case, DHEA and DHEA-S both circulate at requisite concentrations to activate these receptors and were thus identified as important endogenous neurotrophic factors. They have since been labeled \"steroidal microneurotrophins\", due to their small-molecule and steroidal nature relative to their polypeptide neurotrophin counterparts. Subsequent research has suggested that DHEA and/or DHEA-S may in fact be phylogenetically ancient \"ancestral\" ligands of the neurotrophin receptors from early on in the evolution of the nervous system. The findings that DHEA binds to and potently activates neurotrophin receptors may explain the positive association between decreased circulating DHEA levels with age and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.\nMicrotubule-associated protein 2.\nSimilarly to pregnenolone, its synthetic derivative 3\u03b2-methoxypregnenolone (MAP-4343), and progesterone, DHEA has been found to bind to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), specifically the MAP2C subtype (Kd = 27\u00a0\u03bcM). However, it is unclear whether DHEA increases binding of MAP2 to tubulin like pregnenolone.\nOther activity.\nG6PDH inhibitor.\nDHEA is an uncompetitive inhibitor of (Ki = 17\u00a0\u03bcM; IC50 = 18.7\u00a0\u03bcM), and is able to lower levels and reduce NADPH-dependent free radical production. It is thought that this action may possibly be responsible for much of the antiinflammatory, antihyperplastic, chemopreventative, antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, and antiobesic, as well as certain immunomodulating activities of DHEA (with some experimental evidence to support this notion available). However, it has also been said that inhibition of G6PDH activity by DHEA \"in vivo\" has not been observed and that the concentrations required for DHEA to inhibit G6PDH \"in vitro\" are very high, thus making the possible contribution of G6PDH inhibition to the effects of DHEA uncertain.\nCancer.\nDHEA supplements have been promoted for their claimed cancer prevention properties, but there is no scientific evidence to support these claims.\nMiscellaneous.\nDHEA has been found to competitively inhibit TRPV1.\nBiochemistry.\nBiosynthesis.\nDHEA is produced in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex under the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and by the gonads under the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It is also produced in the brain. DHEA is synthesized from cholesterol via the enzymes cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1; P450scc) and 17\u03b1-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), with pregnenolone and 17\u03b1-hydroxypregnenolone as intermediates. It is derived mostly from the adrenal cortex, with only about 10% being secreted from the gonads. Approximately 50 to 70% of circulating DHEA originates from desulfation of DHEA-S in peripheral tissues. DHEA-S itself originates almost exclusively from the adrenal cortex, with 95 to 100% being secreted from the adrenal cortex in women.\nIncreasing endogenous production.\nRegular exercise is known to increase DHEA production in the body. Calorie restriction has also been shown to increase DHEA in primates. Some theorize that the increase in endogenous DHEA brought about by calorie restriction is partially responsible for the longer life expectancy known to be associated with calorie restriction.\nDistribution.\nIn the circulation, DHEA is mainly bound to albumin, with a small amount bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). The small remainder of DHEA not associated with albumin or SHBG is unbound and free in the circulation.\nDHEA easily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier into the central nervous system.\nMetabolism.\nDHEA is transformed into DHEA-S by sulfation at the C3\u03b2 position via the sulfotransferase enzymes SULT2A1 and to a lesser extent SULT1E1. This occurs naturally in the adrenal cortex and during first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestines when exogenous DHEA is administered orally. Levels of DHEA-S in circulation are approximately 250 to 300 times those of DHEA. DHEA-S in turn can be converted back into DHEA in peripheral tissues via steroid sulfatase (STS).\nThe terminal half-life of DHEA is short at only 15 to 30\u00a0minutes. In contrast, the terminal half-life of DHEA-S is far longer, at 7 to 10\u00a0hours. As DHEA-S can be converted back into DHEA, it serves as a circulating reservoir for DHEA, thereby extending the duration of DHEA.\nMetabolites of DHEA include DHEA-S, 7\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA, 7\u03b2-hydroxy-DHEA, 7-keto-DHEA, 7\u03b1-hydroxyepiandrosterone, and 7\u03b2-hydroxyepiandrosterone, as well as androstenediol and androstenedione.\nPregnancy.\nDuring pregnancy, DHEA-S is metabolized into the sulfates of 16\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA and 15\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA in the fetal liver as intermediates in the production of the estrogens estriol and estetrol, respectively.\nLevels.\nPrior to puberty, DHEA and DHEA-S levels elevate upon differentiation of the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex. Peak levels of DHEA and DHEA-S are observed around age 20, which is followed by an age-dependent decline throughout life eventually back to prepubertal concentrations. Plasma levels of DHEA in adult men are 10 to 25\u00a0nM, in premenopausal women are 5 to 30\u00a0nM, and in postmenopausal women are 2 to 20\u00a0nM. Conversely, DHEA-S levels are an order of magnitude higher at 1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM. Levels of DHEA and DHEA-S decline to the lower nanomolar and micromolar ranges in men and women aged 60 to 80\u00a0years.\nDHEA levels are as follows:\nMeasurement.\nAs almost all DHEA is derived from the adrenal glands, blood measurements of DHEA-S/DHEA are useful to detect excess adrenal activity as seen in adrenal cancer or hyperplasia, including certain forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome tend to have elevated levels of DHEA-S.\nChemistry.\nDHEA, also known as androst-5-en-3\u03b2-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid and a 17-ketosteroid. It is closely related structurally to androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol), androstenedione (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione), and testosterone (androst-4-en-17\u03b2-ol-3-one). DHEA is the 5-dehydro analogue of epiandrosterone (5\u03b1-androstan-3\u03b2-ol-17-one) and is also known as 5-dehydroepiandrosterone or as \u03b45-epiandrosterone.\nIsomers.\nThe term \"dehydroepiandrosterone\" is ambiguous chemically because it does not include the specific positions within epiandrosterone at which hydrogen atoms are missing. DHEA itself is 5,6-didehydroepiandrosterone or 5-dehydroepiandrosterone. A number of naturally occurring isomers also exist and may have similar activities. Some isomers of DHEA are 1-dehydroepiandrosterone (1-androsterone) and 4-dehydroepiandrosterone. These isomers are also technically \"DHEA\", since they are dehydroepiandrosterones in which hydrogens are removed from the epiandrosterone skeleton.\nDehydroandrosterone (DHA) is the 3\u03b1-epimer of DHEA and is also an endogenous androgen.\nHistory.\nDHEA was first isolated from human urine in 1934 by Adolf Butenandt and Kurt Tscherning."}

{"id": "8811", "revid": "586364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8811", "title": "Discrete Fourier transform", "text": "In mathematics, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) converts a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function into a same-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which is a complex-valued function of frequency. The interval at which the DTFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence. An inverse DFT is a Fourier series, using the DTFT samples as coefficients of complex sinusoids at the corresponding DTFT frequencies. It has the same sample-values as the original input sequence. The DFT is therefore said to be a frequency domain representation of the original input sequence. If the original sequence spans all the non-zero values of a function, its DTFT is continuous (and periodic), and the DFT provides discrete samples of one cycle. If the original sequence is one cycle of a periodic function, the DFT provides all the non-zero values of one DTFT cycle.\nThe DFT is the most important discrete transform, used to perform Fourier analysis in many practical applications. In digital signal processing, the function is any quantity or signal that varies over time, such as the pressure of a sound wave, a radio signal, or daily temperature readings, sampled over a finite time interval (often defined by a window function). In image processing, the samples can be the values of pixels along a row or column of a raster image. The DFT is also used to efficiently solve partial differential equations, and to perform other operations such as convolutions or multiplying large integers.\nSince it deals with a finite amount of data, it can be implemented in computers by numerical algorithms or even dedicated hardware. These implementations usually employ efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms; so much so that the terms \"FFT\" and \"DFT\" are often used interchangeably. Prior to its current usage, the \"FFT\" initialism may have also been used for the ambiguous term \"finite Fourier transform\".\nDefinition.\nThe \"discrete Fourier transform\" transforms a sequence of \"N\" complex numbers formula_1 into another sequence of complex numbers, formula_2 which is defined by\nwhere the last expression follows from the first one by Euler's formula.\nThe transform is sometimes denoted by the symbol formula_3, as in formula_4 or formula_5 or formula_6.\nMotivation.\n can also be evaluated outside the domain formula_7, and that extended sequence is formula_8-periodic. Accordingly, other sequences of formula_8 indices are sometimes used, such as formula_10 (if formula_8 is even) and formula_12 (if formula_8 is odd), which amounts to swapping the left and right halves of the result of the transform.\n can be interpreted or derived in various ways, for example:\nThe normalization factor multiplying the DFT and IDFT (here 1 and formula_14) and the signs of the exponents are merely conventions, and differ in some treatments. The only requirements of these conventions are that the DFT and IDFT have opposite-sign exponents and that the product of their normalization factors be formula_14. \u00a0A normalization of formula_16 for both the DFT and IDFT, for instance, makes the transforms unitary. A discrete impulse, formula_17 at \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a00 and 0 otherwise; might transform to formula_18 for all \"k\" (use normalization factors 1 for DFT and formula_14 for IDFT). A DC signal, formula_18 at \"k\"\u00a0=\u00a00 and 0 otherwise; might inversely transform to formula_21 for all formula_22 (use formula_14 for DFT and 1 for IDFT) which is consistent with viewing DC as the mean average of the signal.\nExample.\nLet formula_24 and\nHere we demonstrate how to calculate the DFT of formula_26 using :\nInverse transform.\nThe discrete Fourier transform is an invertible, linear transformation\nwith formula_33 denoting the set of complex numbers. Its inverse is known as Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT). In other words, for any formula_34, an \"N\"-dimensional complex vector has a DFT and an IDFT which are in turn formula_8-dimensional complex vectors.\nThe inverse transform is given by:\nProperties.\nLinearity.\nThe DFT is a linear transform, i.e. if formula_36 and formula_37, then for any complex numbers formula_38:\nTime and frequency reversal.\nReversing the time (i.e. replacing formula_22 by formula_41) in formula_42 corresponds to reversing the frequency (i.e. formula_43 by formula_44). Mathematically, if formula_45 represents the vector x then\nConjugation in time.\nIf formula_36 then formula_49.\nReal and imaginary part.\nThis table shows some mathematical operations on formula_42 in the time domain and the corresponding effects on its DFT formula_51 in the frequency domain.\nOrthogonality.\nThe vectors formula_52 \nform an orthogonal basis over the set of \"N\"-dimensional complex vectors:\nwhere formula_54 is the Kronecker delta. (In the last step, the summation is trivial if formula_55, where it is 1+1+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5=\"N\", and otherwise is a geometric series that can be explicitly summed to obtain zero.) This orthogonality condition can be used to derive the formula for the IDFT from the definition of the DFT, and is equivalent to the unitarity property below.\nThe Plancherel theorem and Parseval's theorem.\nIf formula_51 and formula_57 are the DFTs of formula_42 and formula_59 respectively then the Parseval's theorem states:\nwhere the star denotes complex conjugation. Plancherel theorem is a special case of the Parseval's theorem and states:\nThese theorems are also equivalent to the unitary condition below.\nPeriodicity.\nThe periodicity can be shown directly from the definition:\nSimilarly, it can be shown that the IDFT formula leads to a periodic extension.\nShift theorem.\nMultiplying formula_42 by a \"linear phase\" formula_64 for some integer \"m\" corresponds to a \"circular shift\" of the output formula_51: formula_51 is replaced by formula_67, where the subscript is interpreted modulo \"N\" (i.e., periodically). Similarly, a circular shift of the input formula_42 corresponds to multiplying the output formula_51 by a linear phase. Mathematically, if formula_45 represents the vector x then\nCircular convolution theorem and cross-correlation theorem.\nThe convolution theorem for the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) indicates that a convolution of two sequences can be obtained as the inverse transform of the product of the individual transforms. An important simplification occurs when one of sequences is N-periodic, denoted here by formula_74 because formula_75 is non-zero at only discrete frequencies (see ), and therefore so is its product with the continuous function formula_76\u00a0 That leads to a considerable simplification of the inverse transform.\nwhere formula_78 is a periodic summation of the formula_79 sequence: \u00a0formula_80\nCustomarily, the DFT and inverse DFT summations are taken over the domain formula_81\u00a0 Defining those DFTs as formula_82 and formula_83 the result is:\nIn practice, the formula_79 sequence is usually length N or less, and formula_86 is a periodic extension of an N-length formula_87-sequence, which can also be expressed as a \"circular function\":\nThen the convolution can be written as:\n&lt;/math&gt;\nwhich gives rise to the interpretation as a \"circular\" convolution of formula_79 and formula_90\u00a0 It is often used to efficiently compute their linear convolution. (see Circular convolution, Fast convolution algorithms, and Overlap-save)\nSimilarly, the cross-correlation of \u00a0formula_79\u00a0 and \u00a0formula_86\u00a0 is given by:\nConvolution theorem duality.\nIt can also be shown that:\nTrigonometric interpolation polynomial.\nThe trigonometric interpolation polynomial\nwhere the coefficients \"X\"\"k\" are given by the DFT of \"x\"\"n\" above, satisfies the interpolation property formula_99 for formula_100.\nFor even \"N\", notice that the Nyquist component formula_101 is handled specially.\nThis interpolation is \"not unique\": aliasing implies that one could add \"N\" to any of the complex-sinusoid frequencies (e.g. changing formula_102 to formula_103 ) without changing the interpolation property, but giving \"different\" values in between the formula_42 points. The choice above, however, is typical because it has two useful properties. First, it consists of sinusoids whose frequencies have the smallest possible magnitudes: the interpolation is bandlimited. Second, if the formula_42 are real numbers, then formula_106 is real as well.\nIn contrast, the most obvious trigonometric interpolation polynomial is the one in which the frequencies range from 0 to formula_107 (instead of roughly formula_108 to formula_109 as above), similar to the inverse DFT formula. This interpolation does \"not\" minimize the slope, and is \"not\" generally real-valued for real formula_42; its use is a common mistake.\nThe unitary DFT.\nAnother way of looking at the DFT is to note that in the above discussion, the DFT can be expressed as the DFT matrix, a Vandermonde matrix, \n in 1867,\nwhere formula_112 is a primitive \"N\"th root of unity.\nThe inverse transform is then given by the inverse of the above matrix,\nWith unitary normalization constants formula_114, the DFT becomes a unitary transformation, defined by a unitary matrix:\nwhere formula_116 is the determinant function. The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, which are always formula_117 or formula_118 as described below. In a real vector space, a unitary transformation can be thought of as simply a rigid rotation of the coordinate system, and all of the properties of a rigid rotation can be found in the unitary DFT.\nThe orthogonality of the DFT is now expressed as an orthonormality condition (which arises in many areas of mathematics as described in root of unity):\nIf X is defined as the unitary DFT of the vector x, then\nand the Parseval's theorem is expressed as\nIf we view the DFT as just a coordinate transformation which simply specifies the components of a vector in a new coordinate system, then the above is just the statement that the dot product of two vectors is preserved under a unitary DFT transformation. For the special case formula_122, this implies that the length of a vector is preserved as well \u2014 this is just Plancherel theorem,\nA consequence of the circular convolution theorem is that the DFT matrix diagonalizes any circulant matrix.\nExpressing the inverse DFT in terms of the DFT.\nA useful property of the DFT is that the inverse DFT can be easily expressed in terms of the (forward) DFT, via several well-known \"tricks\". (For example, in computations, it is often convenient to only implement a fast Fourier transform corresponding to one transform direction and then to get the other transform direction from the first.)\nFirst, we can compute the inverse DFT by reversing all but one of the inputs (Duhamel \"et al.\", 1988):\nSecond, one can also conjugate the inputs and outputs:\nThird, a variant of this conjugation trick, which is sometimes preferable because it requires no modification of the data values, involves swapping real and imaginary parts (which can be done on a computer simply by modifying pointers). Define formula_128 as formula_42 with its real and imaginary parts swapped\u2014that is, if formula_130 then formula_131 is formula_132. Equivalently, formula_133 equals formula_134. Then\nThat is, the inverse transform is the same as the forward transform with the real and imaginary parts swapped for both input and output, up to a normalization (Duhamel \"et al.\", 1988).\nThe conjugation trick can also be used to define a new transform, closely related to the DFT, that is involutory\u2014that is, which is its own inverse. In particular, formula_136 is clearly its own inverse: formula_137. A closely related involutory transformation (by a factor of ) is formula_138, since the formula_139 factors in formula_140 cancel the 2. For real inputs formula_26, the real part of formula_142 is none other than the discrete Hartley transform, which is also involutory.\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nThe eigenvalues of the DFT matrix are simple and well-known, whereas the eigenvectors are complicated, not unique, and are the subject of ongoing research.\nConsider the unitary form formula_143 defined above for the DFT of length \"N\", where\nThis matrix satisfies the matrix polynomial equation:\nThis can be seen from the inverse properties above: operating formula_143 twice gives the original data in reverse order, so operating formula_143 four times gives back the original data and is thus the identity matrix. This means that the eigenvalues formula_148 satisfy the equation:\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of formula_143 are the fourth roots of unity: formula_148 is +1, \u22121, +\"i\", or \u2212\"i\".\nSince there are only four distinct eigenvalues for this formula_152 matrix, they have some multiplicity. The multiplicity gives the number of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. (There are \"N\" independent eigenvectors; a unitary matrix is never defective.)\nThe problem of their multiplicity was solved by McClellan and Parks (1972), although it was later shown to have been equivalent to a problem solved by Gauss (Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982). The multiplicity depends on the value of \"N\" modulo 4, and is given by the following table:\nOtherwise stated, the characteristic polynomial of formula_143 is:\nNo simple analytical formula for general eigenvectors is known. Moreover, the eigenvectors are not unique because any linear combination of eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue is also an eigenvector for that eigenvalue. Various researchers have proposed different choices of eigenvectors, selected to satisfy useful properties like orthogonality and to have \"simple\" forms (e.g., McClellan and Parks, 1972; Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982; Gr\u00fcnbaum, 1982; Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997; Candan \"et al.\", 2000; Hanna \"et al.\", 2004; Gurevich and Hadani, 2008).\nA straightforward approach is to discretize an eigenfunction of the continuous Fourier transform,\nof which the most famous is the Gaussian function.\nSince periodic summation of the function means discretizing its frequency spectrum\nand discretization means periodic summation of the spectrum,\nthe discretized and periodically summed Gaussian function yields an eigenvector of the discrete transform:\nThe closed form expression for the series can be expressed by Jacobi theta functions as\nTwo other simple closed-form analytical eigenvectors for special DFT period \"N\" were found (Kong, 2008):\nFor DFT period \"N\" = 2\"L\" + 1 = 4\"K\" + 1, where \"K\" is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:\nFor DFT period \"N\" = 2\"L\" = 4\"K\", where \"K\" is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:\nThe choice of eigenvectors of the DFT matrix has become important in recent years in order to define a discrete analogue of the fractional Fourier transform\u2014the DFT matrix can be taken to fractional powers by exponentiating the eigenvalues (e.g., Rubio and Santhanam, 2005). For the continuous Fourier transform, the natural orthogonal eigenfunctions are the Hermite functions, so various discrete analogues of these have been employed as the eigenvectors of the DFT, such as the Kravchuk polynomials (Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997). The \"best\" choice of eigenvectors to define a fractional discrete Fourier transform remains an open question, however.\nUncertainty principles.\nProbabilistic uncertainty principle.\nIf the random variable is constrained by\nthen \nmay be considered to represent a discrete probability mass function of , with an associated probability mass function constructed from the transformed variable,\nFor the case of continuous functions formula_162 and formula_163, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that\nwhere formula_165 and formula_166 are the variances of formula_167 and formula_168 respectively, with the equality attained in the case of a suitably normalized Gaussian distribution. Although the variances may be analogously defined for the DFT, an analogous uncertainty principle is not useful, because the uncertainty will not be shift-invariant. Still, a meaningful uncertainty principle has been introduced by Massar and Spindel.\nHowever, the Hirschman entropic uncertainty will have a useful analog for the case of the DFT. The Hirschman uncertainty principle is expressed in terms of the Shannon entropy of the two probability functions.\nIn the discrete case, the Shannon entropies are defined as\nand\nand the entropic uncertainty principle becomes\nThe equality is obtained for formula_172 equal to translations and modulations of a suitably normalized Kronecker comb of period formula_173 where formula_173 is any exact integer divisor of formula_8. The probability mass function formula_176 will then be proportional to a suitably translated Kronecker comb of period formula_177.\nDeterministic uncertainty principle.\nThere is also a well-known deterministic uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients). Let formula_178 and formula_179 be the number of non-zero elements of the time and frequency sequences formula_180 and formula_181, respectively. Then, \nAs an immediate consequence of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, one also has formula_183. Both uncertainty principles were shown to be tight for specifically-chosen \"picket-fence\" sequences (discrete impulse trains), and find practical use for signal recovery applications.\nDFT of real and purely imaginary signals.\nIt follows that for even formula_8 formula_189 and formula_190 are real-valued, and the remainder of the DFT is completely specified by just formula_191 complex numbers.\nGeneralized DFT (shifted and non-linear phase).\nIt is possible to shift the transform sampling in time and/or frequency domain by some real shifts \"a\" and \"b\", respectively. This is sometimes known as a generalized DFT (or GDFT), also called the shifted DFT or offset DFT, and has analogous properties to the ordinary DFT:\nMost often, shifts of formula_197 (half a sample) are used.\nWhile the ordinary DFT corresponds to a periodic signal in both time and frequency domains, formula_198 produces a signal that is anti-periodic in frequency domain (formula_199) and vice versa for formula_200.\nThus, the specific case of formula_201 is known as an \"odd-time odd-frequency\" discrete Fourier transform (or O2 DFT).\nSuch shifted transforms are most often used for symmetric data, to represent different boundary symmetries, and for real-symmetric data they correspond to different forms of the discrete cosine and sine transforms.\nAnother interesting choice is formula_202, which is called the centered DFT (or CDFT). The centered DFT has the useful property that, when \"N\" is a multiple of four, all four of its eigenvalues (see above) have equal multiplicities (Rubio and Santhanam, 2005)\nThe term GDFT is also used for the non-linear phase extensions of DFT. Hence, GDFT method provides a generalization for constant amplitude orthogonal block transforms including linear and non-linear phase types. GDFT is a framework \nto improve time and frequency domain properties of the traditional DFT, e.g. auto/cross-correlations, by the addition of the properly designed phase shaping function (non-linear, in general) to the original linear phase functions (Akansu and Agirman-Tosun, 2010).\nThe discrete Fourier transform can be viewed as a special case of the z-transform, evaluated on the unit circle in the complex plane; more general z-transforms correspond to \"complex\" shifts \"a\" and \"b\" above.\nMultidimensional DFT.\nThe ordinary DFT transforms a one-dimensional sequence or array formula_42 that is a function of exactly one discrete variable \"n\". The multidimensional DFT of a multidimensional array formula_204 that is a function of \"d\" discrete variables formula_205 for formula_206 in formula_207 is defined by:\nwhere formula_209 as above and the \"d\" output indices run from formula_210. This is more compactly expressed in vector notation, where we define formula_211 and formula_212 as \"d\"-dimensional vectors of indices from 0 to formula_213, which we define as formula_214:\nwhere the division formula_216 is defined as formula_217 to be performed element-wise, and the sum denotes the set of nested summations above.\nThe inverse of the multi-dimensional DFT is, analogous to the one-dimensional case, given by:\nAs the one-dimensional DFT expresses the input formula_42 as a superposition of sinusoids, the multidimensional DFT expresses the input as a superposition of plane waves, or multidimensional sinusoids. The direction of oscillation in space is formula_220. The amplitudes are formula_221. This decomposition is of great importance for everything from digital image processing (two-dimensional) to solving partial differential equations. The solution is broken up into plane waves.\nThe multidimensional DFT can be computed by the composition of a sequence of one-dimensional DFTs along each dimension. In the two-dimensional case formula_222 the formula_223 independent DFTs of the rows (i.e., along formula_224) are computed first to form a new array formula_225. Then the formula_226 independent DFTs of \"y\" along the columns (along formula_227) are computed to form the final result formula_228. Alternatively the columns can be computed first and then the rows. The order is immaterial because the nested summations above commute.\nAn algorithm to compute a one-dimensional DFT is thus sufficient to efficiently compute a multidimensional DFT. This approach is known as the \"row-column\" algorithm. There are also intrinsically multidimensional FFT algorithms.\nThe real-input multidimensional DFT.\nFor input data formula_204 consisting of real numbers, the DFT outputs have a conjugate symmetry similar to the one-dimensional case above:\nwhere the star again denotes complex conjugation and the formula_206-th subscript is again interpreted modulo formula_232 (for formula_233).\nApplications.\nThe DFT has seen wide usage across a large number of fields; we only sketch a few examples below (see also the references at the end). All applications of the DFT depend crucially on the availability of a fast algorithm to compute discrete Fourier transforms and their inverses, a fast Fourier transform.\nSpectral analysis.\nWhen the DFT is used for signal spectral analysis, the formula_234 sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal formula_235, where formula_236 represents time. The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying Fourier transform of formula_237 into a discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called aliasing. Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see \"Nyquist rate\") is the key to minimizing that distortion. Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called \"leakage\", which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT. Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect. When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a spectrogram. If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the variance of the spectrum (also called a periodogram in this context); two examples of such techniques are the Welch method and the Bartlett method; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called spectral estimation.\nA final source of distortion (or perhaps \"illusion\") is the DFT itself, because it is just a discrete sampling of the DTFT, which is a function of a continuous frequency domain. That can be mitigated by increasing the resolution of the DFT. That procedure is illustrated at .\nFilter bank.\nSee and .\nData compression.\nThe field of digital signal processing relies heavily on operations in the frequency domain (i.e. on the Fourier transform). For example, several lossy image and sound compression methods employ the discrete Fourier transform: the signal is cut into short segments, each is transformed, and then the Fourier coefficients of high frequencies, which are assumed to be unnoticeable, are discarded. The decompressor computes the inverse transform based on this reduced number of Fourier coefficients. (Compression applications often use a specialized form of the DFT, the discrete cosine transform or sometimes the modified discrete cosine transform.)\nSome relatively recent compression algorithms, however, use wavelet transforms, which give a more uniform compromise between time and frequency domain than obtained by chopping data into segments and transforming each segment. In the case of JPEG2000, this avoids the spurious image features that appear when images are highly compressed with the original JPEG.\nPartial differential equations.\nDiscrete Fourier transforms are often used to solve partial differential equations, where again the DFT is used as an approximation for the Fourier series (which is recovered in the limit of infinite \"N\"). The advantage of this approach is that it expands the signal in complex exponentials formula_238, which are eigenfunctions of differentiation: formula_239. Thus, in the Fourier representation, differentiation is simple\u2014we just multiply by formula_240. (However, the choice of formula_22 is not unique due to aliasing; for the method to be convergent, a choice similar to that in the trigonometric interpolation section above should be used.) A linear differential equation with constant coefficients is transformed into an easily solvable algebraic equation. One then uses the inverse DFT to transform the result back into the ordinary spatial representation. Such an approach is called a spectral method.\nPolynomial multiplication.\nSuppose we wish to compute the polynomial product \"c\"(\"x\") = \"a\"(\"x\") \u00b7 \"b\"(\"x\"). The ordinary product expression for the coefficients of \"c\" involves a linear (acyclic) convolution, where indices do not \"wrap around.\" This can be rewritten as a cyclic convolution by taking the coefficient vectors for \"a\"(\"x\") and \"b\"(\"x\") with constant term first, then appending zeros so that the resultant coefficient vectors a and b have dimension \"d\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0deg(\"a\"(\"x\"))\u00a0+\u00a0deg(\"b\"(\"x\")). Then,\nWhere c is the vector of coefficients for \"c\"(\"x\"), and the convolution operator formula_243 is defined so\nBut convolution becomes multiplication under the DFT:\nHere the vector product is taken elementwise. Thus the coefficients of the product polynomial \"c\"(\"x\") are just the terms 0, ..., deg(\"a\"(\"x\")) + deg(\"b\"(\"x\")) of the coefficient vector\nWith a fast Fourier transform, the resulting algorithm takes O (\"N\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"N\") arithmetic operations. Due to its simplicity and speed, the Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm, which is limited to composite sizes, is often chosen for the transform operation. In this case, \"d\" should be chosen as the smallest integer greater than the sum of the input polynomial degrees that is factorizable into small prime factors (e.g. 2, 3, and 5, depending upon the FFT implementation).\nMultiplication of large integers.\nThe fastest known algorithms for the multiplication of very large integers use the polynomial multiplication method outlined above. Integers can be treated as the value of a polynomial evaluated specifically at the number base, with the coefficients of the polynomial corresponding to the digits in that base (ex. formula_247). After polynomial multiplication, a relatively low-complexity carry-propagation step completes the multiplication.\nConvolution.\nWhen data is convolved with a function with wide support, such as for downsampling by a large sampling ratio, because of the Convolution theorem and the FFT algorithm, it may be faster to transform it, multiply pointwise by the transform of the filter and then reverse transform it. Alternatively, a good filter is obtained by simply truncating the transformed data and re-transforming the shortened data set.\nGeneralizations.\nRepresentation theory.\nThe DFT can be interpreted as a complex-valued representation of the finite cyclic group. In other words, a sequence of formula_22 complex numbers can be thought of as an element of formula_22-dimensional complex space formula_250 or equivalently a function formula_251 from the finite cyclic group of order formula_22 to the complex numbers, formula_253. So formula_251 is a class function on the finite cyclic group, and thus can be expressed as a linear combination of the irreducible characters of this group, which are the roots of unity.\nFrom this point of view, one may generalize the DFT to representation theory generally, or more narrowly to the representation theory of finite groups.\nMore narrowly still, one may generalize the DFT by either changing the target (taking values in a field other than the complex numbers), or the domain (a group other than a finite cyclic group), as detailed in the sequel.\nOther fields.\nMany of the properties of the DFT only depend on the fact that formula_255 is a primitive root of unity, sometimes denoted formula_256 or formula_257 (so that formula_258). Such properties include the completeness, orthogonality, Plancherel/Parseval, periodicity, shift, convolution, and unitarity properties above, as well as many FFT algorithms. For this reason, the discrete Fourier transform can be defined by using roots of unity in fields other than the complex numbers, and such generalizations are commonly called \"number-theoretic transforms\" (NTTs) in the case of finite fields. For more information, see number-theoretic transform and discrete Fourier transform (general).\nOther finite groups.\nThe standard DFT acts on a sequence \"x\"0, \"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"N\"\u22121 of complex numbers, which can be viewed as a function {0, 1, ..., \"N\" \u2212 1} \u2192 C. The multidimensional DFT acts on multidimensional sequences, which can be viewed as functions\nThis suggests the generalization to Fourier transforms on arbitrary finite groups, which act on functions \"G\" \u2192 C where \"G\" is a finite group. In this framework, the standard DFT is seen as the Fourier transform on a cyclic group, while the multidimensional DFT is a Fourier transform on a direct sum of cyclic groups.\nFurther, Fourier transform can be on cosets of a group.\nAlternatives.\n There are various alternatives to the DFT for various applications, prominent among which are wavelets. The analog of the DFT is the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). From the point of view of time\u2013frequency analysis, a key limitation of the Fourier transform is that it does not include \"location\" information, only \"frequency\" information, and thus has difficulty in representing transients. As wavelets have location as well as frequency, they are better able to represent location, at the expense of greater difficulty representing frequency. For details, see comparison of the discrete wavelet transform with the discrete Fourier transform."}

Such dual figures remain combinatorial or abstract polyhedra, but not all are also geometric polyhedra. Starting with any given polyhedron, the dual of its dual is the original polyhedron.\nDuality preserves the symmetries of a polyhedron. Therefore, for many classes of polyhedra defined by their symmetries, the duals also belong to a symmetric class. Thus, the regular polyhedrathe (convex) Platonic solids and (star) Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedraform dual pairs, where the regular tetrahedron is self-dual. The dual of an isogonal polyhedron, having equivalent vertices, is one which is isohedral, having equivalent faces. The dual of an isotoxal polyhedron (having equivalent edges) is also isotoxal.\nDuality is closely related to \"reciprocity\" or \"polarity\", a geometric transformation that, when applied to a convex polyhedron, realizes the dual polyhedron as another convex polyhedron.\nKinds of duality.\nThere are many kinds of duality. The kinds most relevant to elementary polyhedra are polar reciprocity and topological or abstract duality.\nPolar reciprocation.\nThe dual of polyhedron formula_1 is often defined in terms of polar reciprocation about a sphere. Here, each vertex (pole) is associated with a face plane (polar plane or just polar) so that the ray from the center to the vertex is perpendicular to the plane, and the product of the distances from the center to each is equal to the square of the radius.\nWhen the sphere has radius formula_2 and is centered at the origin, i.e. defined by equation formula_3 and formula_1 is a convex polyhedron, then its polar dual is defined as\nwhere formula_6 denotes the standard dot product of formula_7 and formula_8.\nTypically when no sphere is specified in the construction of the dual, then the unit sphere is used, meaning formula_9 in the above definitions.\nFor each face of formula_1 described by the linear equation\nthe dual polyhedron formula_12 will have a vertex formula_13. Similarly, each vertex of formula_1 corresponds to a face of formula_12, and each edge of formula_1 corresponds to an edge of formula_12. The correspondence between the vertices, edges, and faces of formula_1 and formula_12 reverses inclusion. For example, if an edge of formula_1 contains a vertex, the corresponding edge of formula_12 will be contained in the corresponding face.\nFor symmetrical polyhedra having an obvious centroid, it is common to make the polyhedron and sphere concentric, as in the Dorman Luke construction described below. If multiple symmetry axes are present, they will necessarily intersect at a single point, and this is usually taken to be the centroid. Failing that, a circumscribed sphere, inscribed sphere, or midsphere (one with all edges as tangents) is commonly used.\nHowever, it is possible to reciprocate a polyhedron about any sphere, and the resulting form of the dual will depend on the size and position of the sphere; as the sphere is varied, so too is the dual form. The choice of center for the sphere is sufficient to define the dual up to similarity.\nIf a polyhedron in Euclidean space has an element passing through the center of the sphere, the corresponding element of its dual will go to infinity. Since Euclidean space never reaches infinity, the projective equivalent, called extended Euclidean space, may be formed by adding the required 'plane at infinity'. Some theorists prefer to stick to Euclidean space and say that there is no dual. Meanwhile, found a way to represent these infinite duals, in a manner suitable for making models (of some finite portion).\nThe concept of \"duality\" here is closely related to the duality in projective geometry, where lines and edges are interchanged. Projective polarity works well enough for convex polyhedra. But for non-convex figures such as star polyhedra, when we seek to rigorously define this form of polyhedral duality in terms of projective polarity, various problems appear. \nBecause of the definitional issues for geometric duality of non-convex polyhedra, argues that any proper definition of a non-convex polyhedron should include a notion of a dual polyhedron.\nCanonical duals.\nAny convex polyhedron can be distorted into a canonical form, in which a unit midsphere (or intersphere) exists tangent to every edge, and such that the average position of the points of tangency is the center of the sphere. This form is unique up to congruences.\nIf we reciprocate such a canonical polyhedron about its midsphere, the dual polyhedron will share the same edge-tangency points and so must also be canonical. It is the canonical dual, and the two together form a canonical dual pair.\nTopological duality.\nEven when a pair of polyhedra cannot be obtained by reciprocation from each other, they may be called duals of each other as long as the vertices of one correspond to the faces of the other, and the edges of one correspond to the edges of the other, in an incidence-preserving way. Such pairs of polyhedra are still topologically or abstractly dual.\nThe vertices and edges of a convex polyhedron form a graph (the 1-skeleton of the polyhedron), embedded on a topological sphere, the surface of the polyhedron.\nThe same graph can be projected to form a Schlegel diagram on a flat plane. The graph formed by the edges and vertices of the dual polyhedron is its dual graph. More generally, for any polyhedron whose faces form a closed surface, the vertices and edges of the polyhedron form a graph embedded on this surface, and the vertices and edges of the (abstract) dual polyhedron form the dual graph.\nAn abstract polyhedron is a certain kind of partially ordered set (poset) of elements, such that adjacencies, or connections, between elements of the set correspond to adjacencies between elements (faces, edges, etc.) of a polyhedron. Every such poset has a dual poset, formed by reversing all of the order relations. If the poset is visualized as a Hasse diagram, the dual poset may be visualized simply by turning the Hasse diagram upside down.\nEvery geometric polyhedron corresponds to an abstract polyhedron in this way, and has an abstract dual polyhedron. However, for some types of non-convex geometric polyhedron, the dual polyhedron may not be realized geometrically.\nDorman Luke construction.\nFor a uniform polyhedron, the face of the dual polyhedron may be found from the original polyhedron's vertex figure using the Dorman Luke construction.\nAs an example, the illustration below shows the vertex figure (red) of the cuboctahedron being used to derive a face (blue) of the rhombic dodecahedron.\nBefore beginning the construction, the vertex figure \"ABCD\" is obtained by cutting each connected edge at (in this case) its midpoint.\nDorman Luke's construction then proceeds:\nIn this example the size of the vertex figure was chosen so that its circumcircle lies on the intersphere of the cuboctahedron, which also becomes the intersphere of the dual rhombic dodecahedron.\nDorman Luke's construction can only be used where a polyhedron has such an intersphere and the vertex figure is cyclic. For instance, it can be applied to the uniform polyhedra.\nSelf-dual polyhedra.\nTopologically, a self-dual polyhedron is one whose dual has exactly the same connectivity between vertices, edges and faces. Abstractly, they have the same Hasse diagram.\nA geometrically self-dual polyhedron is not only topologically self-dual, but its polar reciprocal about a certain point, typically its centroid, is a similar figure. For example, the dual of a regular tetrahedron is another regular tetrahedron, reflected through the origin.\nEvery polygon is topologically self-dual (it has the same number of vertices as edges, and these are switched by duality), but will not in general be geometrically self-dual (up to rigid motion, for instance). Every polygon has a regular form which is geometrically self-dual about its intersphere: all angles are congruent, as are all edges, so under duality these congruences swap.\nSimilarly, every topologically self-dual convex polyhedron can be realized by an equivalent geometrically self-dual polyhedron, its canonical polyhedron, reciprocal about the center of the midsphere.\nThere are infinitely many geometrically self-dual polyhedra. The simplest infinite family are the canonical pyramids of \"n\" sides. Another infinite family, elongated pyramids, consists of polyhedra that can be roughly described as a pyramid sitting on top of a prism (with the same number of sides). Adding a frustum (pyramid with the top cut off) below the prism generates another infinite family, and so on.\nThere are many other convex, self-dual polyhedra. For example, there are 6 different ones with 7 vertices, and 16 with 8 vertices.\nA self-dual non-convex icosahedron with hexagonal faces was identified by Br\u00fcckner in 1900. Other non-convex self-dual polyhedra have been found, under certain definitions of non-convex polyhedra and their duals.\nDual polytopes and tessellations.\nDuality can be generalized to \"n\"-dimensional space and dual polytopes; in two dimension these are called dual polygons.\nThe vertices of one polytope correspond to the (\"n\" \u2212 1)-dimensional elements, or facets, of the other, and the \"j\" points that define a (\"j\" \u2212 1)-dimensional element will correspond to \"j\" hyperplanes that intersect to give a (\"n\" \u2212 \"j\")-dimensional element. The dual of an \"n\"-dimensional tessellation or honeycomb can be defined similarly.\nIn general, the facets of a polytope's dual will be the topological duals of the polytope's vertex figures. For the polar reciprocals of the regular and uniform polytopes, the dual facets will be polar reciprocals of the original's vertex figure. For example, in four dimensions, the vertex figure of the 600-cell is the icosahedron; the dual of the 600-cell is the 120-cell, whose facets are dodecahedra, which are the dual of the icosahedron.\nSelf-dual polytopes and tessellations.\nThe primary class of self-dual polytopes are regular polytopes with palindromic Schl\u00e4fli symbols. All regular polygons, {a} are self-dual, polyhedra of the form {a,a}, 4-polytopes of the form {a,b,a}, 5-polytopes of the form {a,b,b,a}, etc.\nThe self-dual regular polytopes are:\nThe self-dual (infinite) regular Euclidean honeycombs are:\nThe self-dual (infinite) regular hyperbolic honeycombs are:"}
